{"Conflict":true,"Explanation":"There is a potential drug-drug interaction between Amlodipine and Metformin. Amlodipine can slightly increase the blood levels of Metformin, which may lead to an increased risk of Metformin-related side effects such as lactic acidosis.","Alternative":["Consider monitoring for signs of Metformin toxicity when used concomitantly with Amlodipine. Adjust the Metformin dose if necessary under healthcare provider supervision."]}
