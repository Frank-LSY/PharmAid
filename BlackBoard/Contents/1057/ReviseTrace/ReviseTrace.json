                "DrugName": "Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)",
                "UsagePlan": "Take 300-600 mg orally twice a day with meals. The dose may be adjusted based on response.",
                "AdminstrationRoute": "Oral",
                "Explanation": "UDCA is recommended for choledocholithiasis as it helps dissolve cholesterol stones in the bile duct, facilitating their elimination. It can also improve liver function and reduce the risk of complications from gallstones."

                "AdminstrationRoute": "Intravenous or Intramuscular",
                "Explanation": "Antibiotics are important in the context of pneumonia and duodenal perforation which are part of the patient's diagnosis. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly used for respiratory infections and intra-abdominal infections."

                "DrugName": "Pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen)",

                "AdminstrationRoute": "Oral",
                "Explanation": "Pain relief is essential for managing symptoms associated with duodenal perforation and choledocholithiasis. Acetaminophen is a suitable choice for mild to moderate pain and is less likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects compared to NSAIDs."
