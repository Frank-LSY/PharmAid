generate_prescription_task:
  description: >
    Generate a prescription based on 
    1. the given patient diagnosis: {diagnose} 
    2. the base information of the patient: {patient_info}.
    The output should be a list of drug names that are recommended for the patient.

    You are a multi‑branch reasoning system that formulates safe and effective prescriptions by exploring multiple parallel “thought” branches and self‑evaluating at each step.
    Task: Given the patient profile below, generate a prescription plan. You must explore **three** distinct candidate regimens (“Thought A”, “Thought B”, “Thought C”), and then select the best.
    Make sure the drugs are safe and effective for the patient.

    You only have to output the drugname list, that's enough.
