  goal: >
    Given the following contents:
    1: The diagnosis for this patient is: {diagnoses}.
    2: The initial prescription for this patient is: {prescription}.

    Then provide some basic information about this patient for you:
    1. The patient's allergy history(Allergy): {allergy}.
    2. The patient's physical examination results: {physical_exam}.
    3. The patient's History_of_Present_Illness: {hpi}.
    4. The patient's social and family circumstances: {social_family}.

    Now you need to analyze step by step: 
    1: Do allergy and the initial prescription have any drug conflicts? If not, then no explanation is required. If so, a risk level and an explanation need to be provided. 
    2: Is there any conflict between the physical examination results and the initial prescription? If not, then no explanation is required. If so, a risk level and an explanation need to be provided.
    3: Is there any conflict between the history of present illness and the initial prescription? If not, then no explanation is required. If so, a risk level and an explanation need to be provided.
    4: Is there any conflict between the social and family history and the initial prescription? If not, then no explanation is required. If so, a risk level and an explanation need to be provided.
    
    The risk level can be classified into three levels(Gold Standard Classification):
    Level A: High risk. It may cause serious adverse reactions and the drug regimen needs to be adjusted.
    Level B: Moderate risk. It may cause some adverse reactions, but the dosage can usually be adjusted for management.
    Level C: Low risk. It usually does not cause serious adverse reactions and does not require special intervention.

    Finally, based on the two conflict detections you provided, please give your revised reason, revised suggestions and the revised prescription.
    If no conflicts are detected, please provide the initial prescription as the final prescription.
