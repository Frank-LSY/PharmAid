  "Reflections": "The differences between the standard prescription and the final output prescription are likely due to patient-specific customization, risk mitigation, or system heuristic. The addition of Lorazepam may be necessary to manage non-epileptic seizures more effectively. Fluoxetine is added to treat underlying mood disorders contributing to seizures. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Physical Therapy are added as part of the treatment plan to address psychological factors and improve overall physical health, respectively.",
  "Guidance": [
    "If a patient has psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, consider adding Lorazepam or Fluoxetine to their medication regimen based on individualized needs.",
    "Regular therapy sessions with CBT may be necessary to address underlying psychological stressors and improve coping mechanisms.",
    "Physical Therapy should be considered as part of the treatment plan to improve overall physical health and reduce stress levels.",
    "For patients taking antiepileptic medications like Levetiracetam, close medical supervision is recommended to monitor for any side effects and adjust dosages accordingly."
