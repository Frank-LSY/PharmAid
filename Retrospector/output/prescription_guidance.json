{"Differences":[{"Added_Medications":[{"DrugName":"Acetaminophen","UsagePlan":"Take 500mg-1000mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain relief. Do not exceed 4g (4000mg) in a 24-hour period.","AdminstrationRoute":"Oral","Explanation":"Acetaminophen is chosen for pain relief in the headache associated with intra-parenchymal hemorrhage. It is effective in managing mild to moderate pain without affecting platelet function, which is crucial in cases of hemorrhage. Additionally, there are no conflicts identified with other medications."},{"DrugName":"Morphine","UsagePlan":"Administer as needed for severe pain. Start with 2.5-5 mg every 4 hours as needed for breakthrough pain. Adjust dosage based on pain intensity and response.","AdminstrationRoute":"Oral or Intravenous","Explanation":"Morphine is recommended as an alternative to Fentanyl to manage severe pain associated with intra-parenchymal hemorrhage. It is an effective opioid analgesic but with a lower risk of respiratory depression compared to Fentanyl based on the DDI feedback, reducing the potential risk of adverse effects."}]},{"Removed_Medications":[{"DrugName":"Losartan Potassium 150 mg PO DAILY","Dose":"100 mg","Frequency":"1.5 tablets by mouth once a day","Disp":"#45 Tablet Refills:#0"},{"DrugName":"Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg PO DAILY"},{"DrugName":"Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg PO QPM"},{"DrugName":"HELD- Aspir-81 (aspirin) 81 mg oral DAILY","Notes":"This medication was held. Do not restart Aspir-81 until told to resume from a neurologist"}]}],"Reflections":"The differences observed are mainly due to the pain management approach in the final output prescription, with the addition of Acetaminophen and Morphine while removing the previous medications indicated for other conditions. This change reflects a shift towards addressing pain specifically related to intra-parenchymal hemorrhage.","Guidance":["Trigger condition: Diagnosis of intra-parenchymal hemorrhage requiring pain management. Recommended action: Consider the use of Acetaminophen and Morphine for pain relief based on the severity. Expected outcome: Improved pain management tailored to the patient's condition.","Trigger condition: Need for cardiovascular and cholesterol management in patients with intra-parenchymal hemorrhage. Recommended action: Reconsider the continuation of Losartan, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Rosuvastatin based on the patient's overall condition and individual risk factors. Expected outcome: Optimized cardiovascular care while ensuring safety.","Trigger condition: History of Aspirin use with current intra-parenchymal hemorrhage. Recommended action: Collaborate closely with a neurologist before restarting Aspir-81 to manage the bleeding risk effectively. Expected outcome: Safe resumption of Aspirin therapy under neurologist supervision."]}
