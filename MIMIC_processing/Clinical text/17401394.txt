STUDIES/REPORTS:
================
___ CXR PA & LAT
Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  
Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  The 
pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are clear without 
focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is 
present.  Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic 
spine.  Surgical anchor is noted in the left humeral head. 

___ CTA CHEST
FINDINGS:  
The aorta and its major branch vessels are patent, with no 
evidence of 
stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysmal formation.  There 
is no 
evidence of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or aortic arch 
atheroma present. There is a mild amount of atherosclerotic 
calcification along the aortic arch.  The pulmonary arteries are 
well opacified to the subsegmental level, with no evidence of 
filling defect within the main, right, left, lobar, or segment 
pulmonary arteries.  The main, left and right pulmonary arteries 
are normal in caliber, and there is no evidence of right heart 
strain. There is no supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or 
hilar lymphadenopathy. The thyroid gland appears unremarkable. 
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is no 
pleural effusion. Respiratory motion limits evaluation of the 
lung parenchyma.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no 
evidence of pulmonary parenchymal abnormality. The airways are 
patent to the subsegmental level. 
Limited images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. No lytic 
or blastic osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy is 
identified. 
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality.

INTERPRETATION: This ___ yo woman with h/o HLD and family h/o 
premature CAD was referred to the lab from the ED following 
negative 
serial cardiac enzymes for evaluation of chest discomfort. The 
patient 
was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4 minutes. 
There 
were no reports of chest, back, neck, or arm discomforts during 
the 
infusion. At 1 minute of recovery, the patient reported a ___ 
throat/upper chest tightness that resolved completely by 9 
minutes of 
recovery. There were no significant ST changes noted during 
infusion. 
During recovery, 0.___epression was noted in the 
inferolateral leads. These changes resolved back to baseline by 
12 
minutes of recovery. Rhythm was sinus with one VPB in early 
recovery. 
During late recovery, occasional ventricular trigeminy and one 
atrial 
triplet were noted. Mild resting systolic and diastolic 
hypertension 
with an appropriate heart rate and blood pressure response to 
the 
infusion. Post-MIBI, the Persantine was reversed with 125 mg 
Aminophylline IV. 
IMPRESSION: Non-specific EKG changes during recovery in the 
presence of 
atypical symptoms. Nuclear report sent separately. 

___ CARDIAC PERFUSION PHARM
SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  
For pharmacologic stress dipyridamole was infused intravenously 
for 
approximately 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
milligram/kilogram/min. 1 to 2 
minutes after the cessation of infusion, the stress dose of the 
radiotracer was injected.  She had chest tightness and 0.5 mm 
STD after the infusion.   
  
TECHNIQUE:  
ISOTOPE DATA: (___) 10.7 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest; 
(___) 32.4 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress; DRUG DATA: (Non-NM 
admin) Dipyridamole; 
  
IMAGING METHOD:  
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was 
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting 
images.  
Following intravenous infusion of the pharmacologic agent, the 
stress dose of sestamibi was administered intravenously. Stress 
images were obtained 
approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. Following 
resting images and following intravenous infusion,  
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained 
approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection.  
  
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.  
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model.  
  
FINDINGS:  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast 
attenuation. Left ventricular cavity size is normal. Rest and 
stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, moderate reduction 
in photon counts involving the mid anteroseptum, distal anterior 
wall, and the apex. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The 
calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 66% with an EDV 
of 75 ml.  
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the LAD territory. 
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the ___ Cardiology service for chest 
pain. We did a stress test to see how your heart was working, 
and given some abnormality in the test, you had a procedure 
(cardiac catheterization) to look at your heart vessels.

There was no findings of blockage that would lead to a heart 
attack. The stress test may have been a false positive reading. 
Your chest pain may be anxiety or related to heartburn.

Please follow up with your PCP as listed below. 

We wish you the best 
Your ___ Care team
