CTU - IMPRESSION:
1. Moderately severe left-sided hydronephrosis with surrounding 
stranding and
nonobstructing renal calculi.  Overall the findings may reflect 
an UPJ
obstruction.  The surrounding stranding may reflect forniceal 
rupture or
infection.  There is also evidence of mild cystitis.
2. Mild parenchymal opacity in the region of the lingula may 
reflect scarring
but follow-up chest CT in 3 months should be performed.

Renal Scan - IMPRESSION:  Decreased flow and function of the 
left kidney, which performs 28%
of the differential renal function.  There is relatively normal 
washout of the
left kidney following diuretic administration without evidence 
of
intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal activity to suggest urine 
leak.

 
Brief Hospital Course:

for cipro. She was transitioned to ___ for planned 14 day 
course of antibiotics. Of note, she as seen by urology during 
admission, who felt that there was no indication for acute
