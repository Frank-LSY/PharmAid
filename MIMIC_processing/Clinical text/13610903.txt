Brain MRI ___
1. Left superior frontal arteriovenous malformation.  The

establishing the arterial supply and venous drainage pathways. 
2. No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or 
infarction.

Carotid/Cerebral Angio ___
Compacted Arteriovenous malformation located in the left frontal 
central and preri-central area, measuring 3.4 x 2.4 centimeter
