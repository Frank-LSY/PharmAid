Psychiatry is consulted to aid with management and disposition 
planning.
.
About a month ago, Mr. ___ mother reports that he was very 
sedated "like a stone" which the family attributed to his dose 
of aripiprazole. His aripiprazole was then discontinued and he 
was started on lurasidone, which was titrated up to 120 mg daily 
(now at 90mg). His mother also discontinued his haloperidol out 
of concern that he was taking too much medication. At this 
point, the patient began to have "hyperactive" thoughts that 
have made it difficult for him to think and concentrate. He 
states that it feels like a "current of water" is running 
through his brain and that he "can't take it anymore." He has 
difficulty describing the content of his thoughts. He does 
endorse difficulty concentrating, and denies experiencing any 
auditory or visual hallucinations for the past few months. He 
has been sleeping well and has a good appetite. He also denies 
having any suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan.

states, "I think it's not safe for him with his mind like this".
