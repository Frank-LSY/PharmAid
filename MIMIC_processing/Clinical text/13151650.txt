DIAGNOSIS:
 
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
 
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda, 
cKappa, cLambda, ___ ___ antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 
11c, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 23, 33, 34, 38, 45, 56, 64, 117 and 
138.
 
RESULTS:
10-color analysis is used to evaluate for leukemia/lymphoma.
Approximately 68.3% of total acquired events are evaluable 
non-debris events.
The viability of the analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD 
is 96.3%.
CD45-bright, low side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 16.6% 
of total analyzed events.
B cells represent 19.5% of lymphoid gated events.
B cells demonstrate monoclonal kappa light chain restriction. 
They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20. They do not 
express any other characteristic antigens including CD5, CD10, 
CD11c and CD23.
T cells comprise 59.8% of lymphoid gated events and express 
mature lineage antigens (CD3, CD5, CD2 and CD7).
A minor subset (8.5%) of T cells shows dim/variable loss of CD7 
(non-specific finding).
T cells have a CD4:CD8 ratio of 2.1.
There is a population of double-negative (CD4 negative/CD8 
negative) T cells comprising 10.1% of CD3 positive cells which 
is of unclear significance.
CD56 positive, CD3 negative natural killer cells represent 15.7% 
of gated lymphocytes. They co-express CD2, CD7 and CD8 (subset).
No abnormal events are identified in the blast gate.
CD38 gated plasma cells represent 0.2% of total analyzed events. 
By intracytoplasmic light chain analysis they are kappa light 
chain restricted. They are positive for CD45, CD138, CD19 
(majority), CD20 (dim subset), CD117 (dim subset) and negative 
for CD56.
 
INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a B 
cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation. Correlation with 
clinical, morphologic (see separate pathology report ___), 
cytogenetics (see separate cytogenetics report ___) and other 
ancillary findings is recommended. Flow cytometry 
immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal populations due to 
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

___ CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. No evidence of acute abnormality identified within the 
abdomen or pelvis. 
Specifically, no lymphadenopathy or bony lesions identified.
2. For complete description of intrathoracic findings, please 
see dedicated
report of CT chest performed concurrently the same day.

___ CT Chest:
No evidence of adenopathy in the chest.

Brief Hospital Course:
==================
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
==================
___ w/ anemia found to have elevated IgM monoclonal gammopathy 
concerning for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia with elevated 
serum viscosity but no clinical symptoms of hyperviscosity. 

==============
ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# IgM monoclonal Gammopathy
She is suspected to have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,
reassuringly without renal dysfunction, proteinuria,
hypercalcemia, or skeletal lesions. There is concern about her
lightheadedness and dyspnea with exertion as that can be a sign 
of hyperviscosity but her symptoms have been ongoing for years 
and are orthostatic in nature. Reassuringly she has no other 
signs of hyperviscosity on admission (no vision changes, no 
CP/SOB, epistaxis, lightheadedness at rest, or peripheral 
neuropathy). Ophthalmic
exam with small dot-blot hemorrhages in periphery that may be 
associated with hyperviscosity but no notable vessel 
tortuosity/dilation and thus no need for ophthalmic intervention 
currently per ophthalmology. Her serum viscosity on discharge 
was 3.1. CT chest without adenopathy and CT abd/pelvis was still 
pending. She has pending labs including cold agglutinins, 
cryoglobulins, coombs, SPEP and BMBx cytology at time of 
discharge. 

# Normocytic Anemia 
She has been known to have low iron saturation and low-normal
ferritin per her outpatient oncologist, which was confirmed on 
repeat iron studies while inpatient. Waldenstroms tumor 
infiltration in bone marrow can cause cytopenias as could her 
low iron sat. In addition, last colonoscopy was ___ years ago, so 
reasonable to repeat. 

# IBS: Has been managed over past 5+ years with prune and 
benefiber regimen in addition to healthy diet. Continued prunes 
and fiber. 

# Preventative: Aspirin held while inpatient and restarted on 
discharge. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================== 
[] Follow up pending ___ labs, scan, and bone marrow biopsy 
[] Follow up with outpatient oncologist 
[] Repeat CBC at follow up appointment 
[] Consider outpatient colonoscopy once OK by outpatient 
oncologist

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted to the hospital for a workup for your anemia 
and lightheadedness

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- Your blood tests showed a high protein (IgM) level which is 
likely from a type of lymphoma (cancer) called Waldenstroms 
Macroglobulinemia 
- This condition could also explain your anemia (low red blood 
cell counts) and your fatigue
- You also had a CT scan of your body and the final result is 
still pending 
- A bone marrow biopsy was done to confirm this diagnosis and 
help guide treatment moving forward
- You saw the eye doctor while in the hospital that saw some 
findings that could be consistent with Waldenstroms, but nothing 
that would need intervention currently 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
- You should follow up with your outpatient oncologist to 
discuss the bone marrow biopsy results and the next steps moving 
forward with treatment
- You also should follow up with the ophthalmologist (eye 
doctor) as this condition has the ability to affect your vision
- You should also get a colonoscopy once your oncologist says it 
is safe to do so

We wish you the best,
Your ___ care team
