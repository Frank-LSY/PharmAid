Brief Hospital Course:
ADMISSION 
=========
___ F w/ rheumatoid arthritis on cyclosporine, azathioprine, and 
hydroxychloroquine, presenting with fever, epigastric pain and 
elevated transaminases.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Azathioprine Adverse Effect 
# Fever
# Transaminitis
Prior to admission, patient had home T-max of 103, one day of 
night sweats and nasal congestion. During her hospital course, 
she was afebrile, normotensive and non-tachycardic. She had 
recently started azathioprine at her last outpatient 
rheumatology appointment with Dr. ___ on ___ 
and was meant to follow-up with outpatient labs. Her symptoms 
and labs were felt to be consistent with a viral infection 
(EBV,CMV). Azathioprine was held on admission, WBC count 
uptrended and she remained hemodynamically stable with no 
signs/symptoms of infection. She will be written for outpatient 
labs, and is to follow-up with ___ Rheumatology on ___ at 
which time her RA regimen can be discussed. 

# Leukopenia
Suspect this is related to her azathioprine toxicity which 
possibly predisposed her to infection. Improved after holding 
azathioprine. Will discharge her off of azathioprine with plans 
to follow up with repeat labs and rheum follow up as outpatient. 


# Relative ___
She presented with a lymphopenia with relative eosinophilic 
predominance. Her eosinophilia was mild; and absolute eos were 
not elevated above standard range. She has several risk factors 
for helminth infection (international travel, suppression), and 
if differential continues to be abnormal, would recommend 
checking for strongyloides or other parasitic infections endemic 
to ___. 

# Abdominal pain
She presented with abdominal pain that was chronic. CT A/P as 
well as RUQ US was unrevealing for any structural abnormality to 
explain her symptoms. She had a recent EGD ___ that showed an 
irregular z-line but otherwise no concerning features. Abdominal 
pain stable and patient able to tolerate po intake. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Osteoporosis
-Continue alendronate 70 mg weekly

#RA
- Hold azathioprine 50 mg daily
- Cont hydroxychloroquine 200 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Follow-up in 1 week for LFTs and CBC w/ differential
[] Follow-up with ___ Rheumatology re: restarting azathioprine
[] If eosinophilia/transaminitis persists, would check for 
alternative infectious etiologies including strongyloides.
