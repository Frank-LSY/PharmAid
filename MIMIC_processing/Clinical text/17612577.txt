CT Head : **** Preliminary Report****
FINDINGS:  There is a ventricular catheter extending across the 
right parietal lobe into the occipital horn of the right lateral 
ventricle, its tip located in the midline roughly 6 mm 
apparently anterior to the ventricle.  Note is made of bilateral 
heterogeneous subdural fluid collections tracking along the 
convexities.  There does not appear to be the definite shift of 
normally midline structures.  The ventricular size is difficult 
to evaluate given the lack of priors.  The third ventricle is 
somewhat prominent.  The osseous structures appear unremarkable. 
 In widest dimension, the left subdural measures about 8 mm and 
the right measures about 6 mm (2:22). 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Bilateral heterogeneous subdural hematomas as described 
above. 
2.  Ventricular catheter which appears to extend more anteriorly 
than would be ideal. 

C-SPINE FLEX AND EXT ON: Prelim results
degenerative changes in cervical spine, no malalignment in 
flexion or extension views. Not a complete study due to lack of 
view of bottom of C7/T1.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F who sustained fall - railing on stairwell gave way and 
she fell off first step with head hitting bottom hinge of 
doorway behind her.  She reprted LOC <1 min. She was initially 
groggy, but returned to baseline MS without ___.  ___ was 
transported to ___ where ___ and Cspine performed. 
___ showed acute on chronic SDH with Cspine without fracture 
(C5-7 listhesis).  The ___ was loaded with dilantin and 
transported to ___ for further evaluation.

Briefly, Mrs. ___ was admitted for evaluation and imaging of 
her head and C-spine. CT of her head revealed bilateral subdural 
hematomas without shift of midline structures. The xray of the 
C-spine showed no malalignment of structures in flexion or 
extension views, no fractures only degenerative changes. The 
___ denied any pain, numbness or tingling when the ___ J 
collar was removed when acquiring the cervical spine xrays. The 
___ was then switched to a soft cervical collar for 
stabilization of her cervical spine. The ___ neurologic 
status remained at her baseline througout her admission. The 
___ was discharged home with a prescription for Dilantin for 
ten days and with instructions to wear a soft cervical collar 
for 8 weeks until her follow up appointment with Dr. ___. She 
is to get another head CT prior to her follow up visit with Dr. 
___.
