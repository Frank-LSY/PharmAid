Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 
 
You were admitted to the hospital after a Laparoscopic Sigmoid 
Colectomy for surgical management of your diverticulitis. You 
have recovered from this procedure well and you are now ready to 
return home. Samples of tissue were taken and this tissue has 
been sent to the pathology department for analysis. You will 
receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. 
If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact you 
regarding these results they will contact you before this time. 
You have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas and your pain 
is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return 
home to finish your recovery.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patientÂ’s to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office.  
 
If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office 
for advice ___:  
 fever greater than 101.5  
 increasing abdominal distension  
 increasing abdominal pain  
 nausea/vomiting  
 inability to tolerate food or liquids  
 prolonged loose stool  
 extended constipation  
 inability to urinate  
 
Incisions:  
 You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures. These are healing well 
however it is important that you monitor these areas for signs 
and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the 
incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, 
increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at 
the incision, or swelling of the area.  
 You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. 
The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with 
steri-strips (little white adhesive strips), these will fall off 
over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or 
swimming until cleared by the surgical team.  
 
Pain  
 It is expected that you will have pain after surgery and this 
pain will gradually improved over the first week or so you are 
home. You will especially have pain when changing positions and 
with movement. You should continue to take 2 Extra Strength 
Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock and you 
may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every hours for 7 days. 
Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or 
any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. Please take 
Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your 
pain to a point where you can ambulate and preform minor tasks, 
you should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication 
oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take 
with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a 
car if taking narcotic pain medications.  
 
Activity  
 You may feel weak or "washed out" for up to 6 weeks after 
surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 
weeks. You may climb stairs. You may go outside and walk, but 
avoid traveling long distances until you speak with your 
surgical team at your first follow-up visit. Your surgical team 
will clear you for heavier exercise and activity as the observe 
your progress at your follow-up appointment. You should only 
drive a car on your own if you are off narcotic pain medications 
and feel as if your reaction time is back to normal so you can 
react appropriately while driving.  

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual 
activities.

Best wishes, 

Your ___ Colorectal Surgery Team
