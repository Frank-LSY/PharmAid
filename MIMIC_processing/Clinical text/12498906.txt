Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a gallstone in your common bile duct 
(choledocholithiasis) which was obstructing the drainage of your 
bile duct, leading to a build-up of bilirubin in your blood and 
skin which made you itch.  An ERCP was done (GI endoscopy 
procedure) to remove the stone.  You should have your 
gallbladder removed (cholecystectomy) as an outpatient.

Do not take any blood thinners or anti-platelet medications for 
5 days after your ERCP (e.g. no aspirin, Aleve, ibuprofen, 
Motrin, etc.).

We also noted that on your CT scan from ___, you were 
found to have some liver lesions and a large ovarian cyst, both 
of which require follow-up.  We discussed this, and I'm 
providing you and your doctors with that information in a 
letter.
