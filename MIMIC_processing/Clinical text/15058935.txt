ECG
EKG (___):
NSR at 55 bpm, nl axis, PR 116, QRS 102, QTC 428, upsloping ST
elevations V3-V4 (no priors for comparison)

Imaging
CXR ___, ___:
1. There is no evidence of an acute cardiac or pulmonary 
process.

___ ___, ___:
1. There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, a 
large
acute territorial infarction, or an intracranial mass.

___ CT left lower extremity -- IMPRESSION: 2.7 x 1.9 x 3.9 cm 
lobulated hypodensity within the vastus medialis muscle near the 
area marked by a metallic marker.  No rim enhancement.  This may 
represent a phlegmon or early abscess.  MRI with contrast is 
recommended for further evaluation.
RECOMMENDATION(S):  MRI with contrast

___ MRI thigh -- IMPRESSION: Localized muscle edema within the 
left vastus medialis muscle with a central nonenhancing 
component consistent with either myonecrosis, a phlegmon or 
sequelae of prior intervention.  Mild surrounding muscle edema 
and hyper enhancement is consistent with myositis.  No drainable 
fluid collection.  Focal muscle edema seen in a similar 
distribution in the right vastus medialis without the area of 
hypoenhancement consistent with myositis, nonspecific in 
appearance.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with a history of nephrotic syndrome as a child 
(suspected minimal-change disease that resolved), currently with 
no active known medical problems, admitted with rhabdomyolysis. 

We are attributing the rhabdomyolysis to heat, dehydration, 
physical exertion, alcohol use and cocaine use. MRI of left 
thigh shows areas of myonecrosis, but no active infection. 

#Rhabdomyolysis
#Mild transaminitis
#L anterior thigh pain (improving), R posterior thigh numbness 
(resolved)
#Significant alcohol use
#Cocaine use
-Suspect that dehydration, physical activity, cocaine use, and 
alcohol use, all combined to lead to rhabdomyolysis
-His CK improved with IV fluids
-CT L thigh to evaluate for any lesion there given the point
tenderness showed an area of concern (see results section), so 
an MRI was performed which showed muscle inflammation -- 
clinically he did not have an infection, and the imaging 
findings fit better with a pressure injury to that part of the 
leg contributing to his rhabdomyolysis, no further workup or 
treatment was directed to this area 
-Patient was seen by social work spoke with him about his 
substance use, and he is committed to never using cocaine again, 
but it is unclear that he appreciates the gravity of and risks 
of binge drinking.  He was given information to arrange 
outpatient counseling, which should be followed up as an 
outpatient by a primary care physician, to ensure that he has 
made that connection.  He has had many life stressors, from a 
young age, and has current life stressors.  His substance use is 
a form of self-medication, and he could benefit greatly from 
counseling.

#Zoster-like rash, R shoulder, R & L forehead
-The patient's rash did not have a fully classical appearance 
for zoster, however they were close enough that we decided to 
treat empirically
The patient was seen by Dermatology who agreed with this plan
specimens were collected for DFA or herpes zoster virus and 
herpes simplex, however unfortunately they did not have any 
cells so not be run
-HSV 1 and 2 IgG were both negative, IgM is pending
-He had no known immunosuppression, and HIV antibody and viral 
load were negative
There initially was some concern for a rheumatological disease 
(given his history of nephrotic syndrome, see below), so patient 
was seen by Rheumatology, who recommended checking hepatitis A, 
B, and C which were all negative (he should get hepatitis B 
vaccination non-urgently), and lupus anticoagulant, ANCA, ___, 
Sjogren's antibodies, and ESR were all negative
-Given low total protein, Rheumatology recommended checking 
quantitative immunoglobulins, which are normal
-Given the concern for zoster with involvement of the V1 nerve, 
Ophthalmology was consulted and had no concerns
-He was begun on acyclovir IV starting ___, and transitioned 
to oral valacyclovir at the direction of Dermatology on ___, 
and should complete a total 10 day course
-Given multiple dermatomes and that it may have crossed the 
midline, we treated it as potential disseminated zoster

#Prior concern for tickborne illness - testing at outside 
hospital all negative

#Transient hearing loss --see HPI above, the patient complained 
of this prior to admission, and it resolved by the time he 
arrived to ___

# History of nephrotic syndrome:
-Previously treated at ___ with 
prednisone/cellcept, but not on therapy for last ___ years. UA 
without e/o proteinuria.
-outpatient f/u PRN

#Mild thrombocytopenia
-Suspect this was related to hemodilution, and a CBC can be 
checked as an outpatient

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- We are trying to facilitate a primary care appointment. 
Unfortunately this was not completed by discharge as it was 
complicated by lack of insurance. The discharge planning service 
will be calling him. we also recommended that he follow-up with 
a local ___ health ___ as another option.
- At follow-up he should check his liver function tests, CK, and 
CBC to see they have all normalized.
- We also recommended counseling for his substance use.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with muscle breakdown from a variety of

medication, as well as topical antibacterial ointment, you 
improved.  It will be important to follow-up with a primary care 
doctor.

When you see this doctor keys to check on the following tests: 
CK, LFT to make sure they have returned to normal.
