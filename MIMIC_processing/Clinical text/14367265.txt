Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EUS/EGD (___)
EUS was performed using a radial echoendoscope at ___ MHz and 10 
MHz frequency: T staging: An exophytic esophageal mass was noted 
at the lower third of the esophagus at 38 cm from the incisors. 
The EUS examination was limited due to the obstructing 
esophageal lesion - unable to advance beyond the esophageal 
mass. The lesion involved the mucosa, submucosa and the 
muscularis propria. There was evidence of invasion beyond the 
muscularis layer. This was manifest by the presence of 
irregularity of outer muscularis layer margin / pseudopodia 
like tumor extensions were noted beyond the outer muscularis 
margin. This was staged as T 3 by EUS criteria. A lymph node was 
noted at 38cm from the incisors. The lymph node was hypoechoic 
and homogenous in echotexture. The borders were well-defined. No 
central intra-nodal vessels were seen. 

 
History of Present Illness:
___ with history of HTN, HLD referred by PCP to ___ after 
outpt CT scan showed new proximal gastric/esophageal mass with 
necrotic LAD, transferred to ___ for further work up. 

___ of ___, patient began losing weight but she reports that 
this had been intentional by eating healthier and exercising 
more. Around ___, her appetite decreased suddenly and 
she was only eating around "a couple bites per day." Although

that she had lost over 50 lbs. Around this time, she also 
noticed some vague dull epigastric pain and was seen by PA at 
her PCP's office. Per patient's report, RUQ u/s was done, which 
was unrevealing. 

Yesterday, she presented to PCP's office at the urging of her 
boyfriend to further investigate her lack of appetite. Patient 
had labs done, which were all within normal limits. Following 
day, patient had CT abdomen with contrast which revealed a 6.9 x 
3.8 cm soft tissue density mass arising from the proximal 
stomach with extensive lymphadenopathy in the gastrohepatic 
ligament, measuring up to 7.2 x 5.6 cm.

Patient's boyfriend was then called by PCP today and told to 
bring patient to ___. At ___, GI was consulted, 
reviewed the outpt images and felt it was best to transfer 
patient to ___ for further management and possible stenting. 

On transfer, patient's vitals were: Temperature: 97.6 F (36.4 
C). Pulse: 92. Respiratory Rate: 14. Blood-pressure: 143/63. 
Oxygen Saturation: 100%.
 
In the ___, initial vital signs were: Temp: 98.0 HR: 82 BP: 
138/83 Resp: 18 O2 Sat: 99 RA

Physical exam: non-revealing.

GI Endoscopy (___): Reviewed and significant findings noted 
below
A large malignant appearing obstructing mass was found at 38 cm 
from the incisors. The mass was friable and ulcerated, extending 
from 38 cm to 43 cm (GEJ). This was also noted at the cardia on 
retroflexion in the stomach. The EUS examination was limited due 
to the obstructing esophageal lesion - unable to advance beyond 
the esophageal mass. The lesion involved the mucosa, submucosa 
and the muscularis propria. There was evidence of invasion 
beyond the muscularis layer. This was manifest by the presence 
of irregularity of outer muscularis layer margin / pseudopodia 
like tumor extensions were noted beyond the outer muscularis 
margin. This was staged as T 3 by EUS criteria.  A lymph node 
was noted at 38cm from the incisors. The lymph node was 
hypoechoic and homogenous in echotexture. Retroflexion in the 
stomach revealed the esophageal mass extending into the gastric 
cardia. Duodenal mucosal erythema at the junction between the 
duodenal bulb and second part of duodenum, with no ulceration
