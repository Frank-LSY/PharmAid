Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o F w/ HTN, HLD, prior R breast cancer s/p mastectomy and 
radiation transferred from ___ with tremors, vomiting, 
palpitations, tachypnea, found to be in new onset rapid A. fib 
with a lactic acidosis, in the setting of
unintentional caffeine overdose.

# Unintentional caffeine overdose: Patient presented with large 
amount of caffeine overdose, symptoms of tachycardia, tachypnea, 
tremors, and palpitations which resolved prior to discharge. 
Management was symptomatic as she was monitored o telemetry

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented with new onset atrial 
fibrillation with RVR in the setting of caffeine overdose. Of 
note, she did not have a prior diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, 
and this seems to have been provoked by caffeine intoxication. 
However, given the half life of caffeine and her persistence of
atrial fibrillation, this may represent an underlying paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation that has just been uncovered. CHADS VASC 
score is 4 in the setting of her age, sex, and history of HTN, 
however, given that this is provoked atrial fibrillation, she 
may benefit from further monitoring for persistence/recurrence 
of
atrial fibrillation prior to initiation of therapy (specifically 
anticoagulation). TSH WNL. She was started on metoprolol and 
uptitrated to Metop succinate 50mg daily given persistent RVR on 
ambulation. This resolved prior to discharge. Her discharge EKG 
showed afib. We spent significant time discussing with her and 
her family the likelihood she may need anticoagulation and will 
need to follow up with her PCP/Cardiologist for further 
monitoring to consider anticoagulation.

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis: 
Resolved prior to discharge. Patient presented with an elevated 
lactic acidosis, likely secondary to sympathetic stimulation and 
possible hypovolemia due to caffeine diuresis.

# Hypertension: Continued amlodipine 5 mg daily, continued 
enalapril

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home atorvastatin 10 mg daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
- As above will need monitoring and re-evaluation to see if 
anticoagulation is indicated if afib persists. Her use of high 
doses of caffeine could have unmasked underlying paroxysmal 
afib.
- Started on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily
# Contacts/HCP/Surrogate and Communication: ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___

___ were admitted for evaluation of shortness of breath and 
jitteriness after ingestion of too much caffeine. With time, 
your symptoms improved. ___ were also found to have new atrial 
fibrillation which was likely triggered by the caffeine intake. 
For this, ___ will need to discuss with your outpatient 
providers whether ___ will need to take a blood thinner 
medication in order to prevent the risk of stroke. ___ may also 
need further monitoring of your heart and an echocardiogram. 

In the meantime, we started ___ on metoprolol to help control 
your heart rate. Please ensure ___ follow up with your doctor to 
discuss the options for further monitoring and whether 
anticoagulation should be started as we discussed inpatient.

It was a pleasure being part of your care team
