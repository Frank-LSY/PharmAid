Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented to the ___ ED after presumably being 
struck while riding his bicycle. Head CT revealed a small left 
traumatic SAH and he was admitted to ED Obs per TBI pathway. 

#TBI
While in the ED Obs a repeat CT head showed stable left tSAH 
however there was a new right frontal SAH. His neurological exam 
was stable however he did report worsened headache so he was 
admitted to the neurosurgery service for close monitoring. 
Another repeat head CT was completed and was stable. OT 
evaluated the patient and recommended home with outpatient 
cognitive neurology follow-up. He complained of dizziness and 
nausea and vomited x1. He responded well to Zofran. On further 
evaluation his symptoms improved. He reported symptoms 
consistent with post-concussion while using electronics such as 
his cell phone. He was educated on ways to avoid headache and 
nausea triggers and was instructed to gradually return to normal 
activity. He was OOB and tolerating POs on day of discharge. He 
was referred to the ___ clinic for follow-up on discharge and 
expressed understanding of this plan.
