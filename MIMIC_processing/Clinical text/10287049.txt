Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[]Follow up with cardiology regarding recent NSTEMI s/p DES to 
proximal L circumflex. Patient found with 3v disease and may 
benefit from CABG ultimately. 
[]Consider switching amlodipine to ___, or adding on if 
pressures tolerate. Of note, patient has tried lisinopril in the 
past but did not tolerate due to side effects.
[]Follow up HRs. During this admission HRs between 40-60s and 
asymptomatic. For this reason, beta blockade was deferred.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
======================
___ with a Hx of HTN and CAD presented with CP that was 
exertional, described as a substernal pressure, and improved 
with rest. In the emergency department he had an EKG revealing 
for sinus rhythm, ST depressions in V4-6 with TWI in III, AVF as 
well as RBBB (unclear if new) with rising troponin from 0.16 to 
0.25. He was given atorvastatin, ASA, and started on a heparin 
gtt prior to arrival to cath lab. Patient underwent cath with R 
radial access and was found to have 50% ostial L main stenosis, 
90% stenosis of L circumflex, and CTO of RCA. Patient elected to 
receive PCI to L circumflex. He had a DES placed at this lesion 
and he received loading dose of Plavix. The following day the 
patient was continued on aspirin 81 mg, Plavix 75 mg, and 
atorvastatin 80 mg. He was free of chest pain and shortness of 
breath.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#NSTEMI s/p DES to pLCx:
#CAD
Patient presented with a few months history of CP and associated 
DOE. Per the patient, he had experienced two episodes the week 
prior of substernal chest pressure without associated radiating 
symptoms that was provoked by walking ___ blocks and resolved 
with rest after 5 minutes. The day of admission he had 
experienced a similar chest pain that was greater in intensity 
and persisted for 15 minutes even after lying down. In the ED he 
was found to be stable with an EKG revealing for sinus rhythm, 
ST depressions in leads V4-6, TWI in leads III and aVF and a 
RBBB (unclear if new). Patient was found to have a rising 
troponin, from 0.16 to 0.25. He was started on heparin gtt and 
given full dose ASA with a statin. He then underwent cardiac 
catheterization with R radial access. He was found to have 50% 
ostial L main stenosis, 90% stenosis of L circumflex, and CTO of 
RCA. Patient elected to receive PCI to L circumflex. He had a 
DES placed at this lesion and he received loading dose of 
Plavix. The following day patient was free of chest pain and 
without shortness of breath. He was continued on 81 mg ASA, 80 
mg atorvastatin, and 75 mg Plavix. He had a TTE which revealed 
normal biventricular systolic function. Given bradycardia in 
40-60s throughout admission, beta blockade was not given. In 
addition given normotension deferred starting ___ on this 
admission; of note, in the past patient had tried lisinopril, 
but this was discontinued due to side effects. 

#HTN
Patient's blood pressures within normal range throughout 
admission. He was continued on 5 mg amlodipine daily.
