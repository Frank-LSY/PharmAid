Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

 
History of Present Illness:
___ h/o UC s/p total abdominal
colectomy with ileal pouch presenting with diarrhea.

Six days ago he got the flu shot and the next day, he developed
diarrhea and went from having 2 BMs per day to over 10 BMs per
day. Notably, patient has ___ pouch "continent ileostomy"
which he drains himself with a tube twice per day.

He admits mild nausea and vomiting x 1 but denies any recent
fevers, chills, vomiting, chest pain or abdominal pain. 

The day prior to admission he began having abdominal cramping
that continued to worsen so he went to ___ for eval where
CT A/P was performed. This showed [dilated apparent J-pouch in
the pelvis. Collapsed appearing ileostomy loop of the anterior
abdominal wall. An obstruction of its anastomosis with this loop
has to be presumed.]

He was noted to have:

- ___ with Cr of 2.3 
- Na 125
- AST 70, ALT 86
- Lactate 2.0

so he was transferred to ___ for evaluation. 

Initial vital signs here notable for: 98.5  84  125/86  18  98%
RA 

Exam notable for:
GI: Soft, nondistended. Very mildly tender to palpation in
epigastrium; no rebound tenderness or guarding
Ext: Warm, well perfused

Labs were notable for:
- Cr 1.5 (from 2.3 at ___, baseline unknown)

Studies performed include: KUB
IMPRESSION:  
Dilute contrast is seen opacifying nondilated small bowel loops
in the upper abdomen. There is pooling of contrast within a
collection in the lower abdomen/pelvis corresponding to the 
fluid
collection seen on the CT abdomen dated ___. The
right lower quadrant ostomy is denoted by sutures projecting 
over
the right lower hemiabdomen, difficult to evaluate if the
contrast has reached the ostomy on these views, this question 
can
be better answered by repeating a noncontrast CT of the abdomen,
should this make a significant difference to clinical 
management.

CT read from ___:
Conclusion: 
1. Dilated apparent J-pouch in the pelvis. Collapsed appearing
ileostomy loop of the anterior abdominal wall. An obstruction of
its
anastomosis with this loop has to be presumed.
2. Some dilated fluid-filled small bowel loops leading up to 
this
J-pouch. Apparent total colectomy.
3. Incidental small bowel mesenteric lymph nodes. Incidental
uncomplicated gallstone.
4. Left lower lobe wedge-shaped opacity possibly atelectasis or
pneumonia, suggest clinical correlation.
5. Other incidental findings as noted.

Patient was given:
___ 08:14 IVF  NS 1000 mL  
___ 14:17 IVF  LR 1000 mL   

Vitals on transfer: 97.7  91  138/108  16  99% RA 
 
Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports symptoms as above.
Continues to have significant stool output from ostomy every few
hours, watery. Minimal nausea. No blood noted. No history of
previous admission for these symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of UC s/p total 
abdominal colectomy with ileal pouch and HTN, who presented with 
likely post-obstructive diarrhea c/b dehydration and ___. 
Throughout hospitalization, patient received multiple fluid 
boluses to try and replete his dehydration. On repeat imaging on 
___, his obstruction had seemed to have resolved, coinciding 
with improvement in his symptoms and diarrhea. He was able to 
tolerate increased PO intake with improvement in both the 
frequency and consistency of his stools. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# UC s/p total abdominal colectomy 
# Post-obstructive diarrhea
# Partial small bowel obstruction
Presented with several days of diarrhea and increased ostomy 
output following influenza vaccine and starting lisinopril. 
Initial outside hospital CT on ___ was concerning for 
obstruction, but no clear cause/foci could be identified on 
imaging. Gastroenterology recommended conservative treatment and 
infectious evaluation, including C.diff (negative), and stool 
viral and bacterial cultures (both negative), and ova & 
parasite, pending at time of discharge. Given concern for 
partial obstruction, general surgery was consulted and 
recommended repeat imaging, which showed the obstruction had 
resolved, coinciding with improvement in patient's symptoms and 
diarrhea. Surgery recommended outpatient follow-up, and 
gastroenterology agreed that further invasive evaluation, such 
as a scope, was not warranted given the patient's improvement. 
Also on differential was a viral gastroenteritis, however given 
the imaging findings and his improvement, this seemed less 
likely. There was little suspicion the patient's symptoms were 
related to initiation of his lisinopril, despite the temporal 
relationship. However, this was not restarted as discussed 
below. The patient will follow up with colorectal surgery, GI, 
and his PCP for further management. 
[] Patient will need follow-up with a new colorectal surgeon 

# Hypovolemic hyponatremia
# Metabolic acidosis
# ___
Cr initially 2.3, with Na 128 and Bicarb 14 at time of 
presentation. These electrolyte abnormalities were though 
secondary to his profuse diarrhea resulting in dehydration. As 
such, all of these values improved with IV fluid resucitation, 
and remained stable as patient began to tolerate PO intake. On 
___, given the patient continued to have some mild diarrhea 
and very low bicarbonate, he received sodium bicarb, and had an 
appropriate improvement in his labs. BMP stable and ___ had 
resolved at time of discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# HTN
In the setting of patient's new ___, his home lisinopril was 
held. Though there was a very low suspicion that this 
contributed to his diarrhea, given the temporal relation, and to 
avoid any speculation, he was switched to amlodipine 5mg for 
further blood pressure control. 
[] Discharged on 5mg Amlodipine. Patient should have close blood 
pressure monitoring after discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Patient will follow-up with new colorectal surgeon 
[] Discharged on 5mg Amlodipine. Patient should have close blood 
pressure monitoring after discharge, uptitrate as necessary 
[] Recommend repeat BMP at ___ follow up
[] Fecal ova & parasite pending at time of discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___.  

Why did you come to the hospital?  
- You were brought into the hospital due to concerns for 
significant diarrhea leading to complications of dehydration.  

What did you receive in the hospital?  
- While in the hospital you received imaging of your abdomen 
that was concerning for a partial bowel obstruction causing your 
symptoms. We had our gastroenterologists and general surgeons 
come evaluate you as well to see if there was further workup 
that was needed to be done. Our general surgeons recommended 
repeating the imaging, which showed resolution of the 
obstruction, coinciding with improvement of your symptoms. Our 
gastroenterologists did not feel that further intervention or 
evaluation was necessary given the improvement in your symptoms. 
 
- We also provided you with intravenous fluids to help correct 
your dehydration. This seemed to both improve your labs and 
symptoms.    

What should you do once you leave the hospital?  
- Please continue to try and eat and drink normally. 
- We would encourage you to follow-up with the colorectal 
surgeons for further evaluation of your ileal pouch. 
- Please continue to take your new blood pressure medication, 
amlodipine. You should follow-up with your primary care 
physician ___ ___ weeks to monitor its effect on your blood 
pressure.   

We wish you the best!  
Your ___ Care Team
