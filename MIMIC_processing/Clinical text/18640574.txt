History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with 
anxiety presenting with episode of dizziness, unsteady gait, and 
nonsensical speech. 

Ms. ___ reports that this morning she and a friend walked 
to get breakfast. They waited about 30 minutes for their food 
and then brought it to a park to eat. Around 12:30 she started 
to feel strange and dizzy. No room-spinning or light headedness. 
Felt like she was leaning to the right. She got up to "walk it 
off" and kept veering to the right with her gait. Her friend 
noticed this as well. Her friend also noticed that her right eye 
seemed turned inward. They walked home and she had difficulty 
putting her key in the door lock. She thinks this was because 
she was feeling dizzy. She lay down on the couch and thought she 
was feeling better however her friend notes that her speech 
became somewhat slurred and nonsensical. This started about 20 
minutes after the dizziness and unsteady gait. Her friend 
convinced her to come to the ED. Speech changes lasted about 4 
minutes total before return to baseline on route to the ED. 

She denies headache, trauma, recent exercise or MVA. 

Ms. ___ feels that she has not been sleeping as well in the 
past few weeks and is stressed but slept well last night. She 
drinks socially and uses lorazepam as needed for anxiety but 
denies any recent alcohol or drug use. On neurologic review of 
systems, the patient denies headache, lightheadedness, or 
confusion. Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending 
speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, 
vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia. 
Denies focal muscle weakness, numbness, parasthesia. Denies loss

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted due to non-specific symptoms of 
dizziness and visual changes; a stroke workup was initiated. At 
the time of admission, she had returned to her baseline, and she 
remained at her baseline throughout her stay in the hospital. 
She was found to have an acute ischemic stroke and received a 
comprehensive neurovascular evaluation. She was discharged 
without complication in stable condition. 

#Acute Ischemic Stroke 
-Presented with non-specific dizziness and visual symptoms ("eye 
not moving correctly"). She did not receive IV-tPA or mechanical 
thrombectomy. Her initial CT head was negative, but CTA reported 
a diminutive segment of distal M2 that reconstituted. Her MRI 
brain showed a small left thalamic ischemic infarction. TEE was 
performed and was positive for a patent foramen ovale. ___ venous 
dopplers were subsequently performed, and were negative for DVT. 
We scheduled her for an outpatient MRV of the pelvis. We have 
also scheduled her for an appointment with interventional 
cardiology to discuss closing the PFO electively. 
Hypercoagulable workup was sent during her admission as well. 
Daily Aspirin 81 mg was recommended at the time of discharge for 
secondary stroke prevention.

#Patent Foramen Ovale 
-Suspect a relation to her acute ischemic stroke. No DVT 
discovered on ___ dopplers, but MRV pelvis is pending for 
outpatient. Have made an appointment with interventional 
cardiology to consider closure. 

#Anxiety 
-Chronic; stable this admission 
-Home medications were continued without change  

================================

Transitional Issues: 
[] Follow up with PCP, neurology (Atrius), and interventional 
cardiology 
[] Outpatient MRV of the pelvis ordered to look for venous 
sources of emboli as she has PFO; needs to be followed up on 
outpatient. If she does not hear back from them regarding 
scheduling, she can call ___. 
[] The final read of the lower extremity Doppler is pending; 
follow up outpatient 
[] Hypercoagulable workup needs to be followed up on outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
 
 Dear Ms. ___,  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness and visual 
changes resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
During your testing, the only risk factor that we found was a 
small hole in the heart, which we discussed. We recommend 
continuing a healthy diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from 
smoking. 

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
-Start daily Aspirin 81 mg 

You will need to have an MRI of your pelvis done as well on an 
outpatient basis to look for deep clots that could explain the 
etiology of your stroke. 
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed. 
 
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
