___: Skin pathology: 
DERMATOPATHOLOGY REPORT  Final
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
1. Skin, right lower flank; punch biopsy:
- Spongiotic and focally vacuolar interface dermatitis with 
neutrophilic spongiosis, scattered
subcorneal neutrophilic microabscesses, and superficial dermal 
perivascular lymphocytic and
neutrophilic infiltrate (see note).
2. Skin, right upper flank; shave biopsy:
- Predominantly spongiotic dermatitis with prominent 
neutrophilic spongiosis, patchy intracorneal
neutrophilic microabscesses, and superficial perivascular 
lymphocytic infiltrate with admixed
neutrophils (see note).
Note: The predominant pattern of inflammation is spongiotic 
dermatitis modified by neutrophilic
exocytosis and focal mild interface vacuolar degeneration. A 
drug hypersensitivity reaction is
favored. The neutrophilic component may be related to this 
patient's underlying rheumatoid disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for diffuse rash throughout 
your body.  You were evaluated by dermatology who deemed that 
this rash was likely secondary to an adverse reaction to one of 
your home medications most likely Plaquenil.  You were taken off 
of Plaquenil and started on IV steroids, steroid cream and 
antihistamines.  You did well with these interventions and your 
rash appears improved.  You are being discharged home on oral 
steroids, oral antihistamines, and steroid and antihistamine 
creams.  You were advised to no longer take Plaquenil until 
discussing with her outpatient rheumatologist. 

You should follow-up with your primary care physician and 
rheumatologist within 1 to 2 weeks of discharge from the 
hospital.  You should also follow-up with dermatology within 1 
to 2 weeks of discharge from the hospital.
