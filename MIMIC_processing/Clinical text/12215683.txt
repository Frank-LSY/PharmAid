MICRO:
LYME SEROLOGY (Final ___: 
      NO ANTIBODY TO B. BURG___ DETECTED BY EIA. 
      Reference Range:  No antibody detected. 
      Negative results do not rule out B. burg___ infection. 
 Patients
      in early stages of infection or on antibiotic therapy may 
not produce
      detectable levels of antibody.  Patients with clinical 
history and/or
      symptoms suggestive of lyme disease should be retested in 
___ weeks. 

___ 7:42 am Blood (EBV)

                            **FINAL REPORT ___

   ___ VIRUS VCA-IgG AB (Final ___:    POSITIVE 
BY EIA. 

   ___ VIRUS EBNA IgG AB (Final ___:    POSITIVE 
BY EIA. 

   ___ VIRUS VCA-IgM AB (Final ___: 
      NEGATIVE <1:10 BY IFA. 
      INTERPRETATION: RESULTS INDICATIVE OF PAST EBV INFECTION. 
      In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at 
sometime
      with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA 
antibodies.
      Antibodies to EBNA develop ___ weeks after primary 
infection and
      remain present for life. Presence of VCA IgM antibodies 
indicates
      recent primary infection. 

CXR:
No acute process
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of afib presenting with intermittent fevers x2 
weeks, with recent tick exposure, concerning for tick borne 
illness.

# Intermittent fevers, concern for tick borne infection.
The patient presented with fevers which transiently resolved, 
___ then recurred. Tick exposure and associated elevation in 
LFTs and thrombocytopenia make tick borne infection a possible 
source of fevers. The patient was seen but he infectious disease 
service who recommended empiric doxycycline. The patient had 
blood cultures and a urine culture which was negative. His CXR 
was without pneumonia. Lyme serology was negative. EBV serology 
was also negative for acute infection. HIV was negative a viral 
load was not sent as the patient denied high risk behaviors. A 
number of studies including anaplasma, bebesia PCR, CMV IGG and 
mono spot are pending on discharge. The patient improved 
symptomatically prior to discharge. He will need close PCP 
follow up and consideration of additional work up for 
non-infectious causes FUO if his fever persists and infectious 
work up is negative.

# Thrombocytopenia: 
Platelets decreased to 51 after admission after improving to 
>100 as an outpatient. This is likely to infections process. 
Thepatient was given a lab slip for repeat labs on ___.

# Elevated LFTs: Hepatocellular pattern of injury, previously 
WNL in ___ and prior. As above, suspect this reflects above 
infectious process, although cannot rule out chronically 
elevated LFTs from other, chronic causes of hepatitis. If remain 
elevated on follow up, would send hepatitis serologies.

# Hyponatremia: 
Presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia which improved with 
fluids. 

# Afib: 
Continued home metoprolol, stall and rivaroxiban

Transitional issues:
- Babesia, anaplasma, CMV serologes, inaddition to blood 
cultures are pending on discharge
- Follow up labs on ___ (LFTs and CBC) with results to PCP

2. Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID 
3. Rivaroxaban 20 mg PO DAILY

have a number of laboratory tests pending on discharge. You will 
be discharged home on Doxycycline for 14 days.
