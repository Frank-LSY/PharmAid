History of Present Illness:
 ___ yo man current long time smoker without PMHx (has not seen a 
doctor in 30+ years) not taking any medications, presents as 
transfer from OSH with painless hematuria for 1 month.  
 Brought to ED at ___ by his daughter who lives in 
___ where they did labs that showed H&H 3.___, got 2 units 
PRBCs. At ___ a CT was performed which showed an ill 
defined soft tissue density in bladder which could represent 
clot or malignancy as well as ill defined hypodensity within the 
tail of the pancreas which may represent IPMN vs other neoplasm. 
Lastly, age indeterminate splenic infarcts measuring aprox 30% 
of splenic parenchyma.  
 The patient only complains of right hip pain intermittently 
with leg numbness/tingling, fatigue, mild dyspnea, and pain when 
passing urinary clots sometimes with difficulty urinating. 
Otherwise is not in any pain.  
 In further discussion he first noted gross hematuria ___ years 
ago. He states it was explicitly associated with exertion 
(lifting or moving heavy objects; not exercise per se). He would 
have gross hematuria for about 1 week with associated small 
clots and some dysuria w/clot passage. Otherwise asymptomatic. 1 
month ago he recalls moving a boat lift and the next day had the 
same onset of usual hematuria. However it has not resolved 
since. He subsequently developed some shortness of breath which 
prompted his presentation to ___.  
 He ___ chest pain, endorses "feeling his heart beat" and 
dyspnea only as of late. Denies abdominal pain, increased 
satiety, changes in bowel habits. Denies changes in vision, 
headaches, dizziness and vertigo. No urinary or fecal 
incontinence or back pain. He does endorse mild right hip pain 
which is worse with use and has some associated radiculopathy to 
the heel unchanged on the order of months to year.

REPORTS
================
OSH CT Ab/Pelv ___
 - ill defined soft tissue density in bladder which may 
represents clot but mass cannot be excluded  
 - ill defines hypodensity within the tail of the pancreas which 
may represent IPMN vs other neoplasm  
 - age indeterminate splenic infarcts measuring aprox 30% of 
splenic parenchyma.  

RUQUS ___
Diffusely echogenic hepatic architecture consistent with 
steatosis.  
Innumerable regions of hypoechogenicity, some due to focal fatty 
sparing, but also including several round regions measuring up 
to 1.2 cm in the liver raising the concern for metastatic 
disease.  An MRI is recommended for further evaluation. 

GU-US ___
Large heterogeneous echogenic mass within the bladder concerning 
for 
malignancy.

MRCP ___ Mild dilatation and peribiliary enhancement of the central 
intrahepatic 
ducts, as well as dilatation of peripheral biliary radicles in 
segments II and V. Patchy areas of altered perfusion of the 
hepatic parenchyma.  Several small nonenhancing versus 
hypoenhancing foci in the hepatic dome and segment V, measuring 
up to 1 cm, noting that enhancement characteristics are 
difficult to assess secondary to small size. This constellation 
of findings is most concerning for cholangitis with 
microabscesses.  Small metastases are felt less likely, but not 
completely excluded.  Follow-up exam after appropriate treatment 
is recommended.  There is mild circumferential gallbladder wall 
edema, may be reactive or from third-spacing, is new since prior 
exam.  Acute cholecystitis is less likely, cannot be excluded, 
clinically correlate.  Dilated common bile duct, measures 1.1 
cm, without stones. 
2) 5.4 x 2.8 cm mass in the pancreatic tail with progressive 
peripheral 
enhancement and central necrosis, concerning for pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma. 

EUS ___
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz 
frequency: 
The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the duodenal 
bulb and the second / third duodenum. 
The body and tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body 
and fundus. 
A focused EUS was performed. 
___: 
___ 3.2 cm X 1.7 cm ill-defined mass was noted in the tail 
of the pancreas. 
___ mass was hypoechoic and heterogenous in echotexture. 
___ borders of the mass were irregular and poorly 
defined. 
___ was performed of the pancreatic mass. 
___ doppler was used to determine an avascular path for 
needle aspiration. 
___ Covidien 22-gauge Sharkcore fine needle biospy system 
with a stylet was used to perform aspiration.
___ Five needle passes were made into the mass 
Otherwise normal EUS to third part of the duodenum

US-guided Liver Biopsy ___
Uncomplicated 18-gauge targeted liver biopsy x 3 of the 
suspicious solid 
segment 5 lesion, with specimen sent to pathology.  No drainable 
fluid 
collections were identified

who presents from ___ for fatigue, 
hematuria, and significant anemia. Found to have large bladder 
mass, pancreatic mass, and multiple liver lesions on imaging.

# Hematuria
# Acute blood loss anemia
# Urothelial bladder cancer
He has had ___ year of hematuria intermittently, but recently 
with an increase in gross hematuria. More recently, he had been 
feeling fatigued.  Presented to OSH were ill-defined bladder 
mass was seen on OSH CT, confirmed on ___ US, so he went to 
the OR for cystoscopy, clot evacuation, bladder tumor resection, 
and fulgeration on ___ with Urology at ___.  Presenting Hgb 
3.2, 6.5 after 4U PRBC, 7.8 after one further unit, and was 
stable thereafter.  Iron studies were consistent with deficiency 
(low ferritin, high TIBC), hemolysis labs don't point to this as 
etiology of anemia.  Pathology came back consistent with low 
grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, no evidence of 
invasion on path report. Will need repeat cystoscopy in 3 
months.  Also started daily PO Iron, with Colace.

# Pancreatic Mass:  Initially noted as incidental finding on OSH 
CT imaging of abdomen. MRCP here confirmed this finding, showing 
a lesion consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Of note, 
has a family history of multiple family members with breast 
cancer (one w/early onset) which could raise suspicion for BRCA 
mutation, which is associated with pancreatic cancer.  Underwent 
EUS with FNA of panc mass on ___, biopsy results to be 
followed up as outpatient.  Ca ___ was high, raising concern 
for cancer.  The Pancreatic ___ was emailed 
prior to discharge, and will contact pt for follow-up once 
pathology is finalized.

# Hepatic lesions
# Transaminitis
Mildly elevated transaminases, mod elevation in Alk phos and 
T-bili, elevated GGT. RUQUS and MRCP both showed numerous small 
hepatic lesions.  The US favored metastases as etiology, whereas 
MRCP suggested that this could be cholangitis with microabscess. 
 Obstruction due to mass/stones feels less likely.  Hep B/C, HIV 
negative.  Clinically, he did not appear to be infected, as he 
was consistently afebrile, nonseptic appearing, and with 
negative cultures.  He was briefly on Unasyn ___, but 
this was discontinued.  Underwent ___ biopsy on ___, and 
there was no drainable fluid collection, making abscess 
unlikely.  Pathology sent, to be followed up as outpatient.

# Leukocytosis: WBC to 17.3 the day after cystoscopy, likely 
reactive post-cysto.  Afebrile and hemodynamically stable with 
negative cultures throughout stay.  Downtrended from 17 to 11 
the next day without antibiotics, and continued to downtrend 
throughout hospital stay.  Low concern for infection.

# Splenic Infarcts: OSH CT raises question of "age indeterminate 
splenic infarcts measuring aprox 30% of splenic parenchyma," 
again noted on MRCP here.  Consider embolic phenomenon, 
malignancy, infiltrative process, or hypercoaguable state.  
Malignancy feels most likely given total clinical picture.  No 
A-Fib noted.  No infectious symptoms or prodrome to suspect 
infective endocarditis.

# Health maintenance: Given low interaction with health care 
system, obtained some basic screening tests to help ease his 
transition back into health care.  Lipid panel without 
hyperlipidemia, HIV/RPR negative, Hep C negative, A1C 5.4%.  
Deferred other screening to outpatient setting. Off note will 
likely need CT chest at some point for lung cancer screening 
given smoking history.

# Hep B non-immune:  vaccinated ___ in house, will need to 
complete series as outpatient
- Dose ___ at 1-month: due ___ or later
- Dose ___ at 6-months: due ___ or later

# Proteinuria: Noted on urine studies. Likely simply due to GU 
bleeding. BUN/Cr normal.  A1C 5.0%.
- Outpatient follow-up

# Nicotine Dependence  
- 21mcg patch given

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted 
because of low blood counts and bleeding.  You were given blood 
transfusions and your counts improved.  You underwent a 
procedure with the Urologists, and a bladder tumor was removed.  
This turned out to be a type of bladder cancer, but it appears 
that it was completely resected based on the pathology report.  
You should see a Urologist, either at ___ or closer to home, 
in 3 months for another Cystoscopy.

You were also found to have a mass in the pancreas, and lesions 
in your liver.  Biopsies were taken of these.  Our concern, as 
you know, is that this is cancer, although nothing is for sure 
until the biopsy results come back.  We will call you with these 
results.  You should follow up at ___ in the Pancreatic Tumor 
Clinic next week to discuss this, and we will call you with that 
appointment.

It was a pleasure caring for you, we wish you the best,
___ Medicine Team
 
Followup Instructions:
