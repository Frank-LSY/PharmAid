Brief Hospital Course:
1)Psychiatric
The patient presented appearing very flat, depressed, and 
psychomotor delayed.  After her first ECT, she began to smile 
and her affect was less restricted. She expressed wishes to 
complete ECT as an outpatient.  Due to her multiple medical 
problems, including seizure disorder and arterial-venous 
malformation, it was determined the patient should be monitored 
for at least 3 ECT treatments prior to completing ECT as an 
outpatient.  The patient tolerated her first ECT treatments 
well.  She had minimal confusion after treatments.  Ocassionally 
she had headaches and muscle aches which responded well to pain 
medications (ibuprofen, acetominophen, and torodol).  The 
patient particiapted in individual, group, milieu therapy.  Dr. 
___ Dr. ___ agreeable with the patient 
receiving ECT as an outpatient.  The patient agreed to not drive 
until 2 weeks after her last ECT treatment.  She was told that 
she should not make any major decision while recieving ECT.  She 
agreed to be under supervision until supper time on days of ECT. 
 She also understood that she should not eat or drink after 
midnight on nights prior to ECT and days prior to ECT.  

Most of the patient's outpatient medications were continued 
during this hospitalization.  Klonopin and Depakote had been 
discontinued prior to admission to help the patient have 
seizures.  Her Zonegran was continued, per neurology request, 
during this hospitalization but given after ECT treatments (the 
patient's neurologist was consulted and agreed with this plan). 
Risperdal was discontinued given that the patient reported that 
she did not find it helpful.  At discharge the patient appears 
safe and appropriate to recieve ECT as an outpatient.  No signs 
or symptoms of mania noted.
.
2)Medical-
The medical team and the anesthesiology service were consulted 
to clear the patient for ECT.  Pulmonology sleep disorder 
clinician was also consulted given the patient's history of 
obstructive sleep apnea.  The sleep order clinician stated that 
the patient should be encouraged to wear the CPAP but that if 
she refused it was not a contra-indication to ECT.  The patient 
was medically cleared to participate in ECT.  During the course 
of ECT, she tried to use the CPAP machine but often took it off 
because it felt uncomfortable.  She refused to have a CPAP 
mahcine sent home with her stating that she would not use it and 
that it would likely get full of cat hair.  She refused to 
follow up with a sleep disorder specialist after discharge.  
There were no other active medical issues during this 
hospitalization.
.
3)Legal- The patient signed in on a conditional voluntary basis.
