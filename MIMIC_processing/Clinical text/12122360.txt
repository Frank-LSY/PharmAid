History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with no formal past psychiatric history,
but likely hx of depression, SIB (cutting), self-presenting with
SI and plan in the context of multiple psychosocial stressors.
Psychiatry was consulted for safety evaluation.

On interview, patient is noted to be quite dysphoric, downcast,
and slow in speech. She reports a series of difficult
psychosocial stressors over the past 6 months. In ___ she
moved to ___ "out of necessity" due to her parents starting 
to
physically abuse her again (from both parents, though
predominantly father). She left her home and was able to move in
with a good friend in ___. However they subsequently had a
falling out, and she ultimately ended up homeless in ___
for about 1 mo, and another half a month couch surfing in
___. She states this time was extremely traumatic for her.
After that she moved into an unheated attic in a co-op, which 
she
pays for with her current job. However state the attic now also
has no electricity. She says she already wasn't doing that well
mentally living in the attic, but it was "manageable." However
then 3 weeks ago she reports she was essentially sexually
assaulted by a friend while drunk (not entirely consensual), and
since then "just can't handle it anymore." Additionally, her
former friend she had lived with told her to stop contacting 
him,
as she admits she "crossed the line" and asked him for too much
support. She now feels like she doesn't have anybody for 
support.

She has been having suicidal thoughts for about 7 months, which
she says were "manageable," and she knew she wouldn't act on
them, however but in the past few weeks got worse - and now
reports "I've given in." She currently sees "no way out, there 
is
nowhere to run, nowhere to recover." Today she planned to go 
home
and "take a bunch of pills and ___ it with vodka." However she
notes there was a part of her that didn't want to do that, as 
she
came to the hospital instead. She stated she was "probably" 
going
to do it. She has almost overdosed multiple times over the past
few months (at  least 20x) - taking the pills into her hands, 
and
was stopped by "fear." Was not able to bring to mind anyone or
anything worth living for.

Endorses multiple vegetative sx of depression including low
energy - feels very depleted, significant anhedonia, and some
sleep disturbance. Has mostly preserved appetite. Has been 
having
vivid nightmares about trauma. Used to have flashbacks, but now
just lots of intrusive thoughts. Says it is very difficult for
her to feel safe anywhere public, as she is always hypervigilant
and "very scared of everything." Reports anxiety episodes
consisting of SOB, extreme anxiety, heart racing, palms 
sweating,
lasting a few minutes, and occurring at least a few times a 
week.
She also has been cutting, though not for the past few weeks. 
She
does this when she get overwhelmed. Has considered slitting her
wrists in SA as well, but has never cut with intention of
suicide. Denies manic or psychotic sx, aside from
paranoia described above. She feels she "really needs help" and
is agreeable to inpatient hospitalization.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) MDD vs Adjustment disorder with depressed mood 
Patient has many psychosocial stressors including being recently 
homeless, now living in an unheated attic in a house with 8 
other people, few to no strong social supports, a full time job 
which she is afraid she might be fired from if her employers 
knew how she was feeling, no health insurance or outpatient 
providers, no outside financial support and a recent sexual 
assault.  She reported symptoms of depression such as low mood, 
low energy, lack of interest in activities and poor sleep.  She 
believed her depression was made worse by her current living 
situation and resent assault.  She had been thinking about 
overdosing on Zoloft for a while but the night she came to the 
ED she felt she couldn't keep herself safe and not overdose.  On 
interview, she was very insightful and articulate and a very 
good advocate for what sort of help would be most useful to her. 
 She was interested in trying a different antidepressant as she 
didn't think the Zoloft 200 mg that she had been taking for a 
few months was helpful.  She was agreeable to trying Paxil given 
her recent anxiety and PTSD symptoms following her assault.  It 
was started at 10 mg and increased to 30mg qD with no side 
effects noted. She was started on methylphenidate 5mg BID (she 
had been on this drug before) to aid with concentration.  She 
also had done CBT/seen a therapist before while in ___ and was 
very interested in working with a therapist in ___.  She also 
requested therapy specific for trauma as she has found her 
recent and past trauma to make coping with her current situation 
very difficult.  ___ domestic violence team was consulted 
for further assistance and will be in contact with the patient 
upon discharge to offer services.  Follow up with out patient 
providers was arranged including an NP to function as a primary 
care provider and to refer her to psychiatry follow up, as 
insurance (___) was pending for her. Upon discharge she 
was discharged with a 2 week supply of medicines via a free 
pharmacy program as her public health insurance was pending. 

#) PTSD
Patient reports a history of abuse from her parents, physical 
and verbal.  She also was sexually assaulted about three weeks 
ago while drinking with some friends.  Since that event, she has 
been hypervigilant, afraid to go out on her own, nightmares, 
flashbacks and anxiety.  Paxil was selected as an antidepressant 
to hopefully help with PTSD and anxiety symptoms.  Patient would 
likely benefit from further outpatient therapy focused on 
trauma.    

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Denies illicit substance use.  Does drink occasionally, 
mostly socially but does not see her drinking as a problem.  
Recently has not been drinking after assault.

alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's
