Per patient's family, in the afternoon of ___ patient started
feeling weaker.  The family was at a retreat in ___ and
she decided to head back to the hotel room early.  That evening
she no longer could recognize her daughter or granddaughter and
was confused, attempting to find doors to get out of the hotel
room.  That night she frequently went back and forth to the
bathroom to urinate.  At another point she has been found
splashing toilet water at her vaginal area stating that she was
"cleaning" herself.  In the context of these symptoms she also
developed a facial droop and the family went to ___ 
___
where labs, imaging, and urine studies were all negative. 
Patient was found to be back at baseline, then was sent back to
the hotel.  The patient then developed recurrence of her 
symptoms
with visual hallucinations, agitation, and restlessness.  In the
morning of ___ she was trying to go to work at ___ to clean the floors.  Family denies fevers, nausea,

further neurologic workup given lack of MRI availability at
___ for the next ___ hours.

intact, with possible left nasolabial fold flattening.  Labs 
were

IMAGING:
==========

OSH IMAGING:
___ ___
Ventricles are not dilated. No midline shift. No acute
intraventricular or intracerebral bleed. No extra-axial
collection. No effacement of sulci or gyri. Periventricular 
white
matter changes consistent with small vessel disease and tiny
bilateral basal ganglia lacune's all unchanged from the prior

___ CXR
Heart size top normal. Tortuous thoracic aorta no change
Lungs show dependent markings posteriorly but no definite 
consolidation. No pleural fluid or pneumothorax
 
IMPRESSION: Compared to the prior exam no acute change. No acute

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with dementia and HTN 
presenting with altered mental status likely ___ UTI.

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============
#Toxic metabolic Ecephalopathy ___ UTI
Patient with AMS that developed acutely in the last 48 hours. 
Story per family appearing consistent with UTI given urinary 
frequency, potential for dysuria with attempts to clean.  UA at 
___ not overtly consistent with UTI, but still with 
trace bacteria.  Neurology evaluated the patient and believe 
this is consistent with metabolic process in the setting of poor 
substrate rather than stroke. Patient empirically treated with 
ceftriaxone 1g q24. Ecephalopathy improved and patient returned 
to baseline. Avoided deliriogenic agents. 

#Urinary tract infection 
Patient with increased urinary frequency at home. UA showing 
moderate leuks, few bacteria, 7 WBCs. 
Patient empirically treatedf with ceftriaxone which was 
transitioned to TMP-SMX for discharge. 

#HTN
Patient hypertensive to SBP up to 200's occurring in the setting 
of agitation which improved with intitiation of home atenolol. 
Her blood pressures remained elevated with SBP in 160s. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#CKD III (baseline Cr ~ 1.3)
Patient at baseline.  Continued to monitor Cr and avoid 
nephrotoxic agents as able.

#GLAUCOMA
Continued brimonidine, latanoprost, and dorzolamide eye drops

#DEMENTIA C/B PARANOIA
Continued home perphenazine. 

#GERD
Omeprazole 20 mg BID at home, unclear as to why twice daily 
dosing. This was reduced to daily dosing for discharge with 
transitional issue to re-address with PCP. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Patient on omeprazole 20mg BID ER at home, unclear as to why 
she is on BID dosing. This was reduced to once daily and should 
be discussed with PCP.
