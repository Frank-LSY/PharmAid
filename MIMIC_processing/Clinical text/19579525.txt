Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at the ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
removal of your abdominal mass. You tolerated the 
procedure well and have recovered well from some mild 
post-operative issues, that resolved prior to your discharge. 
You are now ambulating, stooling, tolerating a regular diet, and 

your pain is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are 
now ready to be discharged to home. Please follow the 
recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 

otherwise.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 

such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 

to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
