History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ yo woman with medical history significant for
T9-12 spinal tumor resection in ___ who presents to the ED with 


low back pain and saddle anesthesia with associated new RT lower
extremity paresthesias. She visited her PCPs office today with
complaints of urinary and fecal incontinence. PCP suggested she
went to the ER but she refused, only to present later in the
evening. The patient reports her symptoms started since 2 weeks
ago with urinary incontinence, then fecal incontinence. She also
noticed RT thigh numbness which is intermittent. These symptoms
are associated with low back pain that radiated to the left
buttock. Of note she has baseline LT lower extremity weakness 
and
sensory loss.

In the ED her rectal tone was examined and found present. Code
cord was called and her spine was imaged with MRI which showed
expected post op changes and possible syrinx. Neurosurgery was
consulted and determined no acute intervention. Patient was to 
be
admitted to the medicine service but neurology consult was
requested for further w/u.     
 
On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache,
lightheadedness, or confusion. Denies difficulty with producing
or comprehending speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or
dysphagia.  

On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, rigors,

MRI total spine
1. Focal short segment high signal within the left lateral 
spinal cord at the 
level of T12 with no definite associated contrast enhancement, 
although the 
postcontrast sequences are limited by motion artifact.  Given 
the history of 
the spinal cord tumor, this may represent sequelae of prior 
treatment, 
particularly given focal kyphosis of the thoracolumbar spine at 
this level.  
Recommend correlation with prior imaging. 
2. Mild degenerative changes throughout the spine with no 
significant spinal 
canal or neural foraminal stenosis. 
3. No evidence for cord compression. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with a PMHx of T9-T12 "benign" 
(per chart) spinal tumor resection ___, with residual left leg 
plegia and loss of sensation in the left leg and left saddle 
region) who presented with back pain, right leg cramping, and 
urinary incontinence. A code cord was called, and Her MRI total 
spine showed post-surgical changes; there was no new pathology. 
She was evaluated by neurosurgery, and they felt that there was 
no need for surgical intervention. Upon questioning, it turns 
out that her saddle anesthesia is left-sided only and chronic 
since her thoracic spine surgery. The remainder of her exam was 
also notable for chronic findings. Additionally, her urinary 
symptoms, per chart review, are not new. We treated her with 
baclofen, ibuprofen, and Tylenol for her back pain, which was 
likely due to muscle spasms; she was discharged on baclofen. She 
was put on strict Is/Os, and she had one episode of 
incontinence. She was scheduled for an appointment to follow-up 
with urology for a urodynamic study for urinary incontinence. We 
also spoke with her primary care provider, who referred the 
patient to pain clinic/spine clinic. Physical therapy 
recommended outpatient ___, and she was discharged with a script 
for this. Our hospital social worker referred her to her clinic 
social work for help with housing.

Key information/transitional issues:
-Admitted for back pain, right leg cramping, urinary 
incontinence
-MRI total-spine reassuring; post-surgical changes only
-Back muscle spasms; discharged with baclofen
-Follow-up with SW for housing
-Follow-up with urology for urodynamic testing
-Follow-up in pain/spine clinic
