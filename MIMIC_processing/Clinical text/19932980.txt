History of Present Illness:
For further details of the history and presentation, please see 
___ including Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ 
___ initial consultation note dated ___ ___s Dr. 
___ admission note dated ___.
. 
Briefly, this is a ___ year old single Caucasian woman with 
___ level education, currently retired, reportedly 
diagnosed with depression with psychotic features s/p one prior 
psychiatric hospitalization ___ years ago, no prior suicide 
attempts, medical history significant for congenital glaucoma 
s/p left eye removal, cerebral aneurysm, cataracts, who self 
presented to ___ with
concerns for ongoing hair loss and occipital neuralgia. 
. 
ED Course: patient was in excellent behavioral control and did 
not require physical or chemical restraints. 
. 
Patient seen with Dr. ___, PGY-2 and ___, 
___; of note, she was able to provide a clear and coherent 
history although tended to derail at times. Ms. ___ reported 
that she had "noticed for a few months that I wasn't planning 
trips and I traced this back to last ___ when I walked into
a tree and jolted my neck." Patient noted that after this, she 
began to suffer headaches over time and told her PCP, "who told 
me that pain doesn't radiate from the neck to the head." Patient 
reported she felt her PCP was not listening to her, and that her 
PCP prescribed ___ for her head and neck pain, which has not been 
helpful. Ms. ___ reported she had received a neurological 
workup at ___, which showed a small aneurysm, and she states she 
was diagnosed by a neurosurgeon there with occipital neuralgia. 
She reports neuro recommended she start amitriptyline or have a 
local shot to alleviate the pain, "but I'm not ready for that." 
. 
Patient went on to state that it is "hard to function with the 
head pain-- I'm worried because no one seems to be addressing 
it." States that she recently found out she also needs another 
surgery on her remaining eye, but states, "I don't feel like I 
need it yet." Interestingly, patient recalled a similar incident 
approximately ___ years ago when she began to suffer from 
headaches and dizziness. She states that because of these 
symptoms, she elected to have cataract surgery, also she states 
she realizes now that the headaches and dizziness were 
completely unrelated to the cataracts. Patient reported that 
after her cataract removal ___ years ago, she found that her 
"pupil was stretched and did not go back into place-- my vision 
wasn't as clear and it was distorted... my doctors told ___ I was 
fine, but I started to conflate my story as a child and then I 
couldn't function." Reports that she was subsequently 
hospitalized at ___ and put on Zyprexa and Prozac. Reports 
significant weight
gain on the Zyprexa and is unclear if the Prozac was helpful. 
. 
At this time, patient reports that she relates the head pain to 
an "obsession that my hair is falling out." States she had been 
"diagnosing myself" with medical conditions that can cause 
painful hair loss. She had recently seen a hair loss specialist, 
who recommended Rogaine, which she had been applying daily at 
home. She notes spending an excessive amount of time at home 
looking in the mirror to monitor her hair loss. Of note, patient 
recently discontinued the Rogaine, and states that since this, 
"my hair feels different... it's not as heavy... I'm worried I'm 
not going to recover the hair loss." 
. 
Patient noted that she tends to be anxious and obsessive, but 
states that since she retired ___ years ago, "I don't have enough 
to do." Reports she is involved at ___ Lifelong 
___ and continues to be involved in book clubs, but that 
this is not enough. Admits that she feels that being preoccupied 
with her hair and headache "helps me back away from the 
possibility there is something wrong with my eye." 
. 
Patient denies frank depression, stating she is frankly more 
anxious and obsessive than depressed. However, did admit to "not 
being happy here... it's not a happy place." Reported difficulty 
sleeping at night, stating she experiences "pins and needles up 
and down my arm." Reported energy was "okay," denied 
difficulties with appetite or changes in weight. Denies SI or 
thoughts of self harm. 
. 
On psychiatric review of systems, patient denied history of 
manic symptoms including decreased need for sleep, increased 
impulsivity, excessive energy, grandiosity. Denies history of 
psychosis including auditory or visual hallucinations, ideas of 
reference, thought insertion/thought broadcasting. Anxiety as 
noted above. Denies compulsions including excessive washing, 
checking, rituals, etc. Denied drug or alcohol use.  
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old single Caucasian woman with ___ level 
education, currently retired, reportedly diagnosed with 
depression with psychotic features s/p one prior psychiatric 
hospitalization ___ years ago, no prior suicide attempts, medical 
history significant for congenital glaucoma s/p left eye 
removal, cerebral aneurysm, cataracts, who self presented to 
___ with concerns for ongoing hair loss and occipital 
neuralgia.
. 
Interview with patient reveals a longstanding history of 
anxiety/obsessions in the setting of childhood glaucoma 
resulting in losing her left eye with recent worsening of mood, 
anxiety, obsessions beginning in ___ with significant 
rumination regarding her neck pain, hair loss, and eye in the 
setting of limited structure at home and recent recommendation 
for patient to have eye surgery. Mental status examination 
notable for well groomed woman who is quite pleasant, anxious on 
examination, with denial of significantly depressed mood, and 
with thought process that is linear, goal and future oriented. 
Of note, nothing to suggest psychosis on my examination-- 
although she is quite obsessive regarding her hair, neck pain, 
and other somatic symptoms, she also demonstrates good insight 
into this and is able to reality test. 
. 
Diagnostically, patient certainly meets criteria for an anxiety 
disorder with features of obsessive compulsive disorder 
(frequently checking for hair loss). There also does seem to be 
a mood component to her presentation, but I do not believe she 
meets criteria for a major depressive episode, particularly 
given her denial of persistently depressed mood and lack of 
dysthymic/dysphoric affect. Nothing in her history to suggest 
prior manic episode that would be consistent with bipolar 
disorder. Patient is in good health and medical workup was 
unremarkable; in addition, no history of substance use; I do not 
think that an underlying medical condition or substance use is 
contributing to her current presentation. 
. 
#. Legal/Safety: Upon admission, patient signed a CV, which was 
accepted. However, as patient stated she no longer wanted to be 
on an inpatient unit, she also signed a 3 day notice that 
expired on ___. Given her excellent behavioral control on 
the unit with consistent denial of suicidal ideation or thoughts 
of self harm with thought process that was notably linear, 
logical, goal and future oriented, with good attendance to 
ADL's, she did not meet criteria to file a 7&8b. Of note, she 
did not require physical or chemical restraints during her 
hospitalization. 
.  
#. Unspecified anxiety disorder: as above 
- Patient was compliant in attending groups and with meeting 
with her treatment team and participated appropriately in her 
care. 
- ___ workup including B12, RPR, and TSH was unremarkable. 
- Discussed the risks and benefits of initiating Cymbalta and 
the patient was intermittently compliant with this medication. 
However, after further discussion, patient stated she strongly 
preferred not to take an antidepressant at this time and 
declined initiation of low dose risperidone, stating she would 
prefer to utilize therapy instead, which was reasonable. 
However, during her hospitalization she did utilize low dose 
Ativan 0.5 mg, which she felt was helpful for her sleep. 
- Patient did report she found the hospitalization to be 
somewhat helpful and was able to discuss her lifelong struggle 
with anxiety, depression, and obsessive ruminations. She 
demonstrated good insight that these symptoms seemed to stem 
from a chaotic childhood as noted in the HPI and was able to 
verbalize that ultimately she was afraid of "losing my mind like 
my mother did." She was motivated to continue outpatient therapy 
and a partial program for additional structure and support.  
. 
#. Headache: as noted above 
- Patient will follow up with outpatient providers 
- ___ 600 mg po q6h prn pain 
. 
#. Glaucoma: stable during this admission 
- Continue betimol 0.5% drops for right eye 
- Patient to follow up with her outpatient ophthalmologist
