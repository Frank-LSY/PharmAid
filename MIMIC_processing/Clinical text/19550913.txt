Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital 
after surgical removal of your gallbladder on ___. You 
tolerated the procedure well and are ambulating, stooling, 
tolerating a regular diet, and your pain is controlled by pain 
medications by mouth. You are now ready to be discharged to 
home. Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy 
and uneventful recovery.  
 ACTIVITY:  
 - Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.  
 - You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day.  
 - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.  
 - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.  
 - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first.  
 - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks.  
 - You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told 
you otherwise.  
 HOW YOU MAY FEEL:  
 - You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.  
 - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.  

 YOUR BOWELS:  
 - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool 
softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such 
as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of 
these medicines without a prescription.  
 - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.  
 - After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon. 
 
 PAIN MANAGEMENT:  
 - You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone 
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated.  
 - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. 
 
 If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:  
 - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours  
 - chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness  
 - cough, shortness of breath, wheezing  
 - pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever  
 - shaking chills, fever of more than 101  
 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain  
 - nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications  
 - if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)  
 -any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you  
 Additional:  
 *- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back  
 *- urinary: burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate 
 
 MEDICATIONS:

as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
