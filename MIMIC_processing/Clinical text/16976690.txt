Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course - PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY

Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing robotic right 
partial

nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; 
please see dictated operative note for details.

The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient 
ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, JP and urethral Foley 
catheter were removed without difficulty and diet was advanced 
as tolerated. The remainder of the hospital course was 
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable 
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding 
without difficulty, and

with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was 
clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection 
or infection. The patient was given explicit instructions to 
follow-up in clinic in approximately four weeks time.
