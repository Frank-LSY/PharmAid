Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female who was admitted to the hospital with right 
upper quadrant pain. She noted a change in her skin color and 
reported to an OSH where she was found to have an elevated 
bilirubin.  She underwent an ultrasound which showed stones in 
the gallbladder and chronic wall thickening. Because of her 
elevated bilirubin, she underwent an ERCP where multiple stone 
and sludge were swept from the common bile duct.  The patient's 
liver function tests were monitored.  She was taken to the 
operating room on HD # 2 where she underwent a laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy. During dissection, it was reported that a stone 
was noted in the distal cystic duct which could not be squeezed 
back.  A ___ drain was left in the gallbladder fossa at the 
end of the procedure. 

The operative course was stable with minimal blood loss.  The 
patient was extubated after the procedure and monitored in the 
recovery room.  Her incisional pain was controlled with oral 
analgesia.  She resumed clear liquids and advanced to a regular 
diet.  She was ambulatory and voiding without difficulty. She 
resumed her home medications.

The patient was discharge on POD #1.  The ___ drain was 
removed prior to discharge.  Discharge instructions were 
reviewed and questions answered.  A follow-up appointment was 
made in the Acute care clinic.  The patient was instructed to 
follow-up with her primary care provider.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Of note, on review of imaging reports, the patient was noted to 
have steatosis of the liver.  A copy of the ultra-sound report 
was given to the patient.  The patient was instructed to 
follow-up with her primary care provider for further evaluation.
