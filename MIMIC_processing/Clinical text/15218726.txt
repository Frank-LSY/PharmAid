Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD#0, the patient required a straight catheterization after she 
was bladder scanned for over 600 mL.  She was then able to void 
independently thereafter.
POD#1, the patient asked to be changed to Tramadol for pain 
control, then was changed back to Oxycodone when her pain 
increased. 

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Eliquis 2.5 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
Aquacel dressing remained clean and intact without erythema or 
abnormal drainage/saturation. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge, the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact.
  
The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with anterior hip 
precautions.  No hip bridging, no repetitive resistant hip 
flexion.  Please use walker or 2 crutches for as long as you 
need. They physical therapist will help guide you until you are 
safe to wean from assistive devices.
