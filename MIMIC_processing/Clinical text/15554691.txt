Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

POD#0 Mr. ___ appreciated a 1L blood loss and an afternoon 
hematocrit was stable at 37.  POD#1 he was mildly tachycardic to 
105 and a 500 cc fluid bolus was given. On POD#2 his white blood 
cell count was mildly elevated at 12.2 and a urine analysis was 
found negative for urinary tract infection.  A urine culture was 
pending at time of discharge.  

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was 
removed and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. 
The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical 
incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or 
abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical 
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and 
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was 
acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral 
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and 
the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions. 


Mr. ___ is discharged to home with services in stable
