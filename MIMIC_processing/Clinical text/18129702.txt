Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of HTN, HLD, 
OSA on CPAP, and depression presenting with audiovisual 
hallucinations; ultimately felt to be due to possible underlying 
neurodenegerative cause exacerbated by sleep deprivation. Ms. 
___ hallucinations self-resolved with sleep using CPAP. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[] Please refer to OT for neurocognitive assistance
[] Recommend formal neurocognitive testing
[] Ensure adequate sleep and appropriate CPAP use
[] Follow up Syphilis testing (pending at discharge)
[] Follow up with Neurology in ___ months
[] Please ensure that patient obtains CPAP machine as an 
outpatient

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy
# Audiovisual Hallucinations
Patient reported complex visual hallucinations which started 
shortly after recent vacation to ___. STox/UTox negative, 
TSH wnl, B12 wnl, and HIV negative. Her NCHCT on admission was 
without abnormality. Neurology was consulted, who recommended 
EEG and MRI for further evaluation. Her EEG was without seizure 
activity, and her MRI was without abnormalities. The 
differential was broad however felt to less likely represent 
infection (no fevers, chills, or leukocytosis), stroke (NCHCT 
wnl), seizures (EEG normal), toxicology syndrome (UTox/STox 
negative and patient denied substance use). Was overall most 
concerning for an underlying neurogenerative condition that was 
exacerbated by sleep deprivation and lack of CPAP use 
(potentially with worsened hypercarbia). Her hallucinations 
resolved prior to discharge. At discharge, her syphilis antibody 
was still pending. OT was consulted for neurocognitive testing, 
and recommended outpatient OT follow up. She should have formal 
neurocognitive testing as an outpatient. Otherwise, she is to 
follow up with Neurology in ___ months. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# HTN
- Continued home Felodipine 10 mg PO DAILY, Hydrochlorothiazide 
12.5 mg PO DAILY, and Metoprolol Succinate XL 50 mg PO DAILY 

# HLD
Continued home Simvastatin 20 mg PO QPM 

# Primary prevention
Continued home Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 

# OSA 
Patient was previously on CPAP, however no longer uses at home 
(and instead uses a dental implant, which she lost during her 
recent vacation). During her hospitalization, she was restarted 
on CPAP. She is to work on getting a CPAP machine as an 
outpatient (was provided with the phone numbers to call to 
coordinate this) and will need outpatient provider ___.
