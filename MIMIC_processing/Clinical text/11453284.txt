Imaging/Reports:
TTE at ___: 
CONCLUSIONS  
 1. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal, with 
an estimated LVEF of 55-60%. Details above.  
 2. There is a mild to moderate pericardial effusion with the 
greatest accumulation seen anteriorly and along the right heart. 
Echo criteria for hemodynamically significant pericardial 
effusion noted (right not left heart findings).  
 3. No significant valvular heart disease visualized on this 
study.  
 4. No prior ___ report available for comparison. Findings 
reviewed with patient in person.  
 

TTE on ___: 
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are most 
consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is a moderate sized pericardial 
effusion. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There 
is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with 
impaired filling/tamponade physiology. 

IMPRESSION: 
1) Small to moderately sized serous pericardial effusion largely 
located anterior to the apex of the RV. There is brief RA and 
very subtle diastolic RV collapse suggestive of mild tamponade 
physiology however there is no variation in mitral inflow 
pattern. Pericardial tamponade is a clinical diagnosis and 
echocardiographic signs are ancillary to this diagnosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old woman with a hx of childhood tuberculosis 
and endometrial polyps who presented to ___ with intermittent 
dyspnea after exercise for one year, worsening in the last 2 
weeks, found to have a moderate to large pericardial effusion. 

ACUTE ISSUES
=============
#Pericardial effusion: Patient has had trace pericardial 
effusions seen on CT scans in the past, and presented now with 
dyspnea after exercise x ___ year, with worsening over the past 
two weeks. Possible etiologies include TB (per patient, treated 
for 6 months in a sanatorium in ___ as a child), autoimmune 
disease (patient states that her hands sometimes swell up; 
negative RF, CRP 0.7, ___ neg), or malignancy (though less 
likely given CT scan in the last 6 mo with no evidence). Could 
also be another infectious source (patient has traveled through 
rural ___ in last ___ years and reports a rabies exposure last 
year). Less likely viral or idiopathic given chronicity of 
symptoms. Trops <0.01 x2. She was started on ibuprofen and 
colchicine. On ___, she was well appearing, with no pulsus 
paradoxus present. TTE on ___ with effusion size of 1.8cm, 
largely anterior to RV. Mild RV diastolic collapse. No variation 
of mitral inflow pattern. Overall concerning for mild tamponade 
physiology on echo. Given difficult location for 
pericardiocentesis, and the fact that the patient exhibited no 
clinical signs or symptoms of tamponade (no pulsus, no JVD, no 
hypotension, nL heart sounds), a decision to defer drainage of 
the effusion was made. On discharge, she was well-appearing, 
with improved SOB with exertion. She continued on the ibuprofen 
and colchicine to be followed up as outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
#Tuberculosis: unclear if fully cleared as a child. No evidence 
of active TB on CT scans or CXR. Pericardial effusion pattern 
also not consistent with TB. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
-Continue ibuprofen x2 weeks and colchicine x3 month (reassess 
need at follow up appointment)
-F/u ESR, blood cx
-F/u with cardiology for repeat TTE

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
-You were admitted because you had shortness of breath and were 
found to have fluid around your heart. 

What happened while I was in the hospital?  
-While you were in the hospital, you were started on 
anti-inflammatory medications to decrease the fluid around your 
heart. You also underwent an ultrasound of your heart to assess 
the amount of fluid and the location of the fluid. The location 
of the fluid was too risky to drain, so the fluid was not tapped 
and you will be sent home with frequent monitoring to ensure 
that the fluid does not worsen over time. 

What should I do after leaving the hospital?  
-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary 
and follow up at the listed appointments. 
-Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have 
any of the danger signs noted below. 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!  

 Your ___ Healthcare Team
