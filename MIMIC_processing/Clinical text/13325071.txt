Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with remote history of 
cardiac arrest c/b blindness in her left eye and HTN who was 
admitted ___ for acute onset vision loss in her right eye. 
She went to the ED where she was found to have a central retinal 
artery occlusion. She refused all further workup and refused to 
have any new medications added on. She will need to f/u with her 
PCP to discuss goals of care and tapering of her medications. 
She expressed to us that she is DNR/DNI. 

# Blindness: The etiology of the clot leading to the central 
retinal artery occlusion in Ms. ___ is likely cardiogenic 
vs atheroembolic. The source of the clot remained unknown 
because the patient declined MRA and MRI and subsequently 
declined all other medical interventions stating that she did 
not want any further testing: "When it's my time, then it's my 
time." She was judged to be of sound mind to make such decisions 
and was aware of the risks of additional stroke. Family was also 
at bedside for this conversation and also understand the risk 
for stroke. 

# Neurologic status: The patient remained stable throughout her 
stay without gross changes in neurologic status. 

#GU: She was found to have urinalysis findings consistent with 
urinary tract infection however she had no symptoms and thus was 
not treated. Also never had a fever or white count.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of blindness in your right 
eye resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
- hypertension

We are changing your medications as follows:
n/a. We discussed the risks and benefits of an antiplatelet 
agent called Plavix. You requested that we not start you on any 
new medications as you wanted to be comfortable. We spoke about 
the risk of stroke, and you verbalized understanding. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
