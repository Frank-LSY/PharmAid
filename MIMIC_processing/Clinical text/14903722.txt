History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of HTN and
recent TIA who presented to ___ from an OSH with hypotension.
Per OSH records, she had pain in her epigastric area that
radiated to her back. She received vancomycin and 1L NS. She was
also noted to have hyperkalemia and a junctional rhythm at the
time. She was then transferred to ___.

On arrival to ___, she was normotensive, afebrile, and
bradycardic. She was given Zosyn for concern for biliary 
etiology
of her pain. She was hypotensive and placed on levophed. Her 
labs
showed a transaminitis, ___, lactic acidosis. 

She had a CTA of her abdomen that showed: 
"1. Again seen is a mildly distended gallbladder with 
surrounding
mild pericholecystic fluid, similar to the outside reference
noncontrast CT study, for which acute cholecystitis cannot be
excluded. 
2. Prominent soft tissue is noted at the level of the ileo-cecal
valve, which can be concerning for mass. 
3. Moderate cardiomegaly with small right and trace left pleural
effusions. 
4. 6.8 cm left adnexal cystic lesion is incompletely
characterized on this exam."

On arrival to the ICU, she states she has no abdominal pain and
does not think she had any abdominal pain recently. She states
she initially presented to the ED because she was achy all over
and had pain in her back. She asks when she will be allowed to
eat.

Review of systems was negative except as detailed above.

IMAGING:
========
___ RUQ US: ildly distended gallbladder with diffuse wall 
thickening is equivocal for
acute cholecystitis versus reactive gallbladder wall edema.  
Sonographic
___ sign could not be elicited.  No cholelithiasis.

___ Chest Xray: In the setting of mild cardiomegaly, new 
interstitial abnormality
predominantly at the right lung base is probably edema.  Lungs 
elsewhere are
clear.  Pleural effusions small if any.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Mild cardiomegaly.  Mild acute pulmonary edema.

___ CTA AP: 
1. No intra-abdominal abscess, or a source of infection seen in 
the chest,
abdomen and pelvis.
2. A mildly distended gallbladder with surrounding 
pericholecystic fluid,
similar to the outside reference noncontrast CT study, which 
remains equivocal
for acute cholecystitis versus reactive gallbladder wall edema.
3. Right-sided cardiac overload with small right and trace left 
pleural
effusions.  Small volume ascites in the abdomen and pelvis.
4. Severe (greater than 50%) focal narrowing of the superior 
mesenteric artery
located 1.3 cm distal to the ostium with mild (less than 50%) 
narrowing of the
origin of the celiac artery.
5. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without acute 
diverticulitis.
6. 6.8 cm left adnexal cystic lesion for which differential 
considerations
include lymphocele, or adnexal cyst.  Non urgent pelvic 
ultrasound may be
performed for better evaluation, if clinically relevant.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY FOR ADMISSION:
===============================
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of HTN, 
CKD and recent TIA who presented to ___ from an OSH with 
hypotension of unclear etiology. She initially required ICU 
admission for pressor support which was quickly weaned. Notably 
CTA AP without acute abdominal process. With resolution of 
hypotension she was transferred to the medical service for 
onging monitoring and evaluation. Exact trigger for hypotensive 
episode unclear, however patient stabilized and felt safe for 
discharge. 

ACUTE Issues Address:
#Shock, unclear etiology: Unclear etiology of initial 
hypotension. She presented to ___ with acute onset 
epigastric pain and hypotension. Initial concern for aortic 
dissection however CT chest and abdomen without evidence of this 
pathology. CT AP initially read as concerning for acute 
cholecystitis. She was dosed with zosyn and transferred to the 
___ ED where a CTA A/P was completed ___. This study was 
equivocal for acute cholecystitis and notable for some narrowing 
of the SMA. She was evaluated by ___ surgical serivce who felt 
clinical presentation was not consistent with acute 
cholecystitis. No other infectious source was identified and 
blood cultures remained negative. Empiric Ceftriaxone and 
Azithromycin was continued while in the ICU and discontinued 
___. She briefly required pressor support on ___ which was 
quickly weaned and patient transitioned to the medicine service. 
Regarding other etiologies, patient noted to be bradycardic at 
___ with rates 40-60s. ECHO was pursued to evaluate 
for cardiac etiology of hypotension which was notable for 
hyperdynamic LV, RV dysfunction and evidence of pulmonary 
hypertension. Notably no bradycardia present on telemetry at 
___. Following ICU transfer, Ms. ___ was normotensive and 
asymptomatic and exact etiology of hypotension unclear.

#Acute Kidney Injury on CKD: Cr 2.7 on admission, baseline per 
___ records 1.0-1.3 Likely in the setting of hypotension and pre 
renal injury. Sr Cr down trended during admission to 1.3 (her 
apparent baseline). Lisinopril 5mg daily was initiated for 
management of blood pressure in the setting of CKD. 

#Acute Abdominal pain: CTA AP with some narrowing of SMA, 
overall patient's presentation concerning for episode of 
hypotension which triggered transient bowel ischemia (as seen by 
elevated lactate to 4.6). She had no abdominal pain with eating 
to suggest baseline mesenteric ischemia. She had no signs of 
acute cholecystitis per ACS review of imaging and no abdominal 
pain prior to discharge. 

#Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: ECHO pursued as 
above in setting of undifferentiated shock. ECHO notable for 
normal left ventricular cavity size with normal regional and 
hyperdynamic global systolic function. Mild right ventricular 
cavity dilation with normal free wall motion. Moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation. Moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. She had some 
evidence of volume overload on CT imaging however was euvolemic 
on physical exam and stable on room air and not dyspneic with 
usual exertion (e.g. walking hallways on unit). Diuresis was 
thus not pursued at this time. 
[] trend standing weights, if increasing or she develops other 
signs/symptoms to suggest symptomatic HFpEF, would have low 
threshold to initiate loop diuretic

#Sinus Bradycardia: Heart rates 40-60 at ___ and on 
presentation to ___. Appeared to be sinus. No further episodes 
on telemetry. ECHO findings as above. Nodal agents (atenolol and 
nifedipine) discontinued on discharge.

#Mild Transaminitis: No biliary dilation on RUQ US obtained 
___, mild elevation likely from hypotensive episode and down 
trended during admission.

#Normocytic Anemia: Hemoglobin 11.9 in ___ per ___ 
records, Hgb 10.3 on admission. No evidence of active bleeding 
currently. Low suspicion for hemolysis. Iron studies consistent 
with anemia of chronic disease.

#Thrombocytopenia, Sub acute: Platelet 104, recently 140 in ___ 
records, suppression may be seen in setting of acute illness. 
Remained stable during admission.

CHRONIC Issues:
================
#HTN: Continued home atorvastatin, aspirin. She was started on 
Lisinopril 5mg on discharge after home atenolol and nifedipine 
were discontinued.

#H. Pylori: Patient unable to complete antibiotic course, will 
need to be resumed following discharge if able to tolerate.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Recommend CBC, Chemistry, LFT check at PCP follow on ___ to 
ensure stability of platelets, renal function and resolution of 
mild transaminitis. 
[] Patient's Atenolol and Nifedipine discontinued during 
admission given initial bradycardia in setting of hypotension. 
She was discharged on Lisinopril 5mg daily and will require 
repeat chemistry at PCP follow up ___.
[] ___ noted to be narrowed on CTA AP ___, if patient 
experiencing abdominal pain with eating, recommend Vascular 
Surgery referral
[] ECHO completed ___ notable for moderate pulmonary HTN. She 
was asymptomatic during admission, recommended further 
evaluation as outpatient. Specifically evauation for need of 
loop diuretic.
[] Trend standing weights, if weight increasing or she develops 
other signs/symptoms to suggest symptomatic HFpEF, would have 
low threshold to initiate loop diuretic
[] Consider holter monitor as outpatient if ongoing concern for 
episodes of bradycardia
[] Patient unable to complete antibiotic course for H. ___, 
___ need to be resumed following discharge if able to tolerate 
and if within her goals of care.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

Thank you for choosing ___ as your site of care!

Why was I admitted to ___?
- You were admitted to the hospital because of back pain and low 
blood pressures.

What was done for me while I was hospitalized?
- You had a CT scan of your abdomen and chest which did not show 
changes of your aorta. This study showed that one of the blood 
vessels in your abdomen is slightly narrowed. This could have 
caused some of the abdominal pain when your blood pressure was 
low.
- We looked at your heart and looked for infection and there was 
not a clear cause of your low blood pressure.
- Your heart rate was low at ___ Hospital so we changed your 
home blood pressure medications.

What should I do when I leave the hospital?
- Please follow your new medication regimen. This means you will 
no longer take Atenolol or Nifedipine. Please take the 
Lisinopril 5mg daily and notify your doctor if you experience 
dizziness, light headedness or feeling like you are going to 
pass out.
- You will have your labs rechecked by your Primary care 
provider

___ wish you the best!
