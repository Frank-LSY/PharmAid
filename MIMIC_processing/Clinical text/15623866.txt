thought about suicide as a means of escape. He states that he 
has

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with one prior psychiatric

a higher level of care due to the severity of his depression and 
presence of passive suicidal ideation. Patient endorses severe

function (sleep, appetite w/ weight loss, energy, concentration,

future orientation, and increasing thoughts of suicidal 
ideation. Per wife, patient presented similarly in ___ with a
