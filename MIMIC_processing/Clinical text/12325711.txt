IMAGING
========
Coronary angiography ___:
Dominant Lcx STEMI succesfully treated with 1 DES.

TTE ___:
Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular cavity size 
with mild regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with 
single vessel coronary artery disease (LCX distribution). Mild 
aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Mild mitral 
regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
***<30 DAY REHAB STAY***

====================
PATIENT SUMMARY:
====================
___ is a ___ male with cerebral palsy and 
cognitive
disability, who presented to ___ with SOB for 2
days, and acute vomiting and rash, treated for anaphylaxis, who 
later
developed chest pain, found to have EKG concerning for STEMI,
transferred to ___ now s/p DES to ___. 

====================
ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
# Inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
The patient presented with typical angina with associated ST 
elevations in the inferior leads II > III, and trop- t peaked to 
15.01. He arrived to ___ and had an emergent coronary 
angiography (via ___ access ) that revealed a moderate thrombus 
in the proximal and mid
segments of the LCx, and a 99% stenosis in the proximal and mid 
segments of the LCx. He underwent PCI with a DES to LCX with no 
clinically significant complications. His clinical course after 
revascularization was appropriate. He underwent TTE that showed 
normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic 
dysfunction (EF 39%) most consistent with single vessel coronary 
artery disease (LCX distribution). He did not have further 
episodes of chest pain. He was started on the appropriate goal 
directed therapy for acute coronary syndrome.

#Respiratory failure (resolved).
There was an initial concern for respiratory failure on 
admission, due to breathing resembling ___ 
respirations. Possibly these respirations were baseline for him 
due to cerebral palsy. VBG was unremarkable. CXR only showed 
mild pulmonary edema and atelectasis. During his 
hospitalization, these respirations resolved and he was weaned 
off the O2 with appropriate tolerance. A repeat CXR was 
unchanged and given the absence of infectious symptoms or 
uptrending leukocytosis, aspiration pneumonia was considered 
unlikely.

#Anaphylaxis / Urticaria
Admitted to ___ initially with anaphylaxis of unknown 
trigger. No new foods or medications, per patient. Urticaria 
resolved with IV Benadryl. The only allergy of note is Latex but 
given that he is a poor historian we were unable to determine 
other exposures. It might be relevant for him to follow-up with 
Allergy specialist as an outpatient.

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================
#HLD.
Upon admission patient was on atorvastatin 20 mg. This was 
uptitrated to atorvastatin 80 mg as part of high-intensity 
therapy given acute coronary syndrome.

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Monitor BP and consider uptitrating metoprolol and starting 
ACEi when indicated.
[] Continue to monitor respirations , and possible ___ 
breathing pattern
[] As per Speech/Swallow consult - patient with high risk of 
aspiration so will continue diet with nectar thickened liquids 
and soft solids. Consider outpatient video-swallow.
[] Monitor CBC, repeat in 1 week (___), and consider 
outpatient follow-up for macrocytic/normocytic anemia 
[] Consider outpatient Allergy ___ for anaphylaxis
[] Please repeat TTE in ___ weeks to assess LV function
[] Please repeat BMP in 1 week (___)
