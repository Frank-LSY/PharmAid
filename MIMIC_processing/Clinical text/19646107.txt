Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a motor vehicle collision. Your 
injuries include multiple left sided facial fractures and 
multiple bilateral rib fractures. You were admitted for pain 
control and observation. Plastic Surgery evaluated you and would 
like to see you in 1 week to discuss repair of the facial 
fractures. Opthalmology saw you and determined there was no 
injury to the left eye, and you can follow-up as needed with an 
ophthalmologist if you develop any vision problems. 

Your pain is well controlled on ibuprofen alone and you are 
ambulating and tolerating a regular diet. Your vital signs are 
all stable. You are ready to be discharged home to continue your 
recovery. 

Please note the following discharge instructions: 

* Your injury caused multiple rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

SINUS PRECAUTIONS:

- Do not forcefully spit for several days.

- Do not smoke for several days.

- Do not use straws for several days.

- Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even 
though your sinus may feel stuffy or there may be some nasal 
drainage.

- Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If 
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

- Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew on 
the opposite side of your mouth.
