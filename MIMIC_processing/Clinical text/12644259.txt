History of Present Illness:
ON INTERVIEW IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM: 
___ is a ___ man with a history of depression and 
panic attacks who was brought to the ___ ED by EMS after he 
was found running around barefoot on the train tracks near a 
live rail. Psychiatry was consulted for evaluation and safety 
assessment.

When asked how he got to the ED, he responded, "A lot of people 
thought I was going crazy, and I understand why." He also adds, 
"I know I was scaring people. I didn't know what to do." ___ 
then described what he estimates to be a week-long period in 
which he has been "operating on a different level from everyone
else." He thinks this all started shortly after he went to 
"family camp" this year, where he works every year along with 
his family to help teach Buddhism to children. He is not sure 
why, but he felt like he became elevated at camp this year and 
started "having these really intense shifts in perception." He 
also describes it as "the straw that broke the camel's back."

He expressed awareness that he is no longer seeing the world in 
the same way that other people see it, and it bothers him that 
this seems to be scaring people at times. At several points 
during the interview, he drew analogies to The Matrix and video 
games because he feels that the world around him might not
actually be real (numerous times questioning whether this writer 
actually exists). In fact, he is not certain whether he is alive 
or not or whether he is about to be "hospitalized forever" or 
incarcerated. He speculated aloud whether running around on the 
train tracks was real or not--he had thought he was in a video 
game. When asked who brought him to the hospital, he mentioned 
that they were "characters" in the video game but then is unable 
to describe how he got here beyond that. 

He says that his hands have more cuts and scrapes on them than 
he remembers (while staring at his hands). He also says that he 
is consciously slowing himself down while talking to this writer 
so that he is easier to understand. He says he has learned this 
skill through practicing meditation. When asked how much he has 
been sleeping recently, he says he has naturally been waking up 
earlier and earlier because his practice of Buddhism has helped 
him to become more in tune with his body. He cannot estimate how 
many hours of sleep he has been getting each night because he 
says that his perception of time is no longer the same ("three 
days might seem like one day to me"). He has also had a 
decreased appetite over the past week, which he also achieves to 
being more
in tune with his body through Buddhism. He describes his energy 
level as "phenomenal." He says he feels like he's on LSD (which 
he has tried in a couple occasions in the past), but he denies 
currently being on LSD. While describing these symptoms, he 
added, "I know this looks like I'm manic to everyone else." He 
says that his sister has been "boxed in" by her diagnosis of
bipolar disorder, and he does not want to be restricted in that 
way. Rather, he expresses that he has achieved this elevated 
state through his practice of Buddhism.

COLLATERAL (mother - ___:
___ began feeling depressed in late high school and was
definitely depressed throughout college. He began seeing a
therapist and started antidepressants (?Prozac), which seemed to
help him. He continued this for a couple years and then took
himself off last year (___).

___ was himself until family camp this year. His mother
describes noticing intense mood swings and intense interactions
with other people. He was scaring other people. He also began
noticing more vibrant colors that he felt the need to point out
to his mother, and he also pointed out the number of birds 
flying
in the sky as if it was a miraculous coincidence. To his mother,
this was reminiscent of her daughter's manic episodes many years
ago, when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, his
manic symptoms different in that they came on so suddenly, and
they also began to include delusions. He abruptly quit his job 
at
___. His mother talked to his roommates, who were also very
concerned about him. ___ began to get defensive when he sensed
people were talking about him or challenging his "insights." He
said to his mother, "You all just don't like it that I'm not
depressed for the first time in ___ years." 

His other sister had a baby 6 days ago. When his parents asked
him if he'd like to go meet his new niece, he asked, "Is this a
plot?" He finally agreed to take the bus to ___, but 
when
he got to ___, he called his parents and said, "I'm in
a different plane now. It's getting really hard. I need help."
His father went to meet him at ___, but ___ was
already gone. His roommates said he finally returned home at
around 3 or 4am and described that there were just so many 
people
he had to help, so he helped them. Last night, his mother tried
to meet him at his home in ___, but he was also gone by
the time he got there.

Although ___ mother describes a sudden onset to his recent
symptoms, she also recalls other changes and stressors that have
occurred over the past few years. Over the past ___ years, he 
has
seemed to have more panic attacks. Last year, he had an argument
with another man who was hitting on his girlfriend, and he said
that this led to a feeling of panic and chest tightening. In
___, his ___ apartment burned down in a fire, 
and
he and his friend narrowly escaped by jumping out a window, 
which
was traumatic for him. Very recently, he also broke up with his
girlfriend of ___ years.

ON INTERVIEW ON INPATIENT UNIT: 
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of depression
and anxiety who presented to the ED via ambulance after being
found climbing over the walls around train tracks and running
along the live rail. Patient says he was "playing" on the train
tracks. He endorses this as the inciting event which brought him
to the hospital, but says that admission to the ED was for
"breaking the rules" and not because of his mental health. When
asked about his family, who had accompanied him in the ED and 
had
expressed great concern for him over the past several days, the
patient says that "my mom had to go to a psych unit a long time
ago. So they were just worried about that I think." He states
that lately, his perceptions of taste and temperature have been
heightened, among other sensations. "Cold water feels colder and
hot water feels hotter." Patient also endorses occasional racing
thoughts "when I see beautiful people". He says that for the 
past
week, he has had poor appetite, has been drinking less water, 
and
has been exercising less than he usually does. He believes that
this is the cause of his sensory changes. Contrary to initial
interview in the ED, patient denies experiences of
depersonalization or de-realization, and denies euphoric mood. 
He
says that these statements were "a mistake" and that he said
those things because he felt nervous "speaking to a lot of new
people at once". He also denies ever having taught Buddhism or
that his meditation practices have had a significant impact on
his mental state. He denies SI/HI and AVH, and denies changes in
color perception, also contrary to initial interview in the ED.
     When asked about what happened when the patient's niece was
born last week, he says that "a new baby being born can be
stressful for a family", and says that he "got lost" on the way
to the hospital to see her. Patient says that he called his
family and was able to meet up with them "at a different
hospital. then everything was fine." He does not acknowledge
having gone missing until ___ the next day (as his mother
reports), or acknowledge any paranoid thoughts surrounding that
event. Patient denies reduced need for sleep, contrary to 
initial
ED interview. He denies depressed mood, endorses anxiety related
to "talking to new people and trying to remember new people".
Patient appears quite guarded on interview, but denies concerns
about hospital staff or taking medications.

time, Mr. ___ was not deemed to be at risk of harm to self or 
others and was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Mr. ___ 
was also placed on 15 minute checks status on admission and 
remained on that level of observation throughout while being 
unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Bipolar Disorder, Type 1, acute manic episode 
Mr. ___ presented to the emergency room with a recent change 
in mood, thinking, and behavior, suggestive of mania. He 
described a one-week period of decreased sleep drive, decreased 
appetite, high energy level, and elevated mood. He reported 
difficulty delineating reality (describing realization vs. 
dissociation, feeling as though he was in a movie or video game) 
and questioned whether those around him were real. Collateral 
from his mother notable for marked mood swings, inferring 
special meaning from colors in his surroundings, and abruptly 
quitting his recent job at ___. In the ED, he was notably 
inattentive, emotionally labile, with pressured speech and 
flight of ideas with loose associations. There was concern that 
his delusional thinking, derealization, and poor insight led to 
his dangerous behavior (i.e. running barefoot along train tracks 
near a live rail).

Mr. ___ accepted one dose of olanzapine 5mg on the night of 
admission to the inpatient unit. He tolerated this medication 
well which greatly improved his sleep. The next day, Mr. ___ 
demonstrated some insight into his symptoms, explaining that he 
feels that he has bipolar disorder and acknowledges that his 
symptoms prior to hospitalization were concerning for mania. He 
expresses regret regarding the effect his behavior had on those 
around him and some of the negative consequences of his behavior 
(i.e. missing the birth of his niece), which was discussed 
during a family meeting as well. He does not want to experience 
similar symptoms in the future and agrees to seek help should 
these or other symptoms return. He initially agreed to a trial 
of medication (with the encouragement of his parents) and 
tolerated up-titration of olanzapine to 10mg qhs. However, after 
one dose he declined further medications stating that he can 
"take care of it" on his own with music and self-care, adding 
that he slept well without olanzapine. On exam, he was calm and 
cooperative with the interview and his speech had regular rate, 
rhythm, and volume. He had a euthymic, stable affect without any 
frank delusional content (though suspect some ongoing delusions 
of grandeur). He denied any thoughts of self-harm or harm 
towards others and his thought process was notably linear and 
goal-oriented. Thus, his clinical presentation was no longer 
concerning for acute mania and the patient declined further 
hospitalization for medication establishment/management and 
additional stabilization. He was amenable to follow-up with 
outpatient psychiatric providers and has new appointments 
scheduled through ___ OP Behavioral Health. He has also 
expressed interest in establishing care with his former 
therapist in ___. He declined psychiatric medication 
upon discharge but was open to discussing possible maintenance 
medications with his outpatient providers. 

Two family meeting were held with Mr. ___ and his parents 
during his hospitalization. They noted that he appeared more 
well-rested and improved from time of admission. They expressed 
fear and concern by his behavior prior to presentation and 
encouraged Mr. ___ to include medications as part of his 
treatment plan going forward. They felt comfortable with patient 
being discharged to their care and to stay in ___ for a 
while (where he has marked social support from them and their 
extended family). They are also very familiar with the signs and 
symptoms of mania and feel comfortable seeking help should these 
return or should they have concerns for the patient's safety or 
well-being. The patient was in agreement with this plan as well. 


3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Cannabis Use Disorder
Mr. ___ was counseled regarding the negative effects of 
cannabis upon mental/physical health and abstinence from 
cannabis was encouraged. He acknowledged the importance of 
refraining from cannabis use and it's effects on his mental 
health. 

#) Nicotine Use Disorder
Mr. ___ was counseled regarding the negative effects of 
smoking tobacco upon mental/physical health and abstinence from 
smoking was encouraged. He was offered a nicotine patch during 
admission and given a prescription for this on discharge though 
he declined.

4. MEDICAL
In the Emergency Department, Mr. ___ had persistently elevated 
blood pressure to the SBP 150's-160's and was intermittently 
tachycardic with elevated temperatures in the high ___. 
This was felt to be consistent with agitation in the setting of 
psychosis (vs. intoxication with a stimulant though notably his 
serum and urine toxicology were negative). Mr. ___ was 
medically cleared in the ED. His vitals normalized on the 
inpatient unit and he had no acute medical issues while on 
___ or chronic medical issues requiring attention.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
Mr. ___ was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
occupational therapy and social work groups that focus on 
teaching patients various coping skills. Mr. ___ often 
attended and participated in these groups. He was often visible 
on the milieu and appropriately interacted with staff and peers.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Mr. ___ did not have either an outpatient psychiatrist or 
therapist while admitted on Deac 4, therefore there were no 
outside providers to be contacted. Mr. ___ was referred to 
both an outpatient psychiatrist and therapist upon discharge.

Mr. ___ gave verbal permission for the team to contact his 
___ and ___, who provided collateral 
information, attended family meetings during his 
hospitalization, and were given an update on Mr. ___ 
progress while admitted and involved in discharge planning. 

6. INFORMED CONSENT: 
*Medication: Zyprexa (olanzapine)
---Benefits: Mood stabilization, treatment of paranoia
---Adverse effects: Dizziness, sedation, dry mouth, 
constipation, nausea, weight gain, peripheral edema, headache, 
body aches, tachycardia, hypotension/orthostatic hypotension 
(usually during initial dose titration), increased risk of 
diabetes and dyslipidemia, tardive dyskinesia (rare), seizures 
(rare, dose-related)

Mr. ___ was informed of alternative treatments, the 
consequences of no treatment, and the expected duration of 
treatment. He appeared to appreciate the information conveyed in 
the consent process by asking appropriate questions, which were 
answered by the treatment team, and expressing understanding of 
the potential risks and benefits (see above).  Prior to starting 
treatment, the team also discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take this medication as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment. Mr. ___ 
understood the above and consented to begin the medication, 
however, then declined to take this medication and refused 
alternative medications during this hospitalization. He was not 
discharged with any outpatient medications. 

7. RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, Mr. ___ was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself given his risky behavior 
(running barefoot along the train tracks near a live line) and 
symptoms concerning for acute mania. Mr. ___ static risk 
factors noted at that time include history of trauma (reportedly 
nearly died in an apartment fire), history of substance use 
(marijuana, alcohol, tobacco), remote history of self-injurious 
behavior (remote history as a young child), family history of 
mental illness (sister with bipolar disorder), male gender, 
Caucasian ethnicity, adolescent age, single relationship status, 
and recent unemployment. The modifiable risk factors identified 
were as such: disorganized and unpredictable behavior, active 
substance use (alcohol, cannabis, tobacco), impulsivity, 
medication noncompliance (self-discontinued ?SSRI in ___, 
poorly controlled mental illness, no established outpatient 
providers, poor reality testing, insomnia, acutely stressful 
events (missing the birth of his niece, abruptly quit job). 
These modifiable risk factors were addressed with acute 
stabilization in a safe environment on a locked inpatient unit, 
psychopharmacologic treatment, psychotherapeutic interventions 
(OT groups, SW groups, individual therapy meetings with 
psychiatrists), and presence on a social milieu environment. Mr. 
___ is being discharged with many protective factors, 
including sense of responsibility to family and self, life 
satisfaction, future-oriented viewpoint, strong social supports, 
lack of suicidal ideation, no prior suicide attempts, 
spirituality (Buddhism), no access to lethal weapons, and good 
coping skills. Overall, based on the totality of our assessment 
at this time, Mr. ___ is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
harm to self nor danger to others. 

Our prognosis of this patient is fair but guarded. He 
demonstrates some insight into his diagnosis of bipolar disorder 
and recent manic symptoms; however, he is ambivalent about the 
role of psychiatric medications in his treatment, declining all 
psychiatric medications at this time. However, he has a strong 
social support system and intends to stay with his parents in 
___, who are familiar with the mental ___ 
and signs concerning for acute mania. He is also amenable to 
following up with an outpatient psychiatrist, therapist and his 
primary care physician following discharge. He demonstrated 
preserved capacity to engage in a meaningful discussion about 
crisis planning in the event of worsening or recurrence of acute 
symptoms. At time of discharge he showed improvement of manic 
symptoms with good behavioral control and reality testing.
