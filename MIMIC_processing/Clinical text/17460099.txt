Discharge Instructions:
These steps can help you recover after your procedure. 
DO drink plenty of water to flush out the bladder. 
DO avoid straining during a bowel movement. Eat 
fiber-containing foods and avoid foods that can cause 
constipation. Ask your doctor if you should take a laxative if 
you do become constipated. 
Don't take blood-thinning medications until your doctor says 
it's OK. 
Don't do any strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 
four to six weeks or until your doctor says it's OK. 
Don't have sex. You'll likely be able to resume sexual 
activity in about four to six weeks. 
Don't drive until your doctor says it's OK. ___, you can 
drive once your catheter is removed and you're no longer taking 
prescription pain medications. 

You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve. You may 
have clear or yellow urine that periodically turns pink/red 
throughout the healing process. Generally, the discoloration of 
the urine is OK unless it transitions from ___, 
___ Aid to a very dark, thick or like tomato juice 
color

Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. 
You should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any 
medication changes and your post-operative course with your 
primary care team.  

Unless otherwise advised, blood thinning medications like 
ASPIRIN should be held until the urine has been clear/yellow for 
at least three days.  Your medication reconciliation will note 
if you may resume aspirin or prescription blood thinners (like 
Coumadin (warfarin), Xarelto, Lovenox, etc.)

If needed, you will be prescribed an antibiotic to continue 
after discharge or save until your Foley catheter is removed 
(called a trial of void or void trial).  

You may be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM 
that will help with the "burning" pain you may experience when 
voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.

Colace has been prescribed to avoid post surgical constipation 
and constipation related to narcotic pain medication. 
Discontinue if loose stool or diarrhea develops. Colace is a 
stool softener, NOT a laxative, and it is available 
over-the-counter 

AVOID STRAINING for bowel movements as this may stir up 
bleeding.  Avoid  constipating foods for ___ weeks, and drink 
plenty of fluids to keep hydrated

No vigorous physical activity or sports for 4 weeks or until 
otherwise advised

Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) or 
participate in high intensity physical activity (which includes 
intercourse) for a minimum of four weeks or until you are 
cleared by your Urologist in follow-up

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) should be your first-line pain 
medication. A narcotic pain medication may also be prescribed 
for breakthrough or moderate pain.  

The maximum daily Tylenol/Acetaminophen dose is 3 grams from 
ALL sources. 

Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do 
not operate dangerous machinery.
