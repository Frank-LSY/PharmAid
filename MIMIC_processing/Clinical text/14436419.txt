Per Dr. ___ ED Initial Psychiatry 
Consult note:
.
"Patient reports that he has been feeling depressed over thelast 
year or so in the setting of his orthodontic practices failing. 
He recently sold 2 of his 3 orthodontic practices and felt an 
immense amount of shame and disappointment in himself. This had 
led to a severe depression with suicidal ideation for months. He 
states, "to be honest, I had thought about killing himself every 
single morning for the last few months." What made him decide to 
act on these thoughts today was that he had just finalized the 
sale of one of the practices, and he couldn't bear the thought 
of going to his office and telling his employees. Instead, he 
drove to one of his now-vacated offices and intentionally sliced 
open his left forearm with a knife. He states he had no second 
thoughts after doing so and that his plan was to bleed to death.
.
After three hours had passed, without patient seeking for any 
help, he was found by one of his employees who went to look for 
him after he didn't show up at work. At this point, it was 
estimated that he had lost about a liter of blood, and he was 
brought to the hospital via EMS. A tourniquet was placed at the 
OSH and he was subsequently transferred to ___ for further
management.
.
When asked if he is glad he is still alive, Mr. ___ reports 
that he feels ambivalent about it and denies feeling upset that 
he was rescued. However, he now reports that he is no longer 
depressed and wants to be with his wife and daughter. He denies 
feeling suicidal anymore and that he feels "great." He does not 
respond when pointed out that he would have not been around for 
his wife and daughter if he died and that his life circumstances 
have not changed in the last 12 hours. He states that he does 
not want to be hospitalized because he feels better now and that 
he won't try to harm himself again."
.
In the ED, no PRNs or medications were given. Hand surgery team 
washed out wound and repaired laceration. X-ray of wrist showed 
soft tissue injury without underlying bony involvement. BMP, 
CBC, Coags, UA, urine and serum tox were unremarkable. Serum 
acetaminophen level of 92. Patient received Tdap per ED records.

life. Per patient he began experiencing suicidal thoughts back 
in ___ that progressively increased in frequency up to 
q2-3 hours leading up to patient's decision to end his life by 
cutting wrist in attempt to avoid failure and shame. Patient 
that in the last month he was required to sell the ___ of the 
his 3 Orthodontist businesses and could not bare the shame othis 
"failure." Since ___ he reports associated difficulty

On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary

status on admission and remained on that level of observation 
throughout while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
On admission, the patient noted increasing depressive symptoms 
in the last several months including insomnia, guilt, 
hopelessness, helplessness, low energy, anhedonia, poor 
concentration, lack of motivation and suicidal ideation. 
Following the suicidal attempt in the ED the patient initially 
voiced ambivalence about being alive, but then later he stated 
he was regretful of the attempt. He minimized his symptoms, and 
he did not feel that he needed an inpatient level of care. 
Stressors included financial problems resulting in him selling 2 
out of 3 of his orthodontic businesses, being overworked, and 
feeling socially isolated. Mental status exam was notable for an 
individual with dysphoric affect with limited range and poor 
insight and judgement. 
.
Diagnostically, the patient's presentation was most consistent 
with major depression disorder, severe. He denied mania and 
psychotic symptoms so less likely bipolar depression. The 
patient was started on fluoxetine 20mg to treat the depression. 
Denied any side effects from fluoxetine. He continued to have 
interrupted sleep, so he was started on trazodone, which 
improved his sleep. 
.
The patient initially minimized the severity of his suicide 
attempt, and express guilt and shame regarding his failing 
orthodontic practice. Through supportive therapy and some brief 
psychodynamic psychotherapeutic interventions, the patient began 
to reflect more deeply on the stressors preceding his suicide 
attempt. He also verbalized his desire to eventually move to ___ 
___, where one of his siblings lives, so he will have more 
support. He also verbalized his desire to spend more time with 
his family (including his daughter and wife) and his desire to 
work less. He reflected on his previous individual therapy, and

future in the event of worsening symptoms of depression. 
Treatment team also suggested that patient and his wife consider 
couples therapy to facilitate improvement in supportive 
communication. The patient expressed willingness to continue 
outpatient treatment with ___ who will refer 
patient to a prescribing clinician for medication management; in 
the interim, patient's established primary care provider ___ 
manage fluoxetine and trazodone. 
.
On discharge patient's mental status notable for mood congruent 
euthymic affect, linear, thought process, and future oriented 
thought content absent for current or ongoing suicidal ideation 
or thoughts/urges to engage in self-harm. He verbalized his 
intent to attend the referral to the partial hospital program 
(see below), in addition to attend post-discharge appointments 
with his established providers (Dr. ___ PCP).

and possible side effects and risks of starting this medication 
including not taking the medication, with this patient.  We 
discussed the patient's right to decide whether to take this 
medication as well as the importance of the patient's actively 
participating in the treatment and discussing any questions

.
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
Case discussed daily at multidisciplinary rounds; case also 
discussed in peer consultation during admission with Drs 
___, and ___. On initial presentation, 
the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an increased risk of 
harm to himself based upon a high risk, low likelihood of rescue 
suicide attempt, which seemed very premeditated with the patient 
having sold his practices in attempt to close his affairs prior 
to the attempt. His static factors noted at that time include 
male gender and history of suicide attempt. The modifiable risk 
factors upon admission included suicidal ideation, lack of 
engagement with outpatient treatment, hopelessness, social 
withdrawal, limited social supports, and recent financial loss. 
Many of these were addressed through initiation of psychotropic 
medication (fluoxetine and trazodone), connecting patient with 
outpatient mental health providers, and brief psychotherapeutic 
techniques. He noted that a lot of people cared for him, and he 
did not know how to reach out but feels more confident he could 
do so now. He denied suicidal ideation and hopelessness by 
discharge. Finally, the patient is being discharged with many 
protective risk factors, including his future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, children in the 
home, good problem-solving skills, follow up with outpatient 
mental health providers, no history of substance use disorder, 
lack of suicidal ideation, and no history of abuse. The patient 
demonstrated preserved capacity to engage in a meaningful 
conversation about safety planning; in the event of recurrent 
suicidal thoughts, the patient stated that he will contact his 
therapist or present to the emergency department. By the time of 
discharge, patient evidenced appreciation of the severity of his 
suicide attempt and stated consistently that he would reach out 
for help if suicidal thoughts returned. Overall, based on the 
totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at 
an acutely elevated risk of self-harm due to decompensated 
depressive symptoms.
