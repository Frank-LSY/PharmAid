Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ year old G2P2 who underwent a total 
abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy on ___ for 
symptomatic fibroid uterus. Please see the operative report for 
full details.

Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately 
post-op, her pain was controlled with IV Dilaudid/Toradol and a 
tap block. Post operatively, patient reported some chest 
pressure and right sided chest pain that was present even prior 
to the procedure. Given recent operation, cardiac work up 
initiated. She had a reassuring EKG, confirmed with cardiology 
and negative troponins. She was noted to have an appropriate 
drop in her hematocrit to 26.7 from 35.3. The chest pressure was 
relieved with IV pepcid. The EKG was later repeated upon 
re-presentation of chest pain, which returned normal. 

On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate, so her 
foley was removed, and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without difficulty, and she was transitioned to 
oxycodone/acetaminophen.

Throughout her stay, her hematocrit was trended as follows: 35.3 
(___) -> 26.7 (post-op, ___ -> 23 ___ AM) -> 23 ___ ___. 
For her depression, her escitalopram was continued.

By post-operative day 2, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.
