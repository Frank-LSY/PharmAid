History of Present Illness:
___ with HLD, current tobacco use, obesity, and anxiety who
presents with several weeks of intermittent chest pain. She
states that the pain is achy and at first localized to her R
shoulder, radiating to her R upper chest; since 2 days PTA, the
pain has now involved the L shoulder, upper chest, and side of
the neck. The pain was initially exertional (resolved within 1
hour after activity) but is now also present at rest. She also
reports a feeling that she has to go to the bathroom. No
associated SOB, lightheadedness/dizziness, syncope, diaphoresis,
nausea, vomiting. She states that SL nitro does not improve her
symptoms. Has not tried any other medications for the pain.

Of note, she underwent stress EKG on ___, during which she
experienced right-sided non-pleuritic chest tightness with EKG
showing 1mm horizontal ST depression in leads II, III, aVF, 
V2-V6
(with ~___levation in aVR). She then underwent stress echo
on ___, showing borderline LVH, LVEF 60%, no RWMA's. She
developed R-sided chest pain at 80% of maximal HR that was
initially reproducible. EKG showed slight upsloping of the ST
segments in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 at peak exercise. At rest, she
developed 1-___epressions in II, III, aVF, and
V4-V6. She was given SL nitro, which resolved her symptoms. Echo
images were normal.

She presented to OSH on ___ with chest pain, where trops were
neg, and EKG was normal. She was transferred to ___ for 
further
eval and plan for catheterization on ___ but left AMA
yesterday. She returned this afternoon due to recurrent 
symptoms.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.3, HR 80, BP 154/87, SpO2
100% on RA. EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with no evidence of ST
changes, TWI's, or Q waves. Labs were unremarkable; trops were
negative. UA with large leuks, few bacteria. She was given ASA 
81
mg x2 and SL nitro x1.

STUDIES:
========
Procedure
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the Left Anterior 
Descending and Left Circumflex systems.

LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is mild diffuse disease 
noted in the mid segment
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel.
The Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel. There is a 90% stenosis in the proximal segment.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is a 30% stenosis in the mid 
segment.
The SinoAtrial, arising from the proximal segment, is a small 
caliber vessel.

K-4.5 Cl-103 HCO3-24 AnGap-___ woman with dyslipidemia, possible familial 
hypercholesterolemia, current tobacco use (13-pack-year 
history), obesity, and anxiety who presents with several weeks 
of intermittent atypical chest and shoulder pain initially with 
exertion and now at rest, with ETT showing diffuse ST changes, 
concerning for unstable angina. She underwent coronary angiogram 
demonstrating 90% stenosis of the proximal obtuse marginal 
artery with placement of one drug-eluting stent to the OM. She 
was also noted to have 30% stenosis of the RCA. She was 
discharged on ASA/Plavix, Rosuvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol 
succinate. She will have close cardiology follow-up for 
consideration of PSK-9 inhibition.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Atypical chest pain
#Unstable angina
Ms. ___ reports about one month of achy chest pain that was 
first localized to her right shoulder, radiating to her right 
upper chest, and then involved her left shoulder, chest wall, 
and side of the neck. The pain was initially exertional and 
would resolve within one hour after activity; however, it 
progressed to being present at rest as well. Given her 
significant risk factors of current tobacco use (13-pack-year 
history), obesity, and familial hypercholesterolemia (not on a 
statin until very recently), she underwent stress EKG on ___ and 
stress echo on ___, both of which showed EKG changes concerning 
for diffuse ischemia; she also experienced right-sided chest 
tightness and pain with exercise that resolved with rest. She 
initially presented to OSH with recurrent chest pain and was 
transferred to ___ for further evaluation. At ___, trops 
were negative x3, and EKG showed no ischemic changes. She 
underwent coronary angiogram on ___ demonstrating 90% stenosis 
of the proximal obtuse marginal artery and 30% stenosis of the 
RCA. A drug-eluting stent was placed in the OM. She was started 
on aspirin 81 mg daily and Plavix 75 mg daily with plan to 
continue dual anti-platelet therapy for a minimum 12 months per 
Interventional Cardiology. She was also switched to rosuvastatin 
40 mg at bedtime and continued on metoprolol succinate 50 mg at 
bedtime.

#Dyslipidemia
#Possible familial hypercholesterolemia
On admission, patient's lipid panel was significant for 
cholesterol 205, LDL 138, HDL 29, triglycerides 190 (prior 
cholesterol in ___ was 336). She was switched to rosuvastatin 
as above and started on ezitimibe 10 mg at bedtime. Please 
consider starting a PCSK-9 inhibitor pending LDL improvement on 
statin/Zetia.

#Tobacco use
Patient was counseled around the risks of continued tobacco use 
especially given her early coronary artery disease. She was 
discharged with nicotine patches and gum, continued on 
bupropion, and provided with smoking cessation resources.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Anxiety - continued on lorazepam 0.5 mg at bedtime as needed

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Patient to have cardiology follow-up for consideration of 
PCSK-9 inhibitor for dyslipidemia depending on response to 
statin/Zetia

MEDICATIONS CHANGES:
====================
START Zetia 10 mg at bedtime
START rosuvastatin 40 mg at bedtime
START nicotine patch, gum
STOP atorvastatin

 DISCHARGE WORKSHEET TEMPLATE  
 ================================================  
 Dear Ms. ___,

 It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==========================  
 - You were admitted because you had chest pain 

 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==============================  
  - Your heart arteries were examined (cardiac catheterization) 
which showed a blockage of one of the arteries. This was opened 
by placing a tube called a stent in the artery. You were given 
medications to prevent future blockages.
 
 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
 ================================  
 - It is very important to take your aspirin and clopidogrel 
(also known as Plavix) every day.  
 - These two medications keep the stent in the heart vessel open 
and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack.
 - If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk 
causing a blood clot forming in your heart stent and having 
another heart attack. 
 - Please do not stop taking either medication without talking 
to your heart doctor.
 - You are also on other medications to help your heart, such as 
rosuvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol.

 Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!
