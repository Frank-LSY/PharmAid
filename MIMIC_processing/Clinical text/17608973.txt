your recovery with the following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
Please follow-up with your GI doctor for evaluation and 
management of Ulcerative Colitis. Please take all medications

throat during surgery.

away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages
