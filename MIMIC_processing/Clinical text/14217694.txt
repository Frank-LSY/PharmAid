Imaging
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF 
= 56 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.  

EUS:
Impression: EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 
___ MHz frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged 
from the duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body 
and tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body and 
fundus. 
Pancreas mass: A 4.4 cm X 3.6 cm ill-defined mass was noted in 
the uncinate of the pancreas. The mass was hypoechoic and 
heterogenous in echotexture. The borders of the mass were 
irregular and poorly defined. Fine needle biopsies with 22-gauge 
Sharkcore needle was performed of the pancreas mass after an 
avascular path was determined using color doppler. Four needle 
passes were made into the pancreas uncinate mass
Multiple liver lesions were found which were high suspicious 
for metastatic lesions. Fine needle biopsies with 22-gauge 
Sharkcore needle was performed of the liver mass after an 
avascular path was determined using color doppler. Four needle 
passes were made into the liver mass.
Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the uncinate, head, body 
and tail of the pancreas was homogenous, with a normal salt and 
pepper appearance. 
Pancreas duct: the pancreas duct measured 2 mm in maximum 
diameter in the body of the pancreas. The duct was normal in 
echotexture and contour. No intra-ductal stones were noted. No 
dilated side-branches were noted. 
Bile duct: the bile duct was unable to be visualized in the 
head of the pancreas
Pancreas head cyst: A 2 cm X 3 cm microcystic lesion was seen 
in the head of the pancreas. These appeared most compatible with 
a serous cystadenoma. No intrinsic mass or debris were noted 
within the cyst.
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum
 

Recommendations: Clear liquid diet when awake, then advance 
diet as tolerated.
If any fever, worsening abdominal pain, or post procedure 
symptoms, please call the advanced endoscopy fellow on call 
___/ pager ___.
Your pathology results will be sent to you and your referring 
doctor as soon as they are available. Please call Dr. ___ 
office (___) in 10 days if you have not received 
notification.
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx of htn, bipolar disorder presenting with early satiety, 
abdominal discomfort, and nausea, found to have pancreatic head 
mass, admitted for expedited evaluation and presentation for 
syncope and fall.

Pancreatic head mass
Nausea/abdominal pain:
Mass identified on CT with liver lesions concerning for 
metastatic disease. No evidence of cholestasis.  DDx includes 
malignancy (adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine, lymphoma), less 
likely autoimmune pancreatitis.  he underwent EUS noted above 
with bx of pancreas and liver lesions.  He tolerated the 
procedure well and was discharged with close MDC follow up.  CEA 
wnl, ___ pending and bx pending on discharge.

Syncope:
History does not suggest serious cardiac process but rather 
vasovagal related fall.  Echo reviewed.  EKG reviewed.  his QTc 
is mildly prolonged but on tele no evidence of arrhythmia
- Appreciate cardiology input
- Avoid QTc prolonging agents going forward and trend
- Ambulate

___: 
Admission creatinine at OSH went to 1.7 from baseline of 0.7.

Care Planning/Code status: FULL - briefly discussed on 
admission, pt states that he is in the process of discussing 
these issues with his wife

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were initially admitted due to a fall. Imaging done led to a

obtained and you will follow up in clinic later this week to 
discuss these results.

You will be following up with your doctors for further details 
regarding treatment

It was a pleasure being part of your care.
