Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY: 
================
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old ___ female with a history of hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, and aortic root dilation, currently undergoing 
workup for subacute history of frequent episodes of 
lightheadedness and a syncopal episode, who was referred to the 
emergency department for evaluation for urgent PPM after review 
of Holter monitor showed upwards of 40 second pauses consistent 
with sinus arrest. She had a dual chamber PPM inserted ___.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#SSS:
#Sinus arrest:
The patient has a subacute history of frequent episodes of 
lightheadedness and dizziness with associated syncopal episode 
on ___, for which she was undergoing workup by cardiology and 
neurology. She had a Holter monitor which revealed upwards of 40 
second pauses consistent with sinus arrest. It also showed 
episodes of what appeared to be atrial tachycardia, possible 
Aflutter, and junctional tachycardia. One of these sinus arrest 
episodes took place on ___ which coincides with the patient's 
syncopal episode. She underwent insertion of a left-sided dual 
chamber PPM on ___. During the insertion she was noted to have 
an episode of AVNRT, and in that setting she was started on 
metoprolol succinate 25mg daily. The etiology of her sinus 
arrest episode was felt to most likely be vagal. TFTs within 
normal limits, chol 171, LDL 104, HDL 55, A1c 5.7%. Ischemia 
unlikely given she would need to have pretty significant RCA 
disease and has no evidence of ACS or prior anginal symptoms. 
Consider infectious causes, Lyme sent for Western blot and is 
pending. Also consider infiltrative disease like sarcoid or 
amyloid. ___ warrant CMR in the future, however must wait 2 
months s/p PPM.

#Hepatic cysts:
Patient had ___ on ___ which incidentally showed several 
large echolucent masses in the liver which may be cysts. She had 
a RUQUS on ___ which revealed "Numerous heterogeneous, complex 
cysts with irregular borders and internal septations are seen 
within the liver, most notably including a dominant cyst within 
the right hepatic lobe measuring 10.8 x 11.0 x 7.8 cm and an 
adjacent cyst measuring 11.3 x 9.0 x 9.0 cm. Recommend dedicated 
MRI with contrast on a nonemergent basis for characterization 
within the next 3 months"

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#HLD:
Continued home simvastatin 20mg PO QPM.

#Valvular Heart disease:
Last ___ ___ showing LVEF 57%, PCWP <12 mmHg, mildly dilated 
aortic arch, MVP, 2+ MR, 1+AR. Plan per Dr. ___ to repeat ___ 
in ___ year. 

#Dilated ascending aorta:
Repeat ___ in ___ year.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[] Follow-up Lyme serologies
[] Syncopal episode most likely high vagal tone but can consider 
further workup for etiology of SSS as an outpatient
[] Started on metoprolol succinate 25mg daily for AVNRT, titrate 
as appropriate.
[] Repeat ___ ___ for follow-up of aortic root dilation and 
valvular heart disease.
[] Needs MRI Liver - RUQUS read "Numerous heterogeneous, complex 
cysts with irregular borders and internal septations are seen 
within the liver, most notably including a dominant cyst within 
the right hepatic lobe measuring 10.8 x 11.0 x 7.8 cm and an 
adjacent cyst measuring 11.3 x 9.0 x 9.0 cm. Recommend dedicated

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
frequent episodes of lightheadedness and you fainted in ___, 
and the heart monitor you were wearing to look at your heart 
rhythm showed that you had a concerning irregular heart rhythm.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
-You had a pacemaker inserted, which will help control your 
heart rhythm. This will prevent your heart from beating too 
slowly.
-You were started on a medication (Metoprolol) to help control 
your heart rate.
-You had an ultrasound of your liver, which showed cysts that 
need to be further evaluated with an MRI within 3 months. We 
will let your primary care doctor know about this, but you 
should discuss this with her as well. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
-Continue to take all of your medications as prescribed.
