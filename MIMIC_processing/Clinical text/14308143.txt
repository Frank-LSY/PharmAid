Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
R pleural effusion 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a pleasant ___ woman with HTN, HLD and recently
diagnosed metastatic breast cancer who presented originally to
the ED 2 days prior for drainage of a located R pleural effusion
- found to have 1 colony GPC growing from pleural fluid and now
representing for empiric antibiotics. 

She reports that a week ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer
on diagnostic mammography after she noted a lump in her R 
breast,
found to be metastatic on output CT which showed both lung and
abdominal involvement. On this CT scan, she was also noted with 
a
R located pleural effusion and was advised by her new oncologist
Dr. ___ at ___ (___) to present to the ED for
thoracentesis. She came to the ___ ED on ___ and underwent
R-sided thoracentesis with 800cc of fluid drained and was
discharged home. Her pleural fluid cultures were significant for
1 colony of GPC on 1 plate and so she was called back to ED per
Dr. ___ for IV antibiotics. 

Since the procedure, she reports some wheezing and mild chest
pain at the site of the thoracentesis - but with no other
symptoms. She does report a cough ongoing for the past ___ 
months
that has been stable with production of clear phlegm. She denies
any fever/chills or malaise. Other than feeling mildly anxious
and overwhelmed by her recent cancer diagnosis she has been
feeling generally well. Denies any chest pain, SOB, abdominal
pain, n/v/d, lightheadness/dizziness, 
numbness/weakness/tingling.

___ female who presents with abnormal labs and cough.
Patient presented to the ED 2 days ago with outpatient CT 
showing
loculated pleural effusion. 800 cc were removed here in the
emergency department sent for analysis. Patient was discharged
given close follow-up with oncology was arranged. Since the
procedure, she has been having some wheezing and pain at the
insertion site, otherwise no new symptoms. She has no fever,
chest pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain or malaise.

- In the ED, initial vitals were:
T97.8, HR 88, BP 127/86, 98% on RA 

- Exam was notable for:
General: no acute distress
HEENT: Normal oropharynx, no exudates/erythema
Cardiac: RRR , no chest tenderness
Pulmonary: Decreased breath sounds over the right lung. 
Insertion
site without evidence of drainage or surrounding erythema
Abdominal/GI: Normal bowel sounds, no tenderness or masses
Renal: No CVA tenderness
MSK: No deformities or signs of trauma, no focal deficits noted
Neuro: Sensation intact upper and lower extremities, strength 
___
upper and lower, stable gait, no focal deficits noted, moving 
all
extremities

- Labs were notable for:
BMP: WNL, Cr 0.6 
CBC: WNL 
Lactate: 0.7

Pleural fluid studies from ___: 
   WBC 2753, RBC ___, 2% Polys, 67% Lymphs,
   protein 5.2, glucose 96, LDH 598, maylase 8500, Albumin 3.3 
   gram stain: No PMNs seen
   culture: GPCs 

- Studies were notable for:
CXR pre-thoracentesis ___: No prior available for comparison.
Right base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion
and atelectasis and possible consolidation.Increased 
interstitial
markings diffusely bilaterally could represent
lymphangitic carcinomatosis. A prior study would be helpful for
comparison.

CXR ___: 
Right base consolidation, worrisome for pneumonia, with possible
small right
pleural effusion. Background of numerous subcentimeter pulmonary
nodules is
again seen.

- The patient was given: 
IV vancomycin 1g 

Vitals prior to transfer: T98, HR 96, BP 97/70, 99% RA 

On arrival to the floor, patient reports the above. She 
continues
to have mild coughing with phlegm production but denies any CP 
or
SOB. Denies any new fever/chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
======================
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with HTN, HLD and recently diagnosed 
metastatic breast cancer who presented originally to the ED 2 
days prior to admission for drainage of a loculated R pleural 
effusion. She was found to have 1 colony of GPCs growing from 
pleural fluid and was sent to the emergency department for 
further evaluation. While in the emergency department she 
received 1 dose of vancomycin to treat potential infection. She 
also underwent chest x-ray revealing a residual small 
right-sided pleural effusion with possible lower lobe 
opacification. On further review of prior imaging opacities seen 
at right base were felt to represent collapse in the setting of 
metastases which had been previously visualized on CT imaging. 
Culture from pleural fluid further speciated to 
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, felt to represent 
contaminant. Antibiotics were discontinued. Patient remained 
afebrile throughout admission, had no complaints, lab testing 
without evidence of systemic infection. She was felt safe to 
discharge home with close follow-up.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================== 
-Follow-up final pleural fluid culture and blood cultures

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#R pleural effusion
#Pleural fluid cx with GPC 1 colony on 1 plate 
Pt noted to have loculated R pleural effusion on CT A/P as part 
of her breast cancer workup and recommended by her oncologist to 
present to ED for drainage. Now s/p R thoracentesis of 800cc on 
___ in the ED, called back for admission given GPC noted on  
pleural fluid culture. Repeat CXR w/ concern for possible 
R-sided PNA. Effusion exudative by Light's criteria. Ddx 
includes malignancy vs lymphatic obstruction vs infection. 
Lymphocyte predominance on fluid studies more suggestive of 
malignancy. Less likely infectious given low PMNs, normal 
glucose, normal gram
stain. GPCs ultimately speciated out to coagulase-negative 
Staphylococcus only growing 1 colony on 1 plate. With no other 
evidence of systemic infection including no fever/chills or 
white count this is felt to most likely represent a contaminant 
not requiring antibiotic treatment. 

#Metastatic breast cancer
Recent diagnosis - established care with Dr. ___ at ___ 
___ on ___. Low ER/PR positive, HER2 negative - felt 
effectively to be triple negative. Pathology report currently 
pending. Awaiting MRI spine to better characterize possible bony
met. Oncologist planning on getting biopsy of metastatic site in 
order to confirm triple-negative, with chemotherapy plan pending 
this. Oncologist also looking into clinical trials at ___. 
Conversation surrounding prognosis thus far per oncology note is 
that disease is considered incurable at this time, treatment is 
with palliative intent with possible partial remission with 
prognosis of many months to possible years. Primary team touch 
base with oncology team prior to patient's discharge from 
hospital. They will arrange for follow-up upon her leaving the 
hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear MS. ___,

It was a privilege taking care of you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
===================================
-You are admitted to the hospital because there was concern that 
there was infection in the fluid that they drained from your 
lung recently

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
==========================================
-You received 1 dose of antibiotics in the emergency department 
to treat this possible infection.  
-The bacteria that was seen growing in the fluid from your lungs 
came back from the lab consistent with most likely a 
contamination from the needle passing through you skin and not a 
true infection
You are not having any fevers, were feeling well, and your labs 
did not show any evidence of ongoing infection so were felt safe 
to go home

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
============================================  
- Please continue to take all your medications and follow up 
with your doctors at your ___ appointments.  

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Care Team
