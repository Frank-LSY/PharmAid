History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with no significant past
medical history who presents to ___ with a headache, not
sleeping well, nausea and complaints of a parasitic infection.
History is taken from the patient herself. She reports having
been in her usual state of health until a few weeks ago, when 
she
started to be constipated with abdominal pain and distension as
well as back pain. At that time she saw her PCP, whose name and
office location she cannot remember, where stool studies were
sent off. She notes at this time having a positive stool test 
for
Iodamoeba butschii (has a photo of this name written down). 
After
being constipated she took a Dulcolax and then had diarrhea
briefly. Her friend then suggested she do a cleanse and she has
been doing that for the last 2 weeks, but having solid brown
stool. No associated fever or chills, no recent travel, no sick
contacts. She notes she can "see them" in her stool, meaning the
parasites, but cannot give much of a description. After her
abdominal and back pain got better she started having joint
paints in her hands/shoulders/fingers, feeling very tense and
unable to sleep. 

The main reason for her visit to the ED last night was headache,
rated ___. This was accompanied by nausea and dizziness,
described as the worst headache of her life. She did not take
anything at home and notes that the headache was quite severe
when she was at work. She has no associated vomiting, auras or
preceding symptoms. Notes the headache to be in the front of her
head on both sides, and she reports "my brain was so hot",
"inside my head was so hot and I felt something moving and it 
bit
me". By the time of evaluation on the medical floor her headache
is improved after receiving medication in the emergency
department. 

Associated symptoms/facts include 6 pounds of weight loss
(preceding her cleanse), complaints of noticing linear
excoriations on her skin in the last few weeks, and a history of
abnormal liver enzymes a few weeks ago. She denies fever,
vomiting, diarrhea except for the one time after taking 
Dulcolax,
sick contacts, recent travel. Does not feel bloated currently.
Denies joint/back/abdominal pain at the present time. Headache 
is
present but improved, no nausea at the time of evaluation.

paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  
The visualized
portion of the orbits are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial abnormalities identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx of Depression and remote hx of parasitic infection 
in ___ who presents to ___ with multiple complaints 
including HA, rash and concern for parasitic infection

#Headache/Scalp discomfort:
Pt reported intermittent HA for several weeks and CT head 
unremarkable.  HA was treated supportively in the ED with some 
improvement.   While inpt, pt described the headache as bumps 
under scalp that move around, get warm and tight, as though the 
worms are moving underneath them.   On exam, there was no 
evidence of skin changes, bumps, nodules. or irritation. 

#Concern for Parasitic infection, possible fixed delusion given 
lack of evidence to confirm it:
Pt reports an atypical constellation of symptoms including 
constipation, LH, intermittent right sided warmth, transient 
rashes and concern for worms in her stools. She showed me many 
pictures of her stools that she felt were consistent with worms. 
 She describes seeing many doctors over the month of ___ 
since the symptoms began and completed a course of Albendazole 
which did not resolve her symptoms.   She decided to try a 
"paracleanse" purchased at a naturalpathy store that gave her 
the most relief, as though she was passing the worms in her 
stools.  I tried to reach out to the physician who prescribed 
the Albendazole but did not hear back from him. Pt reports that 
she does not want to return to him anyway because he did not 
help.   Pt was seen by infectious disease consult team during 
the admission who also felt that her symptoms were not 
consistent with a parasitic infection.  I spent time trying to 
understand her commitment to this diagnosis.  She did endorse 
some symptoms of depression with poor sleep and weight loss but 
attributes these to the infection.   When I tried to offer 
psychiatry or SW support while we are evaluating her symptoms, 
pt declined and reports that she is not depressed or anxious 
currently.  She does endorse a history of depression but it all 
resolved when she went on a gluten free diet a few years ago.  
She reports that her sister who is nurse is willing to help and 
she intends to keep her follow up appointments next week with ID 
and her new primary care physician.   She felt that she would be 
more comfortable at home where she has more gluten free options 
and intends to return to work.  

Transition issues:
- f/u stool cultures 
- will share information/data from previous provider with new 
PCP when it is available.
