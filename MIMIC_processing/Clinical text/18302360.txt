-----------
Imaging: 
NCHCT:
No acute intracranial abnormality.

Lenis:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins.

CT Myelogram: 
1. Myelogram with intrathecal administration of Isovue 200 M at 
L4-L5.  Please refer to separate dictation of CT lumbar spine 
for spine findings. 
I, Dr. ___ supervised the trainee during the key 
components of the above procedure and I reviewed and agree with 
the trainee's findings and dictation. 

CT L Spine: 
1. Lumbar spine dextroscoliosis, and transitional anatomy with 
partial 
lumbarization of S1. 
2. Multilevel multifactorial degenerative disease of the lumbar 
spine as 
described, most pronounced at L3-L4 and L4-L5, where there is 
moderate right 
and moderate left neural foramen narrowing respectively, as 
described above. 
3. Partially imaged multiple left renal calcifications without 
definite 
evidence of hydronephrosis may represent nonobstructive renal 
calculi.  If 
clinically indicated, consider renal ultrasound further 
evaluation. 

Arterial US: 
No evidence of arterial insufficiency in the lower extremities. 

EMG 
Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are 
suggestive of a subacute left sciatic neuropathy; the severity 
of this is difficult to 
ascertain with confidence given the early timing of the study in 
relation to symptom onset, confounded by poor activation on 
needle EMG. The absence of the left sural response may be 
related to recent local surgery of the ___ muscle, further 
complicating localization; the possibility of a subacute left 
L5-S1 radiculopathy cannot be excluded. Follow up study may be 
helpful if clinically indicated.  

CT Left ___ (preliminary read): 
1. No mass lesions concerning for sciatic compression   
2. Mild diverticulosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted for Left foot numbness and weakness. Her workup 
was extensive. She had a negative lower extremity ultrasound for 
DVT or for peripheral artery disease, CT Myelogram notable for 
moderate R L3-L4 and L L4-5 narrowing. Of note,  Vascular 
consulted for concern L leg was cold, mottled in setting of 
recent procedure. Vascular determined since she has palpable 
ankle pulses; her arterial Doppler study shows normal pressures 
and waveforms; negative Lenis, She therefore had no evidence of 
vascular disease by exam and non-invasive testing. She had an 
EMG, which was a complex and abnormal study. The conclusion was 
that she had subacute sciatic neuropathy complicated by post 
surgerical changes from Left talonavicular arthrodesis. To rule 
out sciatic nerve compression by structural cause, she had a CT 
of left lower extremity, and no mass lesion was identified. An 
MRI of the Left lower extremity was considered, but her cervical 
spine stimulator is not MRI compatible. ___ OT recommended 
outpatient ___. She was discharged home with outpatient ___ and 
outpatient neurology followup. 

Transitional Issues:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted with left leg weakness and numbness. US of the 
extremity showed no clots in your veins and showed normal 
functioning of your arteries. You had a myelogram that showed 
narrowing at the outlet of one of the nerves that supplies your 
leg. Your EMG showed subacute sciatica complicated by 
post-surgical changes. Your CT scan of your leg did not show any 
structural signs of compression. Your sciatica will improve with 
time and physical therapy. Physical therapy recommended 
outpatient physical therapy.
