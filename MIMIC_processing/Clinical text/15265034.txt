REPORTS:
TEE CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is markedly enlarged. There is no
evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg.
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal 
cavity size. There is normal regional and global
left ventricular systolic function. No thrombus or mass is seen 
in the left ventricle. Quantitative biplane left
ventricular ejection fraction is 65 % (normal 54-73%). There is 
no resting left ventricular outflow tract
gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with normal 
free wall motion. The aortic sinus is mildly dilated
with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic arch diameter is 
normal with a normal descending aorta
diameter. There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is trace 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets
are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No definite left ventricular or atrial thrombi 
identified. Normal left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function. 
Mild right ventricular cavity dilation
with normal systolic function. Mild to moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
RECOMMEND: Of note, a transthoracic echocardiogram cannot 
exclude presence of thrombus in the
left atrial appendage, which would
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of afib on Pradaxa is transferred from OSH for 
management of his acute left iliac artery occlusion. 

 
Patient was started on a heparin infusion and brought to the 
operating room for exploration and angigram given the acute limb 
ischemia. A LLE angiogram was performed followed by left 
iliofemoral embolectomy.  Vascular medicine was consulted who 
recommended a transthoracic echocardiogram.  This ECHO can not 
exclude the presence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage 
but no further workup was needed. Additionally, they recommend 
changing pradaxa to eliquis for anticoagulation. 

Medications for chronic medical conditions were continued 
thoughout hospitalization. 

Lifelong anticoagulation for AF is indicated. 
Dabigatran(pradaxa) was changed to apixaban(eliquis). Aspirin 
and statin for vascular disease is also recommended. On the day 
of discharge, he was ambulatory ad lib, pain free , tolerating 
regular diet and voiding QS. 
We have arranged follow up  with PCP ___ ___ days and Dr. ___ 
in 1 month.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, 
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital for workup of 
your sudden onset of left lower pain.   We found a clot in the 
artery was the cause of the pain.  We removed the clot in the 
operating room.  after a peripheral angiogram.   To remove the 
clot, a small incision was made in one of your arteries.  The 
area heals on its own: there are no stitches to remove.  We feel 
this clot was from missing pradaxa doses in combination with 
your atrial fibrillation.   You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now ready to be discharged from the hospital.   Please 
follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and 
uneventful recovery.
