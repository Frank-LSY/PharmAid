History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a pleasant right-handed ___ man with 
___ Syndrome (migraine-like headaches, focal neurologic 
deficits, and CSF abnormalities) on verapamil and ?sarcoid 
presents with subacute left hand/arm/ear numbness. He was sent 
in by Dr. ___ evaluation. 

He was last seen by Dr. ___ on ___ for follow-up of 
___ Syndrome with visual symptoms. He initially presented 
___ with visual symptoms that occurred more than 
several times per day. He also had blinding headaches when he 
was young between ages ___, which has since subsided. There 
was also a question of sarcoid in his late ___ but he did not 
have any treatment. ?repeat workup did not show anything in his 
lungs. Had several of these episodes even before presentation in 
his late ___ while traveling to ___. This 
responded to verapamil, and symptoms subsided for ___ months. 
They came back in two forms: 

1. Speck that starts out on the left and grows in an arc-like 
fashion (like the ___ logo) over to the left in a prismatic 
fashion, expands, then flutters and blocks out L sided vision, 
occur once per week sometimes followed by headache, last 
___
2. R eye visual changes where he gets flickering linear light, 
lasts ___, like he is being blinded by bright areas vs like 
when one stands up too quickly, but this is not associated with 
position change
3. L ear, torso, L arm numbness/clumsiness that did stop with 
verapamil but is now back and progressively getting worse

On exam in ___, there was no visual field defect, cranial 
nerves intact, +clumsiness in L arm and RAM/slowness in finger 
to nose movements, LUE reflexes brisker than R. He had stopped 
the verapamil prior to this visit and restarted it at 240mg with 
ASA 325mg afterwards. He did not start the aspirin but has been 
taking the verapamil.

He presents today because the numbness in his left arm has been 
progressively getting worse since his MRI at ___ 
___ two weeks ago. This was reviewed by Dr. ___ told 
the patient that there were more lesions seen. Initially, his 
numbness only involved his middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Now 
it involves both his index finger and thumb. The numbness is 
circumferential and constant, and his dexterity is also 
diminished. He is having trouble tying his ties and buttoning 
shirts. He has not slept on his left arm or left it in one 
position over a long period of time, no trauma to the arm. 

He also reports the left side of his lips tingling like they are 
about to go numb but are not numb yet. Left ear is numb as is 
the area behind his left ear, neck is spared. He also reports 
that he could be looking for something on his left but is unable 
to see it but knows it is there because he would turn his head 
more so he could see it with his right eye immediately. It is 
like the sensation of knowing something is there but unable to 
see it. Has baseline spot in his left eye that he cannot see.

___
1. Late acute to subacute infarcts superimposed on chronic 
infarcts in the right perrolandic region.  No acute hemorrhagic 
transformation.  Given repeated infarcts within this region 
dating back to ___, embolic source is considered highly 
unlikely.  This may represent inflammatory etiology or 
potentially migrainous component although this typically affects 
the posterior circulation.  Vasculitis and vasospasm is 
consideration although as noted below MRA of the head and neck 
is unremarkable.  No evidence of vascular malformation. 
2. Unremarkable head and neck MRA. 

___
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. No 
ASD, PFO or LV thrombus seen.  

___ C-Spine w/ and w/o
1. No abnormal cord signal on pre or postcontrast images. 
2. Multilevel degenerative changes, worst at C6-7 where 
posterior disc bulge 
more prominent on the right causes mild canal narrowing and 
moderate right 
neural foraminal narrowing.  There is also moderate left neural 
foraminal 
narrowing. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a ___ man who presented with subacute LUE numbness and 
decreased coordination that has been worsening recently; 
admitted for expedited workup to Stroke Service. He was 
monitored on telemetry and continued on his home Verapamil and 
Aspirin therapy. He underwent MRI/MRA Brain which showed 
subacute on chronic infarcts in R perirolandic and watershed 
region between PCA and MCA of unclear origin, similar to 
infarcts seen on previous MRIs and suggesting a predilection for 
ischemia in these areas over a span of time. Echocardiogram was 
performed without abnormalities. Patient also underwent MRI 
C-Spine with some minor cervical spondylosis but no acute 
findings. He underwent lumbar puncture on ___ with no 
pleocytosis seen on basic CSF studies and other studies pending 
at time of discharge. Prior to discharge, his home Verapamil was 
increased from 240mg to 360mg for attempt at better control of 
potential vasospasm producing pt's infarcts and resultant 
symptoms. He was started on low dose statin due to slightly 
elevated LDL>100 seen on vascular risk factor workup. He 
appeared clinically stable throughout admission and was 
discharged home the same day due to pt not wanting to stay in 
the hospital for further diagnostic and therapeutic 
intervention.

Transition Issues:
-Pt will need to follow up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ in 
near future; at that time, CSF LDH, cytology, flow cytometry, 
and ACE should be noted 
-Pt should continue on new Atorvastatin 20mg qpm and increased 
dose of Verapamil at 360mg daily; he should continue on Aspirin 
daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted for progressive numbness and incoordination of 
your left hand. An MRI shows evidence of multiple prior lesions 
suspicious for stroke on the right side of the brain. The reason 
for these lesions is unclear, though we performed a lumbar 
puncture to try to better understand your diagnosis. We will 
communicate the results of these tests to your outpatient 
neurologist.

We have increased your verapamil to try to address your visual 
symptoms and may spasm of the blood vessels less likely. We also 
recommend starting aspirin and a statin to decrease your risk of 
stroke.

It was a pleasure caring for you,
___ Neurology team
