Service: NEUROLOGY
 
Allergies: 
Penicillins
 
Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Transient L sided weakness/aphasia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old R-handed M w/ PMH of HTN, DMII, and OSA
who presents with transient aphasia and weakness.

Pt reports sitting in his recliner in living room at noon today
when developed acute onset of L face/arm/leg weakness, 
dysarthria
and expressive aphasia. Associated with headache ___, 
bifrontal,
aching. Symptoms lasted for 5 minutes before self-resolving. 
After
resolution, wife called EMS and pt was brought to ___ 
for
evaluation. Upon arrival was seen to have SBP in 170s. While
there, he was seen to have 3 further events of similar semiology
(when asked about sx, pt states "all the same"), lasting for 12
to 22 minutes. After these recurrent events pt was given 
Aggrenox
once. Pt says he feels like medication "stopped" his events.
However, en route to ___ for further neurologic evaluation, he
reports having had 2 events of some slurred speech ___ lasting 
2
minutes, ___ lasting 1 minute), "stumble", "my face mumbles".

No clear triggers such as positional changes or exertion. No
recent infectious symptoms. 
 
Of note, pt had similar sx on ___ following which he was
admitted to ___ for TIA w/u until ___. Upon arrival to
OSH ED for that initial event (reported to last 2 minutes), pt's
BP was up to 240/130. Workup included CTA which was negative and
MRI with punctate infarct in R cerebellar hemisphere, likely
unrelated, as well as Various microhemorrhages of unclear
etiology. TTE w/ bubble study was negative. During admission, 
per
Neuro recs, pt was started on ASA and Atorvastatin 80mg. Based 
on
apparent hypertensive issues, his BP meds were adjusted.
Following discharge, pt saw his PCP where he was noted to still
be hypertensive despite change in regimen but improved. Pt also
had a similar event on ___ while driving in his car which 
lasted
for 5 minutes, but did not undergo evaluation at that time. Pt
denies any clear triggers for these events such as positional
changes or exertion. No recent f/c, infectious sx, sick 
contacts,
or travel. Denies hx of similar events, strokes, or TIAs in 
past.
He admits to recent poor compliance with heart-healthy and
diabetic diet. Otherwise, notes he has been working a lot (>80
hrs) recently as a police officer. However, is adamant that he 
is
not too stressed out ("it is what it is"). 

Neurologic and General ROS negative except as noted above

MRI AND MRA BRAIN  ___
1. The previously noted punctate infarct in the left cerebellar 
hemisphere is
less well visualized on diffusion and T2 weighted imaging which 
suggests
evolution of acute infarction.
2. There is no evidence of new areas of infarction.
3. Areas of arterial narrowing seen in the V3 and V4 segments of 
the vertebral
arteries bilaterally as well as high-grade stenosis in the mid 
basilar artery.
Fetal origins of the PCAs bilateral.
4. Atherosclerotic changes of the carotid bulbs bilateral, but 
this is not
significant by NASCET criteria.

ECHO
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified. No definite structural 
cardiac source of embolism identified.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed male with a past medical 
history of HTN, DMII, and OSA who presented after developing 
acute onset of left face/arm/leg weakness, dysarthria, and 
expressive aphasia. Exam on admission was non-focal. During his 
hospitalization, he had several episodes of transient dysarthria 
and left hemibody weakness that resolved upon lying flat. His 
CTA demonstrated areas of arterial narrowing in the vertebral 
arteries as well as high-grade stenosis in the mid-basilar 
artery. His symptoms were likely due to hypoperfusion in the 
setting of vessel stenosis. An Echo was performed, and this did 
not demonstrate an atrial thrombus or PFO. A1c 8.5, LDL 65.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___  
___.

You were admitted to the hospital after having a episode of left 
side weakness and difficulty speaking. 

In the hospital, we took images of your brain that showed a 
narrowing in some of the arterial vessels (basilar artery, 
vertebral artery) of your brain. This may cause a decrease in 
the blood flow to your brain, particularly when you stand up.   

Your brain MRI demonstrated a small stroke in the back of your 
brain (cerebellum) that does not explain your symptoms. 
Additionally, you had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs or "baby 
strokes"). We have started you on clopidogrel (Plavix) for 
stroke prevention, and you should continue your home aspirin and 
atorvastatin. You will also take lisinopril 5mg and hold your 
other blood pressures temporarily. In the meantime, you need to 
measure your blood pressure at home. We are trying permissive 
hypertension (permissive high blood pressure) to improve the 
perfusion in your brain for the next two weeks. However, if your 
systolic blood pressure is more that 180, you should call at 
your PCP. After two weeks, if you are not having symptoms, your 
PCP should target ___ normal blood pressure.

When you leave the hospital, you should continue taking your 
medications as listed below and follow up with your primary care 

doctor.

Best wishes,

Your ___ team
