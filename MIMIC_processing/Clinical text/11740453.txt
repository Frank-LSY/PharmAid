History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old female with a complex past medical history 
including CVID (previously on IVIG, off x1 month because of 
insurance issues), recent Lyme infection (s/p 3 weeks of IV 
antibiotics), POTS (unclear how diagnosis was made),  
 narcolepsy with cataplexy per report, malnutrition, reported 
history of Babesia and Ehrlichia, chronic syncope with multiple 
head strikes, PTSD, who presents after a prolonged syncopal 
event at home.  
 
 At 4pm the was witnessed to become grey, eyes rolled back, and 
became flaccid while sitting at the table with her family. There 
were no seizure like movements. She reportedly was minimally 
responsive for roughly 15 minutes then EMS was called. Her 
mother was monitoring her respirations throughout this time, and 
she called EMS when the respirations were noted to be shallow. 
The patient has had frequent syncopes in the past (see below) 
but usually this prolonged. She does not recall today's events. 
Leading up to the event she has been feeling weak, with 
myalgias. She denies any URI symptoms or cough. No report of 
tongue biting or urinary/bowel incontinence.  
 The patient was brought to ___ and was noted to be ill 
appearing, hypotensive to the ___. After a period of time, the 
patient returned to her normal baseline with stable vitals. She 
denies any new pain (has chronic arthralgias), chest pain, 
shortness of breath, headaches.  
 
 Of note, she was admitted to ___ 3 weeks ago for syncope 
but left AMA. There she reported daily syncope over a long 
period of time. She said these events happen while she is 
changing  
 position mostly, but can also happen while she is lying down. 
She sometimes has "full body shaking" before the episodes. The 
circumstances of her POTS diagnosis are unclear. Poor PO intake 
were noted during the admission as was urinary retention. There 
was concern that her psychiatric illness confounded her 
presentation.  
 She previously received care at ___ and ___ (d/c'd 
in ___ after stay for physical rehab for Lyme). POTS was 
reportedly diagnosed at ___ based on orthostatic responses, no 
tilt-table testing done. She has been on IVIG for ___ years for 
CVID and low complement levels, apparently her multifocal 
symptoms and frequent infections responded to this treatment. 
She reportedly also had anti-neuronal ab titers to D1 and 
tubulin in the past. Her parents state that her functional 
status has declined significantly in the last 2 months since not 
receiving IVIG because of insurance issues. Her neurologist in 
___ is ___, ___.  
 What workup she has had is unclear as her care has been spread 
across multiple providers in multiple states. They do not think 
she has an echo, she had an MRI brain at ___, they are unsure of 
the results.  
 She has a therapist whom she sees regularly. Her mood has been 
normal, PTSD has not been active.  
 Of note, she has been prescribed multiple sedating meds 
including Xanax, valium, tizanidine, ambien which she takes 
intermittently. She denies overdosing on these.

Reports:
TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF = 67%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no 
left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal.  IMPRESSION: normal study 

EKG: SR, no concerning STT changes, QTc ___ year old female with a complex past medical history per 
report including CVID (previously on IVIG), Lyme infection (s/p 
3 weeks of IV antibiotics), POTS, narcolepsy with cataplexy, 
chronic syncope with multiple head strikes, PTSD, who presents 
after a prolonged syncopal event at home. 

Acute issues: 
#Syncope: Patient has a history of syncope, and has recently 
presented to ___ and BI-N (see d/c summary ___ from BI-N 
records). Prior to this presentation, patient was witnessed by 
parents to lose consciousness at home. She was found to be 
hypotensive by EMS to systolic BP in ___ and was initially 
brought to ___-N where she received IVF with improvement in BP 
and mental status. She was transferred to ___ due to complex 
medication history. Here, she was continued on IVF and was 
mentating well. EKG showed NSR, normal intervals, normal 
morphology. She was maintained on telemetry without arrhythmia. 
She had negative infectious work up including UCx, normal WBC 
(Blood Cx pending at time of discharge), negative CXR. She had 
negative orthostatic VS. She had normal TSH, normal cortisol, 
normal immunoglobulins (checked given history of CVID previously 
on IVIg - see below).  Her toxicology screen was positive for 
benzodiazepines, and review of medications revealed a number of 
sedating medications, including Xanax, Valium, Ambien, and 
tizanidine. Review of prior studies revealed negative EEG and 
MRI brain per report. Patient does carry a diagnosis of POTS, 
which has been previously diagnosed by tachycardia upon standing 
(no history of tilt table testing). Given this, she was 
monitored while walking for an extended period and remained 
normotensive with BP in 130s/90s with HR in low 100s. She was 
asymptomatic during this time. Given her improvement with IVF, 
it was felt that her loss of consciousness was ___ dehydration 
and orthostasis vs POTS vs sedating medications,  and she was 
discharged home after return to baseline. 

Chronic issues:
#?POTS: Patient has carried a diagnosis of POTS but has not had 
tilt table testing. It is possible that she has POTS, given 
exertional tachycardia to 100s during hospital course. 
Exertional tachycardia was initially suspected to be due to 
dehydration but persisted after IVF. Other factors contributing 
to tachycardia include deconditioning and medication effect from 
benzos or withdrawal. Patient was monitored while walking for an 
extended period and remained normotensive with BP in 130s/90s 
with HR in low 100s. She was asymptomatic during this time. Tilt 
table testing may be considered in the outpatient setting. 

#PTSD: patient has a history of PTSD per report, for which she 
takes alprazolam 6 mg TID PRN and diazepam 10 mg q8h PRN. 
Patient's tox screen was positive for benzodiazepines on 
admission, which was concerning given her loss of consciousness. 
Benzodiazepines were discontinued at discharge and may be 
restarted in a limited fashion by outside psych providers.  
  
#h/o insomnia: patient carries a history of insomnia for which 
she takes  Zolpidem ___ mg QHS and tizanidine ___ mg qHS. In 
discussion with Dr. ___, her insomnia is secondary to 
her chronic lyme disease (see below) for which she requires 
sleep aids. Ambien and tizanidine were initially held during 
hospital course due to a concern that her loss of consciousness 
was due to a combination of sedating medications. However, 
tachycardia during admission was also concerning for withdrawal, 
specifically from tizanidine, and so was re-added prior to 
discharge. Limiting sedating medications like ambien and 
tizanidine was emphasized with patient. 

#?history of cataplexy with narcolepsy: the history of this 
diagnosis was difficult to obtain from outside providers. 
However, patient does take Amphetamine-Dextroamphetamine 40 mg 
daily for this problem, and this medication may be contributing 
to her tachycardia which has heretofore been attributed to POTS. 
 Given that patient also takes significant sedating medications 
(ambien/tizanidine/benzos), there was a concern that adderall 
may not be necessary if sedating medications are limited. 

#h/o ?CVID: Patient carries a diagnosis of CVID and is currently 
followed by Dr. ___ in CT (phone ___. Records were 
obtained from Dr. ___ showed a history of low IgG in 
___ (IgG2 148 (nl 241-700), IgG4 0.4 (nl ___ and low 
complement C3 70 (nl 90-180), C4 15 (nl ___. Given this, she 
was  previously placed on IVIg with improvement in her fatigue 
per report. Per most recent office note ___, patient was 
recommended to receive IVIg 15g/day x4days every 4 weeks with a 
plan to re-evaluate in 6 months. However, patient's insurance 
was unable to cover continued IVIg beyond this. Patient's 
parents highly concerned about the lapse in IVIg therapy. 
However, during this admission, IgG, IgA, IgM were checked and 
were normal, and IVIg therapy was not pursued during this 
admission.

#H/o lyme disease: Patient carries a diagnosis of chronic lyme 
disease, having received IV ampicillin for this previously 
(unclear why not doxycyline or ceftriaxone). Her last positive 
lyme test was in ___ per outside report. Per discussion with 
Dr. ___ in ___ and Dr. ___ has also had 
positive testing for Babesia and Erhlichia and receives IVIg for 
the sequela of infections as well per report. Patient's family 
also reports that she receives "herbs" for her chronic lyme from 
Dr. ___. Patient was highly encouraged to limit medications 
to FDA approved therapy and avoid these herbs, which she takes 
daily, as they may be contributing to her current presentation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Full Code
- Patient is on a number of sedating medications, alprazolam, 
diazepam, and trazodone were held upon discharge given concern 
for oversedation and hypotension. Resuming these medications is 
deferred to her outpatient providers. From BI-N d/c summary 
___: "Per the PMP the patient has filled alprazolam 2mg 270 
tabs, diazepam 10mg 120 tabs, ambien 10mg 60 tabs and dronabinol 
2.5mg 90 tabs within the past month". Please limit polypharmacy 
in the outpatient setting and on future admissions.
- Patient's vitals consistent with POTS, however, has not 
completed tilt testing; please consider tilt table in the 
outpatient setting.
- Dr. ___ rehab doctor) will coordinate 
outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy to improve 
mobility
- Patient sees a number of provders: 2 PCPS Dr. ___ Dr. 
___ Dr. ___ medicine Dr. ___ in 
___, psychiatry Dr. ___ in ___ and others.  Please 
encourage more unified care as patient receives her medications 
from a variety of sources, which is concerning for polypharmacy. 
Future admissions would benefit from obtaining collateral from 
these providers as with this admission.
- Blood cultures pending at time of discharge
- Contact ___ (mother) Phone: ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were seen at ___ due to 
loss of consciousness. You received fluids, and your blood 
pressure remained normal. You had lab work done that showed that 
you have no infection in your blood or urine. Your chest xray 
showed no infection. You had normal thyroid studies, normal 
cortisol (stress hormone), and normal heart structure on your 
echocardiogram. You had normal orthostatic vital signs, which 
show that you are not dropping your blood pressures when you 
stand. We also checked your immunoglobulins which were normal. 
Your EKG and your telemetry cardiac monitoring showed no 
arrhythmia. 

The most important thing you can do is to stay very well 
hydrated, drinking plenty of water, minimizing 
tea/coffee/caffeine, and continuing to have adequate salt intake 
in your diet.

Please continue to take your adjusted medication regimen and 
follow up with the appointments we have arranged. Please discuss 
with your outpatient doctors about combining ___ like 
Xanax and valium; combinations of these can cause loss of 
consciousness and may be dangerous. 

Dr. ___ is aware that you are going home today and will be 
working to coordinate outpatient physical therapy and 
occupational therapy. Please follow up with the neurologist to 
coordinate tilt table testing and future medical therapy.

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you all the 
best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ care team
