TTE ___:
CONCLUSION:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is mildly 
enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal
defect by 2D/color Doppler. There is normal left ventricular 
wall thickness with a normal cavity size.
There is normal regional and global left ventricular systolic 
function. There is beat-to-beat variability in
the left ventricular contractility due to the irregular rhythm. 
The visually estimated left ventricular
ejection fraction is 60%. There is no resting left ventricular 
outflow tract gradient. Normal right
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. There is mild to moderate [___]
tricuspid regurgitation

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Acute right MCA infarcts, similar to CT. 
2. Probable small thrombosed vessel, versus cortical 
microhemorrhage. 
3. Indeterminate partially seen enlarged bilateral palatine 
tonsils, may be 
reactive, direct visualization recommended. 

 CTA HEAD AND CTA NECK ___
IMPRESSION:    
No significant change in the size of infarction involving the 
right caudate 
nucleus, putamen and corona radiata compared to prior MRI. No 
evidence of 
hemorrhagic transformation. 

 CTA HEAD AND CTA NECK ___
IMPRESSION:  
1. Findings consistent with acute right basal ganglia infarct, 
with penumbra. 
2. Significant narrowing right M1, M 2, likely from thrombus. 
3. 25% decrease in right MCA arborization. 
4. The remaining circle ___ arteries are patent. 
5. Normal neck CTA.  No ICA stenosis. 
6. Enlarged bilateral palatine tonsils, may be reactive, direct 
visualization 
recommended.  Few neck subcentimeter lymph nodes, likely 
reactive. 
7. Dental disease, see above. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female without past medical history who presented with 
left sided weakness found to have right M1 thrombus now s/p 
thrombectomy IIb reperfusion. 

#Acute ischemic infarct 
She presented with right gaze preference and left sided weakness 
and on imaging with partial occlusion of M1 right middle 
cerebral artery. NIHSS 9 on presentation. She was outside the 
window for tPA but underwent thrombectomy with tici IIb re 
perfusion. Exam post thrombectomy notable for left facial droop, 
left pronator drift and some 4 to 4+ range weakness of left 
lower extremity as well as unilateral asterixis of left arm and 
foot. NIHSS 4. Work-up notable for MRI with right putaminal 
infarct with involvement of small area of corona radiata. GRE 
showed likely thrombosed vessel. Given thrombus in large vessel, 
etiology likely cardioembolic in the setting of newly diagnosed 
atrial fibrillation. Stroke risk factors notable for A1c 5.5, 
LDL 70. She was started on apixiban 5 mg BID and atorvastatin 20 
mg daily. 

#Atrial fibrillation
This is a new diagnosis for her. She was briefly on dilt gtt in 
ICU overnight ___, but since HR<110 and hemodynamically stable. 
She was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg BID. Anticoagulation with 
apixiban 5 mg BID was initiated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of <> resulting from an 
ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a 
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  
 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Atrial fibrillation

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Apixaban 
- Metoprolol
- Atorvastatin

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden new weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
