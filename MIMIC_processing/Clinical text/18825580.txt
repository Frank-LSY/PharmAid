reportedly worsened. She was then broadened to ceftriaxone and

Since then her WBC and physical exam have resolved. She still 
has some mild erythema on her arm. 
She had an xray of her shoulder that was done to look for gas 
and was normal. 
She did not have any palpable collections on exam, so US was 
deferred. 

She was discharged on clindamycin and cefpodoxime to complete a 
7 day course. 

Patient received several liters of NS in the ED. All of her cell 
counts went down during hospital course. Her Hgb came down to 9
