IMAGING:
___ Imaging MRI CERVICAL, THORACIC,
1. There is a possible new T2 and STIR hyperintense lesion 
posteriorly on theleft than the medulla.
2. All the other lesions in the cervical and thoracic cord are 
unchanged.
3. Mild bilateral hydronephrosis which may be better evaluated 
with
ultrasound.
4. For brain findings please refer to the MRI brain report.

___ Imaging MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. Extensive supratentorial and infratentorial white matter 
lesions appear
fairly similar compared to most recent prior imaging in keeping 
with history of MS. ___ definite new lesions.  Some of these left 
lesions demonstrate mildly
elevated signal on diffusion-weighted images which is unchanged.
2. There is marked white matter volume loss.
3. The study is limited without administration of gadolinium.
4. For findings of the spinal cord please refer to the 
concurrent spine MR
report.
  
___BD & PELVIS W/O CON
Markedly enlarged fibroid uterus. Mild fullness of bilateral 
renal pelves may be related to mass effect from uterine 
fibroids. There is ___ evidence of urolithiasis or frank 
hydronephrosis.

___ Imaging RENAL U.S.
___ evidence of hydronephrosis.  Bladder is decompressed by a 
Foley.

___ Pelvic ultrasound, non obstetric: 
1. Fibroid uterus, also demonstrated on the CT examination from 
___.  The largest discrete fibroid measures 6.4 x 7.3 x 4.6 cm 
arising at the mid uterus.  A 5.3 cm calcified fibroid is also 
present.
2. ___ definite submucosal component is identified.  The 
endometrium is
distorted, but appears smooth in visualized portions, measuring 
up to 6 mm.
3. Normal ovaries.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with RRMS (diagnosed in 
___ after onset of tremor) who presented with 3 days urinary 
retention.  Patient found to have admission of creatinine of 9.2 
which quickly returned to baseline with placement of Foley 
catheter. Patient's examination was her reported baseline and 
remarkable for dysarthria, right sided intention tremor, and 
dysmetria that is present on both sides in upper and lower 
extremities (but worse on the right). MRI brain and spine was 
notable for a new lesion on the craniocervical junction as well 
as anterior spinal cord at T2, anterolateral spinal cord at T11 
that do not have a correlate from ___ images. The lesion 
most likely responsible for the urinary and bladder retention is 
at the craniocervical junction.  Patient received 
methylprednisone 1000 mg 5 day course.  Patient was discharged 
with a Foley catheter as she continued to not urinate and have 
retention of urine.  Patient will follow up with urology for 
removal and voiding trial.  Patient has appointment ___ to see 
Dr. ___ MS, specialists to follow up on this 
hospitalization. 

Patient had an ultrasound with uterine fibroids, however per 
OB/GYN, since they were stable since an ultrasound in ___, they 
are unlikely contributing to urinary obstruction. Patient has 
been scheduled for an appointment to discuss management options 
of these fibroids. 

Patient was discharged with ___ addition or change in her 
medication regimen. 
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Urology follow up for foley
[ ] Reschedule natalizumab injection 
[ ] Discuss MS management going forward and possible med changes

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ because of an episode of urinary and 
bowel retention and abdominal pain, which was likely a multiple 
sclerosis flare. 

While you were here, you had an MRI of your head and spine which 
showed new changes that could have caused your bladder 
retention. We placed a catheter to help drain the urine, and 
also put you on a 5 day course of steroids to help treat the 
flare. We tried to take out the foley and see if you could 
urinate on your own, but unfortunately you were not able to at 
the time. You will be going home with the foley in place so we 
are confident you are emptying your bladder, and you will have 
an appointment with a urologist to repeat a urination trial.

We also did an ultrasound of your pelvis and saw large uterine 
fibroids. However, these were unlikely related to your urinary 
retention as they have been stable from a prior ultrasound a few 
years ago. 

While you were in the hospital, we discontinued your home 
Magnesium because your blood magnesium levels were high. We did 
not change any of your other medications. You should continue to 
take all of your other home medications as prescribed, and 
should reschedule your monthly injection of natalizumab as you 
missed it while you were in the hospital. Please attend your 
next appointment with Dr. ___.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
