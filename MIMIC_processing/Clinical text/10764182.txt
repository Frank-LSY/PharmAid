individual, group, and milieu therapy, as well as continuing 
psychiatric medications and augmenting the dose of quetiapine.  
- Familial stressors, including being far from family, which was 
addressed with the assistance of patient's mother who actively 
participated in the stabilization of patient and aftercare 
planning.  Patient's mom will remain in ___ until the end of

Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including future-oriented viewpoint, sense of 
responsibility to family, reality testing ability, positive 
therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, no active 
substance abuse and strong familial supports.
