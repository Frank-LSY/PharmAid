Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital secondary to constipation and 
urinary retention. You had a Foley catheter placed and your 
urine output has been appropriate. You were given an aggressive 
bowel regimen and had several bowel movements. You are now ready 
to be discharged home. You will be taking a new medication 
called Flomax in order to help with urine output. You have a 
follow up appointment to have your Foley catheter removed. You 
are also placed on a bowel regimen in order to have regular 
bowel movements.

If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office 
for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing 
abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose 
stool, or extended constipation.

You will go home with a foley catheter in place. Please follow 
all care for this taught to you by the nursing staff. There 
should always be a small amount of clear yellow urine in the 
foley tubing. If urine suddenly stops draining or you have lower 
abdominal pain please call us. Alay secure the Foley catheter to 
the leg. Call if you have bloody urine. Call for fever over 101. 
You may shower, let the water run away from the area where the 
tube is inserted into the penis. 

It is expected that you will have pain after surgery and this 
pain will gradually improved over the first week or so you are 
home. You will especially have pain when changing positions and 
with movement. You should continue to take 2 Extra Strength 
Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock and you 
may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every hours for 7 days. 
Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or 
any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. Please take 
Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your 
pain to a point where you can ambulate and preform minor tasks, 
you should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication

with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a
