#STEMI
Patient presented with acute onset left-sided crushing chest 
pain with
nausea and vomiting that initially developed 0700 on ___. He 
presented to ED and was found to have anterolateral ST 
elevations on ECG and trop 0.11 consistent with STEMI. Taken to 
cath lab and found to have 100% occlusion of proximal to mid LAD 
now s/p one DES. Received 80cc of contrast and 672cc for 
post-cath hydration. Patient chest pain free and HD stable with 
no evidence of heart failure on exam except chronic trace ___ 
pitting edema which is chronic and thought to be in setting of 
amlodipine and venous insufficiency. Post PCI TTE demosntrated  
1) Moderate focal and mild global LV systolic dysfunction c/w 
mid LAD
myocardial infarction. 2) Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation 
in setting of mild pulmonary hypertension and normal RV systolic 
function.  EF 49%
Patient discharged on aspirin, ticagrelor a ($5 co-pay), 
rosuvastatin, metoprolol, home amlodipine, home losartan.

#Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Last A1c 9.4% (___). Nutrition consulted as inpatient. Home 
oral hypoglycemics were held in the hospital and the patient was 
placed on insulin sliding scale. Will need outpatient up 
titration of diabetes regimen for his glycemic control.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
-You came to the hospital because you had a heart attack

What happened while I was admitted to the hospital?
- Your heart arteries were examined (cardiac catheterization) 
which showed a blockage of one of the arteries. This was opened 
by placing a tube called a stent in the artery. You were given 
medications to prevent future blockages.  
- It is very important to take your aspirin and clopidogrel 
(also known as Plavix)/ticagrelor (also known as Brilinta) every 
day.  
- These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the 
heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart 
attack.  
- If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing 
a blood clot forming in your heart stents and having another 
heart attack  
- Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to 
your heart doctor.  
-Your lab numbers were closely monitored and you were given 
medications to treat your medical conditions

What should I do after I leave the hospital?
-Please continue taking all of your medications as prescribed, 
details below
-Keep all of your appointments as scheduled 

We wish you the very best!
