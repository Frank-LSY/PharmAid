History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ LH F w PMHx of prolactimona s/p 
resection
___ ago and "borderline" hypertension (no medications) who
presents with acute onset left arm weakness and clumsiness. Ms.
___ reports that she was cooking short ribs this afternoon and
when she went to go flip the ribs (at ~14:45), she noticed that
she was having more difficulty than she would have expected (she
makes a supinating motion to demonstrate). Her husband was with
her in the kitchen and reports that aside from Ms. ___
appearing "anxious," he did not notice any other abnormalities
(no speech difficulty, no confusion, no facial droop, no 
abnormal
movements). Ms. ___ found the episode concerning and called 
her
PCP to schedule on urgent visit. 

Before leaving the house, she went upstairs to brush her teeth
and at that time noticed a great deal of left hand clumsiness.
She states that she felt like she was having more difficulty 
with
"fine motor" tasks and denied frank weakness. She drove herself
to her PCP. An exam there was normal, but V3 ST elevations were
seen on an EKG and she was transferred to ___ ED for further
evaluation.

In the ED, she reports that her symptoms while somewhat vague 
and
difficult to describe, have not fully resolved. She states that
when signing a form in the ED, she still felt that her left hand
was clumsy. Overall, though, it is difficult for her to trend 
her
symptoms as they are only provoked by specific movements and
tasks. She does state that her symptoms now seem to consist for
of "clumsiness" than weakness. She denies any sensory 
alterations
associated with her clumsiness.

Ms. ___ reports that prior to this episode, she was in her
usual state of health. In the hours before the episode, she and
her husband had been outside chopping ice and shoveling snow -
she did not notice any weakness or clumsiness at that time.

blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech. Denies leg or face weakness, numbness, or
other sensory alterations. parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of weakness and left arm 
clumsiness resulting from a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a 
condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is temporarily blocked by a clot. Damage to the 
brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a 
variety of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- "borderline" hypertension  

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- START aspirin 81mg daily 
- START lisinopril 5mg daily 
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)  
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision  
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)  
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)  
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake  
It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.
