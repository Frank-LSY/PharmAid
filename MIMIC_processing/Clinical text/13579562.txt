Discharge Instructions:
Remember, these are some of the potential risks of TURP surgery:
Problems with sexual performance
Ejaculation into the bladder (retrograde ejaculation) is very 
common. It occurs in about 25 to 99 men out of 100.This does not 
affect sexual function. 
Men who have TURP appear to have no greater risk for erection 
problems than men who do not have surgery. For men who do have 
trouble getting an erection, medicine can help. 
Loss of ability to control urine flow (incontinence)
A small number of men (about 1 out of 100) say they are 
completely unable to hold back their urine after the surgery. 
But some experts say that men who have TURP appear to have no 
greater risk for incontinence than men who do not have surgery.
You may have a catheter. The catheter enters through the tip 
of your penis and goes into your bladder to drain your urine 
into a collection bag. The catheter is generally left in place 
for four to seven days, until you're able to urinate on your 
own. In some cases, a catheter is needed for a longer period of 
time  especially if you have a relatively large prostate. You 
may urinate around the catheter, which is normal because your 
bladder may try and squeeze out more urine than the catheter can 
accommodate. 
Urination may be painful. You may have a sense of urgency as 
urine passes over the surgical area. You may also need to 
urinate frequently. Painful urination generally improves in one 
to four weeks. 
You may see blood in your urine. This is common right after 
surgery. If you have clots or so much blood in your urine that 
you can't see through it, contact your doctor. 
These steps can help you recover after your procedure. 
Drink plenty of water to flush out the bladder. 
Avoid straining during a bowel movement. Eat fiber-containing 
foods and avoid foods that can cause constipation. Ask your 
doctor if you should take a laxative if you do become 
constipated. 
Don't take blood-thinning medications until your doctor says 
it's OK. 
Don't do any strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 
four to six weeks or until your doctor says it's OK. 
Don't have sex. You'll likely be able to resume sexual 
activity in about four to six weeks. 
Don't drive until your doctor says it's OK. ___, you can 
drive once your catheter is removed and you're no longer taking 
prescription pain medications. 
 
-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You 
should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.  

Should you HOLD ASPIRIN? Unless otherwise advised;  If the urine 
is still pink, hold the aspirin until it has been clear/yellow 
for at least three days. 

-If prescribed; complete the full course of antibiotics.

-You may be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM 
that will help with the "burning" pain you may experience when 
voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.

-Colace has been prescribed to avoid post surgical constipation 
and constipation related to narcotic pain medication. 
Discontinue if loose stool or diarrhea develops. Colace is a 
stool softener, NOT a laxative

- AVOID STRAINING for bowel movements as this may stir up 
bleeding.

-Do not eat constipating foods for ___ weeks, drink plenty of 
fluids to keep hydrated

-No vigorous physical activity or sports for 4 weeks or until 
otherwise advised

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) or 
participate in high intensity physical activity for a minimum of 
four weeks or until you are cleared by your Urologist in 
follow-up

-Tylenol should be your first line pain medication, a narcotic 
pain medication has been prescribed for breakthrough pain >4. 
Replace Tylenol with narcotic pain medication.

-Max daily Tylenol (acetaminophen) dose is 4 grams from ALL 
sources, note that narcotic pain medication also contains 
Tylenol

-Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do not 
operate dangerous machinery. Also, if the Foley catheter and Leg 
Bag are in place--Do NOT drive (you may be a passenger).

WHEN YOU ARE DISCHARGED WITH A FOLEY CATHETER:
-Please also reference the nursing handout and instructions on 
routine care and hygiene

-Your Foley should be secured to the catheter secure on your 
thigh at ALL times until your follow up with the surgeon.

-DO NOT have anyone else other than your Surgeon or your 
surgeon's representative remove your Foley for any reason.

-Wear Large Foley bag for majority of time; the leg bag is only 
for short-term periods for when leaving the house.

-Do NOT drive if you have a Foley in place (for your safety)
