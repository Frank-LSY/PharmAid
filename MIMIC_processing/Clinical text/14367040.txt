Pertinent Results:
___ 10:59AM   HGB-12.2 calcHCT-37
___ 10:59AM   GLUCOSE-98 LACTATE-1.0 NA+-142 K+-3.8 CL--101

___ CXR :
1. Interval right lung wedge resection and with a small right 
apical 
pneumothorax. 
2. Similar severe hyperexpansion. 
  
___ CXR :
 Tiny right apical pneumothorax is smaller.  Right chest wall 
subcutaneous 
emphysema is grossly unchanged.  Cardiac size top-normal.  The 
lungs are 
hyperinflated.  Postoperative changes in the right upper lobe 
are noted.  
Increasing opacities in the right lower lobe are likely 
atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on 
___ and underwent right VATS wedge resection. The procedure 
was uncomplicated, please see the operative note for more 
details. A chest tube was placed at the end of the procedure. 
After an uneventful stay in the post-anesthesia care unit, she 
was transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically stable. 
Supplemental oxygen was weaned as tolerated, but she continued 
to need 1L NC overnight. Her electrolytes were monitored and 
repleted as necessary. She did not void the evening of ___ and 
required straight catheterization once, but was able to void 
without difficulty thereafter. 

On ___ the chest tube was removed and post-pull CXR was 
stable. However, she was noted to have desats on room air with 
ambulation and nursing expressed concerns about her stability to 
ambulate by herself. She stated that she had 17 steps into her 
apartment. She was evaluated by ___ on ___ who felt her ___ 
discharge disposition was to acute rehab to help increase her 
mobility and endurance.

She continued to use her incentive spirometer effectively but 
was unable to totally wean from oxygen. Her oxygen saturations 
were 97% at rest on 2 liters but with activity she would drop to 
the low 90's.  She will continue to wean slowly from oxygen and 
room air saturations of > 90% with activity are acceptable.  Her 
right port sites are healing well and her pain is controlled 
with Tramadol and Tylenol.

She was discharged to rehab on ___ and will follow up in 
the Thoracic Clinic in 2 weeks.
