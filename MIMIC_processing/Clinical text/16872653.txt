Brief Hospital Course:
# Stercoral colitis
# Opioid-induced constipation
- disempacted in ED
- initially refused enema, but once he was convinced to allow 
it, he subsequently had resolution of his constipation
- still with some abdominal soreness on discharge, expected as 
part of stercoral colitis
- advised patient re: continued use of Colace and PRN use of 
senna and miralax, and the crucial importance of these meds if 
he resumes using any narcotics (illicit or prescribed)
- advised patient to take PRN senna and miralax if he goes more 
than 1 day without BM, and to notify PCP if goes more than 3 
days without BM (for possible Rx for suppository or other PO 
bowel regimen)
- the patient has a severe lack of insight, no doubt exacerbated 
by ongoing substance use/abuse; he will benefit from repeated 
instructions and close follow-up
- advised patient/mother to make f/u appointment with PCP ___ ___ 
weeks
[] please f/u ongoing use of bowel regimen

# Opioid abuse/dependence & mild withdrawal
- using street-obtained Percocet, suboxone, and possibly others
- denies IVDU
- denies personal hx of overdose
- advised cessation
- SW consulted and provided resources
- patient declined direct transfer to voluntary dual dx 
treatment facility
- provided Rx for Narcan Nasal Spray Rescue Kit and educated 
patient and his mother that this is useful for opioid overdose, 
not for BZD overdose
[] please continue to encourage enrollment in dual dx treatment 
program (inpatient or outpatient)
[] please ensure patient/family continue to have access to 
Narcan rescue kit

# Benzodiazepine abuse/dependence & mild withdrawal

treatment facility
- CIWA monitored while inpatient, not significantly elevated

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with severe constipation 
resulting in inflammation of the colon (called "stercoral 
colitis"). This was caused by your ongoing use of opioids 
(including suboxone, Percocet, Oxycodone, etc.).  You underwent 
disempaction in the emergency department and received an enema 
with resolution of the constipation.

It would not be unusual to continue to have abdominal soreness 
for several days as the inflammation of your colon gradually 
resolves. 

As we discussed, it is very important that you do not allow 
yourself to go more than 2 days without having a bowel movement. 
 Please take the Colace each day as prescribed, and take the 
Senna and Miralax as prescribed for constipation.  If you resume 
using narcotics, you WILL develop constipation, and it will be 
very important to take these medications to prevent severe 
constipation.

As we discussed, your ongoing use of benzodiazepines (e.g. 
Xanax) and opioids (e.g. Percocet, Suboxone) puts you at risk of 
injury and death.  We had our social worker speak with you and 
provide you with resources for helping to quit and stay sober.  
We strongly encourage you to consider enrolling in one of the 
inpatient programs for treatment of substance abuse and bipolar 
disorder.

To help you quit smoking, we have prescribed you a nicotine 
patch and the nicotine lozenges. Use the patch during the day, 
take it off at bedtime.  Use the lozenges day or night as needed 
for cigarette cravings.  After 2 weeks of using the 14 mg patch, 
advance to the 7 mg patch. After 2 weeks of using the 7 mg 
patch, discontinue the patch and just use the lozenges as needed 
for cravings.

While you were in the hospital, we discussed your current 
situation with your primary psychiatrist, Dr. ___ he 
recommended resuming Depakote at a dose of 500 mg twice daily.  
Please see Dr. ___ in 1 week to have your Depakote level 
checked and potentially have your dose of Depakote adjusted.

We advise that you STOP taking Adderall 
(Amphetamine-Dextroamphetamine) until you are seen and 
re-evaluated by Dr. ___.

We wish you all the best.

Sincerely,
The ___ Medicine Team
