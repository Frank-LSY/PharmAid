Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY: 
The patient was admitted on a section 12b which expired on 
___ she later signed a conditional voluntary agreement on 
___. She was also placed on 15 minute checks status on 
admission and remained on that level of observation throughout 
while being unit restricted. She did not require physical or 
chemical restraints during this hospitalization. 
 
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Unspecified psychosis with catatonia [resolved]
On initial presentation to the ED, the patient demonstrated some 
signs suggestive of catatonia; she was minimally verbal, 
staring, with noted automatic obedience. She was treated with 
olanzapine and lorazepam. This was continued on the inpatient 
unit; once on the unit, the patient was observed to be more 
verbal and interactive, with lower suspicion for catatonia. 
Initial presentation was notable for the patient's ongoing 
paranoia and ideas of reference and subsequent anxiety regarding 
the existence of these symptoms, with notable exam findings of 
thought blocking, paranoia, and frequent episodes of crying that 
limited evaluation. 

It appears that this is her first episode of psychotic symptoms; 
there is no indication for prior substance use that could be 
contributing to this presentation. From a statistical 
standpoint, she is a high risk for recurrence of psychotic 
symptoms vs. a singular episode of psychosis. 

During initial days of hospitalization, she was noted to have 
quite reactive affect, frequently observed crying and appearing 
overwhelmed. 

Olanzapine and lorazepam were titrated on the inpatient unit, 
with moderate improvement in psychosis and anxiety symptoms. She 
appeared brighter, less thought-disordered, and less paranoid. 
She was more appropriate and did not appear as overwhelmed 
during latter parts of the hospital course. On days leading to 
discharge, Ms. ___ appeared quite organized, able to arrange 
appointments related to her work and her visa status, as well as 
find more information about the logistics of continuing care in 
___. 

Given her high risk of recurrence of psychotic symptoms, she 
will require continued outpatient follow-up and medication 
compliance. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Patient did not have history of substance use disorders

4. MEDICAL
#) There were no medical issues that arose during 
hospitalization. 
 
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU: 
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. She was a bit isolative, 
preferring to spend her time alone in her room, but was seen in 
the milieu at times. 

#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
The patients family [mother] was involved in the patients 
treatment and discharge planning, and was provided with the 
opportunity to discuss the patients diagnosis and treatment 
with the primary treatment team. The patients mother was 
supportive of the patients treatment and aftercare plan. She 
was in agreement to stay with her daughter from day of discharge 
until they were both able to take the same flight back to ___ 
in approximately one week. 
 
#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Olanzapine and Lorazepam 
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Follow-up in ___, 
involvement with patient's mother
- ___: Encouraged importance of continued 
aftercare planning
- Guardianships: Not applicable
 
INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting olanzapine and lorazepam, and risks and benefits of 
possible alternatives, including not taking the medication, with 
this patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take this medication as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any questions about medications with the treatment team.

Olanzapine [Zyprexa]
Benefits: Weight gain, Controlling agitation, mood 
stabilization, maintaining response in schizophrenia
Risks: Increased risk for diabetes, dizziness, sedation, 
orthostatic hypotension, tardive dyskinesia [rare], neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome [rare], seizures [rare]

Lorazepam [Ativan]
Benefits: decreased anxiety, decreased agitation, decreased 
sleep, tx of catatonia 
Risks: Headaches, confusion, ataxia, paradoxical excitement  
 
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
 
On presentation the patient was evaluated and felt to be unable 
to care for herself in the community due to her ongoing 
disorganized thinking, delusions, and erratic behavior. From a 
self-harm perspective, she denied suicidal ideation or homicidal 
ideation; however, her ongoing psychosis, medication 
non-compliance, and lack of outpatient treaters placed her at 
elevated risk of harm to self. 

During hospitalization, we addressed her psychosis and 
medication non-compliance by starting her on olanzapine and 
lorazepam in addition to psychotherapeutic interventions. We 
were able to assist the patient with arranging for aftercare in 
___ [though the patient will need to present in person 
to the clinics to set up a definitive appointment].  

Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including lack of suicidal ideation, good 
problem-solving skills, lack of substance use history, and sense 
of responsibility to her family.  Overall, the patient is not at 
an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others due 
to acutely decompensated psychiatric illness. Our prognosis of 
the patient is guarded; it is reassuring that the onset of her 
psychotic symptoms appears early enough that she still has a 
fair amount of insight and reality-testing, though she will need 
close follow-up, outpatient support, and continued 
medication-compliance to ensure her success on discharge. From a 
statistical standpoint, she is a high risk for recurrence of 
psychotic symptoms vs. a singular episode of psychosis.
