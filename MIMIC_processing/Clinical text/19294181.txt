INSTRUCTIONS AFTER HAND SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for hand surgery. It is normal to

should improve over the first few days to week. 
- Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow 
your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

MEDICATIONS:
  1)  Take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours around the clock. This is 
an over the counter medication.
  2)  Add  oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean

Take 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days, 
then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day,

narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must

the counter and may be obtained at any pharmacy.
