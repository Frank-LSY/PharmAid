History of Present Illness:
HPI: ___ with hx of HLD, BPH, GERD, C spine and L spine surgery, 
TIA here with R facial weakness, numbness, dysarthria starting 
2:50pm. NIHSS initially 3. 

Patient has been in his normal state of health until 2:50 today 
when driving to meet a client.  While in the car, he gradually 
noticed right periorbital numbness, like Novocain, that slowly 
extended up his jaw and up his face to around the level of his 
eye.  This progression happened over 50-20 minutes.  Throughout 
this he tried to speak and realized that his pronunciation was 
also off and that his S's and his efforts were unclear.  He 
called his outpatient doctor who arranged an urgent outpatient 
visit to see him and got to their office around 3:45 ___.  At 
that point he noticed a dull aching pain in his right temple as 
well as behind his right ear into the back of his head.  This 
headache lasted for several hours and resolved at around 530pm.

From the outpatient office was taken immediately to the nearby 
___ where code stroke was activated, noncontrast head CT 
was negative for bleed, ___ stroke scale reportedly 3 for 
sensory change in the right arm, dysarthria, right lower facial 
droop.  Tele-stroke was contacted and he received TPA at 5:02 
___.

On arrival to our ___, he reports that his speech has improved 
compared to before the TPA.  ___ stroke scale repeated above was 
3 for  right lower more than upper facial weakness, decreased 
sensation to light touch over the right jaw and right forearm, 
as well as very mild dysarthria.  On more detailed neurologic 
exam below the sensory change resolved and upon further 
questioning he reported that the difference in light touch over 
his right face and arm during the first NIHSS exam was 97% on 
the right versus 100% on the left.

Noncontrast head CT with no bleed,  possible small hypodensity 
on one cut in the pons, possibly artifact.  No large vessel 
occlusion/stenosis on CTA head and neck.

Throughout the ___ stay, from arrival to re-evaluation after the 
___, he has progressively more weakness of the R upper face in 
addition to the right lower face - manifested by blink rate, eye 
aperture 

Interestingly, he reports that recently both his mother and his 
brother developed ___ palsy.  He was also recently bitten on 
the tongue by his dog. 

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, hearing 
difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending 
speech.  Denies focal weakness. No bowel or bladder incontinence 
or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent illness, 
fever or chills.  Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies 
chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in 
bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.

and C5-6 are synthetic.  He believes the lumbar disc protrusion 
at L5.  
TIA Ã—2-the first ___ years ago during which he was pale and 
unsteady on his feet but had no focal neurologic symptoms and 
was told this was a TIA.  The second several years after that 
occurred when he was driving the client when his left arm and 
face went numb and heavy.  No residual deficits

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a pleasant ___ with HLD, BPH, GERD, C and L 
spine disc disease s/p surgery who was transferred to ___ 
after he received tPA for R facial weakness, numbness, 
dysarthria. He was last known well at 2:50pm ___. He was 
driving at the time when he noticed right perioral numbness. 
This slowly extended up his jaw into his eye. He then noticed a 
dull aching pain in his right temple as well as behind his right 
ear into the back of his head. This headache lasted for several 
hours and resolved at around 530pm. Went to ___ where 
___ initially 3. Code stroke called and risk and benefit 
discussion of tPA was performed. Pt elected to have tPA given, 
which was done without complication. He was transferred to ___ 
for higher level of care. Neuro exam now significant for only R 
upper and lower facial weakness with eye blink delay, eye 
closure weakness, forehead elevation asymmetry, not improving 
with emotional smile, mild dysarthria. This is consistent with a 
Bell's Palsy. ___ at OSH showed ?medial pontine hypodensity, 
but on re-evaluation this is likely artifact. 24hr post tPA scan 
did not show a hemorrhage. 

He was prescribed a steroid taper and Valtrex. Will also need to 
tape his eye shut at night. He was counseled on these and will 
need follow up with his PCP in the next ___ weeks.

Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized after you developed facial numbness and

adverse effects of tPA.
