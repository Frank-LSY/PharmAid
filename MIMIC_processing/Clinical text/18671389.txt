notes dated ___.

___ is a ___ year old man with reported history of
Bipolar Disorder and Anxiety who presents with worsening anxiety
and depressed mood with SI in the setting of non-adherence with
Quetiapine and Buspirone for the past several months.

On Deac4 admission interview patient reports worsening anxiety
over the past year resulting in losing his job working at an
___ and then subsequently quitting work as ___ due to overwhelming anxiety related to rude passengers. 
He has not been able to find other work and is homeless, staying
on people's couches and relying on financial generosity form
family and friends.  Over the summer he started "planning my
disappearance of sorts" in which he would cash in his 401k and
move to ___ without telling anyone.  This ultimately did
not work out and he remained in ___, but is still very 
unhappy
and comes up with other "escape plans" regarding spontaneously
moving to different countries.  Approximately ___ months ago he
decided to self-discontinue his psychiatric medications 
(Seroquel
and Buspar) "so that medications would not get in the way of
getting an accurate psychiatric diagnosis."

Over the past week he has come to the realization that none of
these "escape plans" are realistic which has caused him to feel
hopeless.  He reports worsening mood, low energy, poor sleep, a
desire to be completely isolated and "unbearable" anxiety.  He
states that there is a need he has that he cannot describe which
he is afraid will never be fulfilled.  He states he has been
suicidal on and off since age ___ but recently he has had
continuous thoughts of ending his own life with tentative plan 
to
jump off a bridge "and no one would ever know what happened to
me."  He states he formerly resisted suicide out of respect for
his family but now he is becoming increasingly distanced from
them and this is no longer as protective as it was before.  He
currently endorses passive SI without plan and states that he
will notify a staff member on the unit if this changes.  He
states he feels "cautiously hopeful" about being on the unit and
hopes to get better.

Patient makes several loose statements when attempting to
describe what he believes his psychiatric issues to be.  At one
point he states, "I have a weird relationship to knowledge and
information" but is unable to describe further what this means. 
He denies HI or AVH.  Reports a history of risky behaviors such
as shoplifting and prostitution however these were both done out
of need to obtain items or make money.

Patient was oriented to the unit and informed to contact staff
with questions or issues.

PSYCHIATRIC
#)Bipolar disorder I, current depressive episode
On admission, pt appears dysthymic, tearful and has somewhat 
labile affect. He endorses full neurovegetative symptoms, and 
passive suicidal ideations. He endorses significant anxiety 
associated with his depressive mood. Pt has self-stopped his 
outpatient psychiatric medication Seroquel and Buspar 2 months 
prior to his current admission. 
During hospitalization, he was started on Latuda 20mg qhs for 
bipolar depression treatment. It gradually titrated up to 60mg 
qhs.  Pt tolerated the treatment well, without side effects 
noted. He was given Buspar 15mg BID for anxiety. But since pt 
reports negative side effects from the Buspar, it was changed to 
Buspar 10mg PO TID PRN. He was also given hydroxyzine 25mg q6h 
PRN for anxiety. 
We also sought out ___ testing w/ our psychologist during pt's 
admission.  Results showed a high propensity for borderline 
personality.  Team also appreciated this clinically, as pt 
engaged in a lot of staff splitting.  Mr. ___ told us, 
however, that he did not think the borderline diagnosis fit him. 


On discharge, pt reports improved depressive mood and anxiety 
with the current medication regimen. He denies SI. 

Safety: The patient remained in good behavioral control 
throughout this hospitalization and did not require physical or 
chemical restraint. The patient remained on 15 minute checks, 
which is our lowest acuity level of checks.

#RISK ASSESSMENT
Low imminent risk of harm/violence to self/others.

CHRONIC/STATIC RF
-White
-Man
-Unemployed
-Single
-Chronic mental illness 
-Prior hx of psychiatric hospitalization
-Multiple failed psychiatric medication trials

MODIFIABLE RF
- Depression - we mitigated this by treating the patient with 
medication. He tolerated therapies well and was much improved at 
time of d/c with no significant neurovegetative symptoms. 
-Supports - pt had no outpt treaters and we modified this by 
assigning him to the Arbour HRI partial. And offered resources 
to set up outpatient therapist and psychiatrist. 
-Substance Use - pt was advised strongly to avoid etoh/drugs. We 
provided psychoeducation and referrals for him as an outpatient. 

 He understood the risks of use and appears to be in the 
motivated stage of recovery.
-Personality traits- we conducted a personality assessment with 
the pt. Based on the assessment result, he has a significant 
component of borderline personality traits, ego-syntonic traits, 
anxiety, depression, irritability, and inter-personality 
distrust. 

PROTECTIVE FACTORS

- Help seeking behavior - pt was able to acknowledge that he 
needs help and willing to be admitted 
- No prior suicidal attempts-pt had passive suicidal thoughts, 
but no prior intention or attempts to suicide

#PROGNOSIS
Guarded- Pt is prone to relapse into depression given 
nature of his illness and h/o many failed medication trials. His 
borderline personality traits and substance use history are also 
significant contributors to his high suicidality and refractory 
depressive symptoms.
