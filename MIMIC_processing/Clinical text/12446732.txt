History of Present Illness:
The patient is a  ___ yo F with a history of Alzheimer's
disease who presents with new onset seizure x 2. 

By report, 2 weeks ago during a visit to her long term care
facility, her daughter noted onset of an intermittent
vocalizations with full body jolt that was occurring every few
minutes in a ___ hour period and resolved spontaneously. She
thought this may represent a tic or medication side effect,
though it had never been observed previously. She was able to
speak and interact during this time. It self-resolved within a
few hours.  

According to the facility where she lives there were no other
reported vocalizations, but the daughter returned this AM around
9AM again to find her making these vocalizations. She decided to
take her out for a drive as they had improved with ambulation
previously, though she looked unsteady so they returned to the
facility. 

Then at 11AM while sitting in her chair, she had full body
stiffening without clonic movements with perioral cyanosis x ___
minutes. They turned her to the R while sitting in the chair,

slow
to respond. EMS was called and she was taken to ___. 

There at 3PM, she had a second event of full body stiffening x 1
minutes with eyes opening with eyelid flutter, urinary
incontinence and tongue bite. Just prior to this seizure, she 
had
onset of vocalizations again that increased in frequency and she
then went into the full body stiffening. She received 0.5mg
Ativan which stopped the vocalizations after the generalized
seizure and then 1000mg Keppra at 1457. 

Chem normal with Na 140, WBC 9, normal LFTs. She was transferred
to ___ for further management. 

Neurologic review of systems unable to be completed given
patients mental status. 

On general review of systems, the daughter reports she has had 
no

IMAGING
=======
- CT Head (___)
Per report, no acute process. 

- CT Shoulder 
1.  Fractures/anterior dislocation of the humeral head.  There 
is a large ___ deformity as well as anterior 
subluxation/dislocation of the humeral head in relation to the 
glenoid.  Bony Bankart injury is also seen. 
2.  Lipohemarthrosis. 

=================
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
=================
- EEG ___
Final report pending. Preliminary: diffuse background slowing, 
occasional FIRDA. No electrographic seizures or other 
epileptiform activity. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ woman with Alzheimer's disease who 
presented with new-onset seizures and complex right shoulder 
fracture. CT imaging at ___ was negative for any acute 
process, she had no focal findings on exam. She was started on 
Keppra and had no other events. She was monitored on EEG, which 
also showed no epileptiform activity. Her galantamine was held, 
per her primary neurologist Dr. ___, due to 
lowering of seizure threshold. 

# New-onset seizures: As above. Two event types as described by 
daughter, who is a ___: 1) Sudden whole body "jolting" and 
crying out, lasting instants. 2) Generalized seizure with tonic 
stiffening of arms and no clonic movements. 
- Continue Keppra 500mg BID
- Seizure plan: lorazepam ___ PRN seizure >5 min
- Possible MRI in future. Unlikely to change management, but may 
be considered per Dr. ___. 

# Right shoulder fracture: Most likely non-operative per 
orthopedics, as would require shoulder replacement which is a 
large surgery in this elderly patient with advanced Alzheimer's 
disease. However, the surgery will be considered if she is in 
intractable pain. 
- Orthopedics outpatient appointment with Dr. ___ (___)
- Arm sling. 
- Continue acetaminophen 650mg Q6H, since patient does not 
verbalize pain well. 
- Continue lidocaine 5% ointment to right shoulder DAILY. 
- Continue ___. 
- Resume aspirin 81mg for now. No surgical intervention planned. 


# Urinary retention: Currently Foley in place. Difficulty using 
bed pan or diaper. Requires significant assistance to get out of 
bed to commode. 
- Continue working with ___ to improve mobility. 
- When Foley removed, bladder scan regularly due to recent 
history of possible primary urinary retention. 

# Alzheimer's disease
- Continue home memantine 10mg BID. 
- Hold home galantamine 8mg BID due to decreased seizure 
threshold. 

# Hypertension: Previously treated but discontinued medication 
due to light-headedness and near falls. SBP during admission 
ranged from 140-170. 
- Continue to monitor during rehab. 
- Consider very small dose of anti-hypertensives if BP does not 
improve as pain better controlled. 

# Leukocytosis: Likely related to shoulder fracture. Afebrile.  
UA negative. Lungs clear. 
- Monitor CBC intermittently. 
- Remove Foley as soon as possible.
