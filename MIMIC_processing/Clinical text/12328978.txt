Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a mechanical fall. CT scan 
revealed you had an intracranial bleed, a left sided rib 
fracture and a left clavicle fracture. Because you are on a 
blood thinner, a repeat head CT scan was obtained, which did not 
show the bleeding in your head to be getting any worse. You have 
worked with Physical Therapy, and you are medically clear to be 
discharged home to continue your recovery. You should not take 
your Coumadin for 7 days (___). You are also being 
prescribed a new medication, Keppra, to prevent seizures from 
the blood in your head. You should take this for 7 days. You 
will also need one more dose of Vitamin K tomorrow. You will be 
provided with prescriptions for these medications, and pain 
medicine. You will need to follow-up at the appointments listed 
below. Please note the following discharge instructions:

* Your injury caused one rib fracture and a left clavicle 
fracture which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you 
to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

Return to the Emergency Department or see your own doctor right 
away if any problems develop, including the following:
 Persistent nausea or vomiting.
 Increasing confusion, drowsiness or any change in alertness.
 Loss of memory.
 Dizziness or fainting.
 Trouble walking or staggering.
 Worsening of headache or headache feels different.
 Trouble speaking or slurred speech.
 Convulsions or seizures. These are twitching or jerking 
movements of the eyes, arms, legs or body.
 A change in the size of one pupil (black part of your eye) as 
compared to the other eye.
 Weakness or numbness of an arm or leg.
 Stiff neck or fever.
 Blurry vision, double vision or other problems with your 
eyesight.
 Bleeding or clear liquid drainage from your ears or nose.
 Very sleepy (more than expected) or hard to wake up.
 Unusual sounds in the ear.
 Any new or increased symptoms
