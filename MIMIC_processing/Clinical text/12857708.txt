___ Imaging:

Chest CT scan w/o contrast Date: ___ [x] outside film
Impression: Soft tissue swelling adjacent to the sternum
involving the subcutaneous fat and medial pectoralis muscles.
Inflammation also involves the left costochondral structures and
extends to the left side of the anterior and superior
mediastinum. No definite lytic changes or fluid collections are
visualized. CT can be insensitive for early osteomyelitis. MRI
may be helpful.

Chest MRI scan w/o contrast Date: ___ [x] outside film
Impression:
1. Limited study due to lack of IV contrast. Patient was unable
to complete the study due to pain
2. Cellulitis and myositis in the anterior mediastinum.
Questionable small abscess measuring up to approximately 3 cm
anterior to the sternum, but this is difficult to ascertain
without IV contrast
3. Erosion through the left second sternochondral junction
4. mild non-specific marrow edema in the manubrium and body of
sternum, which may be due to either reactive edema or
osteomyelitis.

Chest US Date: ___ [x] outside film
Impression: Slightly ill-defined 4 x 1.2 x 2 cm hypoechoic area
in the midline overlying the sternum with increased vascularity
which may represent phlegmonous type inflammatory or infectious
process. No definite discrete drainable fluid collection is
identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with active IVDA and HCV who presented to 
___ with sternal pain and swelling x 1 month. CT 
chest w/o contrast showed soft tissue swelling adjacent to the 
sternum involving the subcutaneous fat and medial pectoralis 
muscle. MRI chest without contrast showed myositis anterior to 
sternum, with questionable non-specific marrow edema concerning 
for reactive edema or osteomyelitis, limited by lack of 
contrast. He was started on Vanc/Unasyn and transferred to ___ 
for Thoracic surgery evaluation. 

Patient was continued on IV Vanc/Unasyn at ___. He was 
evaluated by Thoracic surgery who did not feel that he required 
immediate surgical evaluation. However, prior to obtaining final 
recommendations from the surgical team, the patient eloped. He 
had been explained the severity of the infection, need for 
parenteral antibiotics regardless of surgical intervention and 
risk of worsening infection, complications including death. 
Patient had stated understanding of this during rounds. 

Upon discovery of elopement, patient was called and reached on 
his cell phone. Risks of leaving AMA were discussed with him 
again and he was encouraged to return for further treatment. He 
refused to return to ___, but reported that he would present 
to ___ for antibiotic treatment. In the case that 
he did not return to medical care, a prescription for oral 
antibiotics were called in to his pharmacy. He expressed 
understanding that this was a suboptimal treatment plan, and 
that it was imperative that he return for parenteral treatment. 
He also reported that he had self-discontinued his PIV prior to 
discharge. His fiancÃ© was also reached to update her on the 
situation and she agreed to encourage him to seek medical 
attention. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
- patient needs further evaluation of sternal infection (ideally 
MRI with contrast) to determine course of parenteral antibiotics
