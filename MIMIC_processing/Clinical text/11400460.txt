or ___, PA-C will address any questions or 
concerns you may have. If this is an urgent matter at night or 
on weekends please call ___ and ask the page operator 
to page the covering ___ call orthopaedic physician. 

Prescription refills or changes cannot be addressed after normal 
business hours or on weekends.

PAIN CONTROL:

-You may or may not have had a nerve block depending on the 
type of surgery. This will likely wear off later in the evening 
and it is normal to have increased pain when the nerve block 
wears off. Please take your prescribed pain medications as 
directed with food prior to the nerve block wearing off. 
-Stay ahead of the pain!
-Narcotic pain medications can cause constipation. Please take 
a stool softener while taking these and drink plenty of water.
-Please plan ahead! If you are running out of your medication 
prior to your follow-up appointment please call during business 
hours with a ___ day notice. Prescription refills or changes 
cannot be addressed after normal business hours or on weekends.

NON-NARCOTIC PAIN CONTROL

-Multi-modal pain control is critical. If you are able to take 
Tylenol (acetaminophen) I would strongly encourage you to do so 
according to the instructions on the bottle. Do not take more 
than 4,000 mg of Tylenol in 24 hours.
-NSAIDs (Advil, Motrin, Aleve, etc) are also excellent for pain 
control post-operatively. Do not take if you have had a bone 
fusion surgery, but for soft tissue procedures or most fracture 
surgeries these medications are acceptable unless you are unable 
to take for other medical reasons or unless we have specifically 
instructed you against it.
-Elevation with the operative site above the level of the heart 
will decrease swelling and improve pain control
-Ice or cold therapy may also be helpful. Do not keep ice or 
cold directly on the skin and do not use for more than ___ 
minutes to decrease risk of skin injury from the cold. Do NOT 
use ice when the block is still in effect as you will not know 
if you are injuring yourself. You may place the ice pack behind 
your knee if you have a bulky dressing on your foot. 
-Every little bit helps. The faster you can come off the 
narcotic medication the better. Most of my patients do not need 
narcotics after the first post-operative visit!

ACTIVITY:

-You will likely have swelling after surgery. Please keep the 
foot elevated on ___ pillows at all times possible. You can 
apply a dry, covered, ice-bag on top of your dressing or behind 
your knee for 20 minutes at a time as often as you like.
-You may let the operated extremity touch the ground but do not 
transmit any weight through it until you come back for your 
first postoperative visit.

CARE FOR YOUR DRESSING:

-You should not remove your dressing. I will do so when I see 
you for your first post-operative visit.
-It is not unusual to have a little bloody staining through 
your dressing. However please call the office for any concerns.
-Keep your dressing clean and dry. You will have to cover it 
when you bath or shower. If it gets wet please call the office 
immediately.

PREVENTION OF BLOOD CLOTS:

-You have been instructed to take medication in order to help 
prevent blood clots after surgery. Please take an aspirin 325 mg 
every day unless you have been specifically prescribed a 
different medication by me. If there is some reason why you 
cannot take aspirin please notify my office.

DRIVING:

-My recommendation is that you should not drive if you:
(1)are still taking narcotic pain medications
(2)have any type of immobilization on your right side
(3)are unable to fully bear weight without pain on your right 
side
(the above also apply to the left side if you have a manual 
transmission (stick shift)

-There is no substitute for common sense and safety. If you do 
not feel safe driving, do not do so.  Practice in an empty 
parking lot prior to driving on the road.  
-Driving is easy. Stopping in an emergency is hard
