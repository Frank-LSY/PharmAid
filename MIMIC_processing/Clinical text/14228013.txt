PCI (___), HTN, HLD, COGNITIVE DECLINE (concern for LBD) and 
depression who presents to the ED with chest pain and suicidal

#CHEST PAIN W/ HISTORY OF CAD + NSTEMI S/P PCI: Patient with CAD 
history including prior NSTEMI and PCI. He has had exertional 
chest pain recently evaluated with a negative stress test on 
___, performed by his primary cardiologist, without ischemic 
changes or reproducible symptoms. This, in combination with his 
lack of EKG changes and Trop negative x3, made ACS unlikely. 
More likely differential to explain his chest pain is MSK vs 
anxiety/panic Sx. Initially, given history, in ED, Cardiology 
recommended exercise exercise MIBI. However, after further 
discussion with Cardiology, and after able to verify neg 
exercise stress and neg trops/no EKG changes, no urgent need for 
exercise-MIBI at this time. Furthermore, due to pt's worsening 
depressive Sx, would be unable to perform exercise-MIBI. 

###After discussion with pt's outpatient Cardiologist (Dr. 
___ in ___, plan to pursue this 
w/u as outpatient & pt medically cleared for inpatient psych 
admission. Pt was continued on home ASA 81 & Atorva 40mg###

#DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY: Patient does not meet ___ 
criteria per Psychiatry consult in ED. However, patient would 
benefit from inpatient admission and both patient and wife are 
in agreement with this as of admission. Pt was continued on home 
Wellburtin 200mg qd, Trazadone 150mg qgs, and Hydroxyzine 25mg 
qhs prn.

CHRONIC ISSUES

warranted and once depression well controlled.
