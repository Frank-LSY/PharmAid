Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD #0, she had low urine output and was given a bolus of 
500cc of LR and responded well. Early in the morning on POD#1 
she reported having facial swelling and flushing. This resolved 
without further intervention. The patient attributed this to a 
reaction to ___ as she stated she had it once in the past 
after a hip injection.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was 
removed and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. 
The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical 
incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or 
abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical 
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and 
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was 
acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral 
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and 
the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions. 

 
Ms. ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
