History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of NIDDM who
presents as transfer from ___ with left chest pain 5 
days
after a fall with CT findings notable for L rib fractures and
small L pneumothorax.  

Patient reports that 5 days prior to presentation, he was 
tilling
the soil ("dethatching") of his son's lawn and walking backward
in doing so when he tripped over one granite block and fell on
another, striking the left side of his body. He denies 
headstrike
and denies LOC and has complete recall of the event.  He had
severe immediate left chest pain and shortness of breath, and
states that he took approximately 5 minutes to catch his breath. 

Following this, however, he was able to get up and states that 
he
actually continued dethatching the lawn for the next 4 hours.  

His pain persisted for the next 5 days and ultimately his wife
convinced him to come into urgent care today, whereupon he was
referred to ___ and underwent imaging with left chest
findings as stated above (also see CT reports below).  He was
then referred to ___ for further evaluation.  

On presentation, he states that he is feeling generally well and
has no shortness of breath. He denies any fevers / chills /
nausea / emesis.  His pain is currently minimal but becomes 
worse
with movement.  He does also feel a twinge of pain with 
extremely
deep inspiration.  He was provided in the ED with an incentive
spirometer and is managing to inhale volumes in excess of 2
liters with minimal difficulty.

Chest CT with contrast
___: ___
IV CONTRAST:  75 cc of Omnipaque 350.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from earlier in the day
FINDINGS:
- HEART: The heart is normal in size. There is coronary
calcification consistent with an element of coronary artery
disease.

identified.

edema is identified. There is partial atelectasis of the basilar
segments of the left lower lobe.
- LUNG NODULES: There is a 5 mm nodule in the left apex. There
are benign calcified granulomas in the right lung.
- PLEURAL SURFACES: There is a moderate left pneumothorax. There
is a small associated left pleural effusion.
- UPPER ABDOMEN: There is an incidental left upper pole renal
cyst. The spleen, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and adrenals are
otherwise unremarkable.
- AXILLAE: No axillary adenopathy is identified.
- MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are degenerative findings in the spine.
There is calcification along the anterior longitudinal ligament.
There is a 8mm area of dense sclerosis in the T4 vertebral body,
likely representing a bone island. There are fractures of the
posterior left sixth through 10th ribs. There is also a fracture
of the 11th rib at its articulation with the spine.
- ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: There is chest wall emphysema associated
with the rib fractures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Fractures of the posterior left sixth through 10th ribs.
2. Moderate left pneumothorax.
3. Left chest wall emphysema.
4. Partial collapse of the basilar segments left lower lobe.
There is a 5 mm left upper lobe nodule.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male status post fall 5 days ago. CT scan notable 
for multiple left-sided rib fractures and moderately sized but 
potentially loculated pneumothorax. Patient evaluated by trauma 
surgery, admitted to their service for further monitoring, no 
chest tube recommended. The patient was hemodynamically stable. 

Pain was well controlled. During this hospitalization, the 
patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with 
respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively 
participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay. He was pulling ___ on the IS and oxygen was 93% on room 
air. On HD2, repeat CXR showed moderate to large left 
hydropneumothorax, unchanged from the prior study.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a fall. Your chest x-ray and CT 
scan showed several fractured ribs on the left side and a 
partial lung collapse, from air collecting around the space of 
the lung (pneumothorax). You were monitored closely and a repeat 
x-ray showed the lung injury was stable and not expanding. Your 
pain is well controlled and you are breathing comfortably. You 
are cleared for discharge home to continue your recovery. You 
should get a repeat chest x-ray at your follow-up appointment 
with your PCP next ___.

*Please restart your metformin tomorrow ___. 

Your injury caused 6 rib fractures which can cause severe pain 
and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of 
the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).
