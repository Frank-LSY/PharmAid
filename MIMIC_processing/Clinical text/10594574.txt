torso.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP): ___
No significant change compared to the most recent prior study.

EXAMINATION:  CT CHEST ABD PELVIS W CON

INDICATION:  Trauma, eval for intrathoracic hemorrhage/injury

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired through the chest,
abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast
administration with split bolus technique.
Oral contrast was not administered.
Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on
PACS.

DOSE:  Acquisition sequence:
1) Spiral Acquisition 9.3 s, 73.1 cm; CTDIvol = 10.5 mGy (Body)
DLP = 767.9 mGy-cm.
Total DLP (Body) = 768 mGy-cm.

COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.

FINDINGS:  CHEST:

HEART AND VASCULATURE: The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber
without evidence of acute injury.  The heart,
pericardium, and great vessels are within normal limits. No
pericardial effusion is seen.

AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: There is a calcified left 
axillary
lymph node.  No axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
lymphadenopathy is present.  No mediastinal mass or hematoma.

PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

LUNGS/AIRWAYS: There is dependent bilateral atelectasis.  Lungs
are clear without masses or areas of parenchymal
opacification.  The airways are patent to the level of the
segmental bronchi bilaterally.

BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no
abnormality.

ABDOMEN:

HEPATOBILIARY: A lobular, hypointense 1.1 cm lesion is 
visualized
in the right lobe of the liver (series 2: Image 100),
and likely represents a biliary cyst or hamartoma.  An 
additional
0.9 cm coarse calcification is seen in the right lobe
of liver, unchanged from multiple prior exams.  Otherwise, the
liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout.
There is no evidence of focal lesion or laceration.  There is no
evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary
dilatation.  The gallbladder is somewhat decompressed but within
normal limits.

PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without
evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal
dilatation.  There is no peripancreatic stranding.

SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout,
without evidence of focal lesion or laceration.

ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size
and shape.

URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal
nephrogram.  There is no evidence of focal renal
lesions or hydronephrosis.  There is no perinephric abnormality.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops
demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and
enhancement throughout.  The colon and rectum are within normal
limits.  The appendix is surgically absent.  There is
no evidence of mesenteric injury.

There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.

PELVIS:

The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.  There
is no free fluid in the pelvis.

REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate is enlarged.  There are
postsurgical changes from vasectomy.

LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
lymphadenopathy.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy.

VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm or
retroperitoneal hematoma.

BONES: There is a nondisplaced fracture through the right
inferior pubic ramus.  There is an additional nondisplaced
fracture through the anterior column of the right acetabulum.  
No
dislocation is identified.  No focal suspicious
osseous abnormality.  Nondisplaced left fourth, fifth, sixth and
seventh rib fractures.  Mild multilevel degenerative
changes of the spine, most pronounced at L4-L5.

SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal
limits.

IMPRESSION:  1.  Nondisplaced left fourth, fifth, sixth and
seventh rib fractures.
2.  Nondisplaced fracture of anterior column of the right
acetabulum.
3.  Nondisplaced fracture of the right inferior pubic ramus.
4.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
5.  No evidence of solid organ injury.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old man who fell from a roof and was found 
to have left ___ rib fractures, non-displaced right acetabular 
fracture, and right inferior pubic rami fracture (nonoperative). 
He was evaluated by orthopedic surgery who recommended crutches 
PRN and nonoperative management with follow up in 2 weeks for 
reimaging. ___ recommended home with ___. 

His pain was originally controlled with PCA and lidocaine
