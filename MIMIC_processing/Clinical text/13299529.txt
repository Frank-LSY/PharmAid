Discharge Instructions:
-Please also refer to the instructions provided to you by the

-AT least ONE to TWO times daily, GENTLY PULL THE BULB "DOWN" 
into the dependent scrotum (unless otherwise explicitly 
advised.)

-ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.

-over the next several days you may experience some increased 
swelling of your phallus (and scrotum) resembling a semi-rigid 
phallus (semi-erect); this is "normal" from the prosthesis and 
related surgery/edema. This may be accompanied by discoloration 
(ecchymosis) involving the phallus and the scrotum; this too is 
normal and will gradually resolve.

-Please remove the surgical dressing over penis and/or under 
scrotum on post-operative day two: no further wound care is 
needed and you may leave the wound open to air. 

-Please keep your phallus at midline, pointed toward your 
umbilicus, taped in place with protective gauze/pads (if 
necessary) for the next ___ days. Of course you may point it 
downward for voiding.

-Use a jock-supporter/strap or jockey-type briefs or tight, 
tighty-whities to facilitate this; Subsequently you may 
transition to loose fitting briefs or boxer-briefs for 
support--they should be cotton and/or breathable.

-Do NOT use prosthesis for 6 weeks and until explicitly advised 
by your urologist

-Complete a 7-day course of antibiotics as directed 

-You may shower, but do NOT bathe, swim or otherwise immerse 
your incision.

-Do NOT lift anything heavier than a phone book and no sports, 
vigorous physical activity (including sexual).

-Tylenol should be your first line pain medication, a narcotic 
pain medication has been prescribed for breakthough pain >4. 
Replace Tylenol with narcotic pain medication. Max daily Tylenol 
dose is 4gm, note that narcotic pain medication also contains 
Tylenol (acetaminophen)

-Do NOT drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do NOT 
operate dangerous machinery. 
For your safety, please do NOT DRIVE FOR ONE WEEK AFTER SURGERY 
or unless otherwise advised. 

-Colace has been prescribed to avoid post-surgical constipation 
and constipation related to narcotic pain medication, 
discontinue if loose stool or diarrhea develops. Colace is a 
stool "softener"- it is NOT a laxative

-Resume your home medications, EXCEPT HOLD NSAIDs (aspirin, and 
ibuprofen containing products such as Advil & Motrin, Excedrin) 
for ONE week or until you see your urologist in follow-up OR you 
are explicitly advised to resume sooner by your PCP, ___
