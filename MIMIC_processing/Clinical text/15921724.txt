History of Present Illness:
Per Dr. ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry 
Consult note:
"Of note, ED nurse states that patient has just received PO 
Ativan 1 mg once (for anxiety) prior to psychiatry arrival. As 
such, patient is sleepy with limited interview as noted below.

When asked why she is in the ED, the patient reports "I just had 
a rush of anxiety. This made me wonder where this was coming 
from. We made some productive steps here, here in the ED talking 
about plans forward. Basically I've never been unreliable but 
this depression and anxiety has been making me less reliable, 
cancelling meetings because the right technology or part is not
there yet." 

She feels that her primary problems are her anxiety and 
indecision. She states she came to the ED tonight because her 
anxiety is worse than usual. She notes that her anxiety started 
a year ago around the time of her divorce. She states that 
"everything that I've been having at home, with anxiety worse at
nighttime, is not working. I'm loading up on tylenol ___, 
magnesium powders, melatonin, my friend gave me a barbituate 
once... but none of it is working." 

She relates her indecision as connected to feeling that she has 
depression. She describes a vignette of being offered various 
classes to take, but that she felt obligated to listen to her 
parent's advice because they support her, and they advised her 
against taking a class. She describes a behavior of then signing 
up for the class, canceling, signing up again, and then 
canceling. She describes this is as new behavior for her. 
Parents are supporting her financially as she is a ___ 
and some of her projects in the ___ fell through. She will 
have to move out of her apartment because of this and will begin 
living with her parents again in ___.

She states having thoughts the other day of how many pills she 
would need to overdose. She describes looking up dosages on the 
internet for tylenol and advil needed for overdose. She states 
that these thoughts are new for her. Denies intent of acting on 
this. No actions of buying any Tylenol or advil. No prior SAs. 
No formal hx of psychiatric diagnoses. 

Denies prior psychiatric hospitalizations, but later describes a 
stay in the hospital in her ___ for "anxiety and finding strange 
things on my thyroid glands." She clarifies this was in medical 
hospital and not a psychiatric hospital. She stated that they 
felt this could explain her anxiety and weight loss but 
providers at the time then did not recommend medications or 
surgery, no
follow up after that; pt is not sure with thyroid levels last 
checked. 

No current outpatient psychiatrist and therapist. Had prior 
providers but changed due to insurance issues, stopped seeing 
them last summer. Pt denies hx of prescribed medication trials. 
Saw those providers only approx 6 times.

However, of particular note, patient describes a long history of 
utilizing her husband's ADHD medication. She states, "I've 
always wondered if I have ADHD. Throughout my marriage, I took 
my husband's ADHD medications to keep up with him and graduate 
school, and to keep up as a support system to my mother and
sister during my ___ marriage. I used his ADHD meds to 
concentrate, and as an antidepressant I guess, and it was 
helpful. I liked how it made me feel afterwards, like an 
adrenaline rush, so instead of getting calm you get a rush of 
concentration and have been effective." She states that she 
started taking this medication on their first dates, when he 
would give them to her. States she ultimately took ADHD 
medication recreationally a couple of times a week for a couple 
of years.

Recently, she states that she has also had poor sleep since 
___, with ___ hours of sleep every night. She cannot 
identify stressors out of the ordinary in ___ or ___ of 
last year but relates this simply to stressors of worrying about 
"seeing people the next day, in the morning"

When asked about AVH states "not really." Endorses "maybe 
hearing voices." She states "it is hard to hear if this is 
voices or just the lists of things in my mind from being a 
perfectionist and overachiever. It's hearing other people tell 
me different things of what is needed, like what form is needed 
when lifting a box, hearing my own voice for judging me for not 
finishing things as
quickly as I said I would. Sometimes it just feels like 
self-critical voices."

She also notes having Panic Attacks starting in ___. 
Describes having "long panic attacks for a few hours in my 
apartment." She states that during the panic attacks has 
experiences stomach pain ("like a black hole of dread"), pulls 
her hair, growls, yells in her apartment in the middle of the 
day. Helpful measures are deep breathing, meditation, as well as 
drinking wine and smoking a cigarette. 

She reports PTSD initiating from ___ has now surfaced more due
to living alone. In ___, she states that her wedding was "a 
very
traumatic day" because "lots of family relationships shifted 
that
day in weird ways," with people taking on new roles with her "as
the baby of the family getting married." She states her mother
and sister relationship shifted that week from being close to
completely ending. Patient is vague about this but reiterates
again vaguely that she was the baby in the family, and that she
was the key in the family dynamics working together; states her
sister otherwise did not like her mother's ___. After 
that
time, there were other family dynamic shifts - prior to pt's
birth to father, mom was previously married to a first husband
who died of alzheimers a year after pt's wedding (pt has 3 much
older step-siblings from that marriage). Patient describes that
in this context she was acting as a therapist role in her mother
having mixed memories of this man. Pt also notes trauma from
taking care of mother who had colorectal cancer, and then 
"living
with mother over at ___ when mother had serious infections 
after
this operation (mother alive and well now). In addition, after
pt's divorce last year, she had returned home to live with her
parents but subsequently lived alone. Now that she lives alone
she feels more resentment and worry. 

Regarding other life events, she states she has a new boyfriend.
Pt is employed in ___ and ___ but states that
consulting work has not been going as well lately. Teaches 
___
Thinking.

Regarding physical symptoms, she is aware from the ED that "I
have a lot of water in my system." She is not sure why this is
the case, denies any drinking patterns out of the ordinary.
States that "I can feel lots of water in my body, like 
diarrhea."
States she feels medically well otherwise. 

When asked how we can be most helpful, she states that "I think 
I
need a real anxiety med. It would be great if this could help me
concentrate on my work as well like the ADHD medication did." 
She
is not clear what dispo is most helpful but states that "I need 
a
treatment plan.""

Patient decided to come to the hospital for anxiety medications.

Patient has been having a hard time with her appetite, was very

decisions for herself. And has been getting more stressed out 
and
unsure about how to handle it. Couldn't engage in conversation
about coping skills with ___. Patient redacted herself out of
obligations that she had with some of the contracts. Yesterday
she wanted to call everybody whom she had professional

___ is aware of."

since arriving to the hospital. She states being amenable to
approaching staff should she start to have SI. She reports that
her symptoms started getting worse in ___ because she 
started
working on ___ which was overwhelming for her. She says that

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo divorced female with no formal PPH and no 
significant PMH who endorsed increasing anxiety over the past 
few weeks and SI with internet search regarding how many Tylenol 
pills would be needed. ED staff also noted AH, pressured speech, 
and possibility of mania. 

On initial assessment endorsed increased depression with low 
self esteem, fatigue,
decreased level of energy, self doubt, increased tearfulness, 
decreased concentration. Sense of worthlessness. She endorsed 
feelings of worthlessness and guilt and felt she was a burden to 
her family and friends. She also reported decrease of appetite. 
She lost 10 lbs in a period of 3 months and noted her current 
weight was 108 lb which made her underweight given her height of 
5'6. She also endorsed looking up the lethal dosing of 
acetaminophen in the internet as she was feeling overwhelmed. 
Her stressors included her job, and finalcial stressors which 
would cause her to move in back with her parents. She was also 
struggeling to keep up with her multiple projects outside of 
work and felt she was going to ultimately fail in all of these. 
Patient was also struggeling with her current relationship as 
she had been thingking of endindg her relationship but her 
partner disagreed which caused some increased stress. She 
endorsed constantly thinking about all of her issues, and she 
would perseverated on her past, current and future problems 
during multiple times in the interviews. Her main complaints 
during this current hospitalization in addition to her 
depression and anxiety was her insomnia. Therefore she was 
started on Remeron 15 mg QHS on ___. Patient took one dose 
but felt severely sedated during the day time, and was concerned 
about side effects of weight gain. During her hospitalization 
patient was noted to be fixated on her weight, she endorsed 
gluten and lactose intolerance and was observed to eat minimal 
amounts at meal times. Concern for an eating disorder was raised 
however it did not appear to be patients primary issue during 
current hospitalization. Considered starting on Welbutrin 
however due to weight loss side effects it was decided not to 
start this medication. Given patients wishes to start a weight 
neutral medication she was started on Zoloft 25 mg on ___ ___s Ativan 0.5 mg twice daily as necessary for sleep and 
anxiety. Given the severity of her anxiety symptoms patient was 
offered Risperdal 0.25 mg QHS, as an adjunct for the treatment 
of her depression and anxiety. Concern for possible underlying 
bipolar disorder was raised given her disorganization, tendency 
to ruminate, and past periods of insomnia where patient endorsed 
feeling tired but at the same time activated. At time of 
discharge patient was not observed to have evidence of manic 
symptoms, her presentation was thought to be due to her 
underlying anxiety disorder with superimposed mayor depressive 
disorder. Psychological testing was recommended for patient 
however given this would potentially extend her hospital stay 
patient opted to not complete testing at this time. At time of 
discharge patient continued to endorse somewhat improved 
anxiety, but continued to endorse some difficulty with making 
decisions therefore Risperdal was increased to 0.5 mg at night 
on ___. Patient was in agreement with plan. Did endorse 
improved sleep with her current medication regimen. Patient was 
no longer endorsing suicidal ideation, was future oriented and 
planed to return to her job, and other responsibility as well as

___ system were she would start individual therapy 
and later be referred to a psychiatrist for medication 
management.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting mirtazapine (such as sedation and weight gain), and 
risks and benefits of possible alternatives (Wellbutrin's 
activating effects, including not taking the medication, with 
this patient. We also discussed the above for hydroxyzine 
(sleepiness), and lorazepam (addictive qualities, respiratory 
depression) Risperdal ( EPS symptoms, day time sedation, 
orthostasis, prolactinemia) . Finally we also discussed the 
above for Sertaline, including the possibility of inducing 
mania, serotonin syndrome, increased suicide ideation, increased 
anxiety initially, common side effects of nausea/vomiting, 
insomnia and decreased sex drive. We discussed the patient's 
right to decide whether to take this medication as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team.  The patient appeared able to understand and 
consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon suicide ideation, 
endorsed researching plan for overdose on Tylenol on the 
internet. Her static factors noted at that time include 
Caucasian race, age, marital status. The modifiable risk factors 
were also addressed at that time including; suicidal ideation 
with plan, disorganized behavior, hopelessness, limited coping 
skills, no established outpatient treatment, insomnia, lack of 
purpose, polarized thinking, recent divorce. These were 
addressed though medication management, engagement in individual 
and group therapy, as well as establishment of outpatient 
follow-up with mental health providers. Finally, the patient is 
being discharged with many protective risk factors, including 
help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, sense of 
responsibility to family,  life satisfaction, lack of suicidal 
ideation, no history of abuse, ability to tolerate rejection, 
and strong social supports. Based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is, fair.
