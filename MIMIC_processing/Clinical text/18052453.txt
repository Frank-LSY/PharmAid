IMAGING:

___ XR - Abdomen
FINDINGS: 
 
There are no abnormally dilated loops of large or small bowel.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.
There are no unexplained soft tissue calcifications.  There is 
an
approximately 3 cm linear radiopaque foreign body oriented in a 
craniocaudal
direction projecting over the medial left mid abdomen.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Approximately 3 cm linear radiopaque foreign body oriented in a 
craniocaudal
direction projects over the medial left mid abdomen and may 
represent a
needle/pin/wire or grill bristle.  This is in a similar location 
to the prior
CT (where it appeared just past the Ligament of Treitz) and 
might be
accessible endoscopically.

PROCEDURES:

___ Single Balloon Enteroscopy:

Findings:
Esophagus:
  Mucosa:Normal mucosa was noted. 

Stomach:
  Mucosa:Normal mucosa was noted. 

Duodenum:Normal duodenum.

Jejunum:
  Mucosa:The single balloon enteroscope and overtube were 
inserted through the mouth and passed in conventional fashion 
into the ___ part of the duodenum. The balloon was then inflated 
anchoring the overtube to the intestinal wall. Following this, 
the enteroscope was advanced ahead. After having visualized 
approximately 50 cm of the small bowel, we identified the 
foreign body. A 2cm long, thin needle was seen lodged within the 
mucosa. The surrounding mucosa was normal. A 10mm snare was used 
to grab the needle. Then, under fluorscopic and endoscopic 
visualization, the overtube was advanced to the tip of the 
enteroscope. The enteroscope with the needle were then pulled 
into the overtube, allowing for a safe withdrawal. 

Ileum:Not examined.

# Foreign body ingestion
# Foreign body in the proximal jejunum
- Imaging from OSH demonstrated metallic foreign-body in 
intestines.
- Abdominal XR on ___ on arrival to ED re-demonstrated 
foreign body
- She underwent successful endoscopic removal of the foreign 
body from the proximal jejunum on ___ (see report in 
"Pertinent Results" section above)
- The patient reported that the abdominal pain was preceded by 
eating at a cook-out, and has been stable/constant since, the 
pain resolved after removal of the foreign body, and the 
appearance of the foreign body was consistent with a grill 
cleaning brush bristle so we have high suspicion that the 
foreign body was indeed the cause of her recent GI symptoms.  On 
the day of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet with no 
abdominal pain and no nausea/vomiting.

# Transaminitis
# Hep C Ab positive: probable chronic Hepatitis C infection
- Hx of IVDU
- Had mild transaminitis noted on admission labs, so Hep A, Hep 
B, Hep C, and HIV testing was sent.
- Hep C Ab was positive, so Hep C viral load was sent to confirm 
diagnosis of chronic hep C infection. This was pending at the 
time of discharge and remains pending at the time of the 
completion of this discharge summary.
- The patient was informed of the positive Hep C Ab test, the 
pending confirmatory test, and is aware of the treatment options 
for Hep C.  She will follow-up with her PCP regarding 
confirmatory testing results as well as potential treatment 
regimen.

# Hepatitis A and B non-immune
- Hep A and Hep B testing was done as above, and the patient 
would benefit from immunization for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B

# Chronic opioid dependence on methadone maintenance therapy
- continued on home methadone (110 mg PO daily), last dose 
letter given on discharge

# Tobacco abuse disorder (cigarettes)
# Nicotine dependence
- advised smoking cessation, provided nicotine patch and 
lozenges while inpatient, offered to continue these on discharge 
but patient declined

infection

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted due to abdominal pain and CT scan showing a 
foreign object in your intestines.  You underwent an endoscopy 
that successfully removed the object and you felt much better.

During your evaluation, you were found to have some elevated 
liver enzymes, which prompted additional testing and found that 
you may have Hepatitis C infection.  As we discussed, the 
confirmatory test is still pending, but if it is positive, then 
we would advise that you discuss with your PCP ___: initiating 
treatment for Hepatitis C, as it is now curable.

We strongly encourage you to also discuss with your primary care 
doctor ways in which they can help you to quit smoking.

You have been provided with a Methadone last-dose letter.
