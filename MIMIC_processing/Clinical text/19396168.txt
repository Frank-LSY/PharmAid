CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast ___ (read per OSH 
radiologist)
As compared to prior examination patient demonstrates that the 
pancreatic mass appears to be of increased size from the most 
recent examination. The CBD is markedly distended with 
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. The gallbladder appears to be 
contracted with some high attenuation material which could 
represent contrast or possibly small stones. Splenomegaly. Cysts 
within segment 7 and 6 of the liver. 
  
ERCP report:
Findings:
Test scout film: The scout film was normal.
Limited EGD: Limited exam of the esophagus, stomach and 
duodenum were normal with the side-viewing duodenoscope.
Ampulla: The ampulla was well visualized and appeared normal.
Cannulation: Biliary duct was deeply cannulated with a 
sphincterotome.  The cannulation was not difficult
Cholangiogram: Contrast was injected into the biliary tree.  A 
1.5 cm long stricture at the distal CBD was noted.  The CBD 
proximal to the stricture was dilated to 15 mm and there was 
dilation of the intrahepatic ducts.
Sphincterotomy: A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully 
performed over an existing guidewire.  There was no evidence of 
post sphincterotomy bleeding.  Hemostasis was ensured at the end 
of the procedure.
Stent placement: A 10 mm, 60 mm straight metal fully covered 
metal biliary stent was placed successfully.

Limitations/complications: None

Impressions: Successful ERCP with identification of a 15 mm 
distal CBD stricture.  Sphincterotomy and stent placement 
performed as described above.

Recommendations:
-Return to hospital ward for monitoring
-N.p.o. overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 
cc/hour
-If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance to clear liquids 
and then as tolerated
-Repeat ERCP is required based on patient's symptoms and 
laboratory investigations
-If any abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal 
bleeding please call advanced endoscopy fellow on call 
___
 
Brief Hospital Course:
 Outpatient ___ w/ locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
(s/p multiple lines of chemo, XRT; started C1 palliative 
gemcitabine on ___, splenic vein thrombosis, admitted with 
malignant biliary obstruction, now s/p ERCP with covered bare 
metal stent on ___.

#Abdominal Pain/Nausea/Vomiting
#Acute Biliary Obstruction
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and jaundice likely related to 
interval increase of pancreatic mass Obstruction is likely cause 
of resulting hepatocellular damage suggested by transaminitis. 
Patient was without fevers to suggest cholangitis. As above, he 
underwent ERCP on ___ with placement of a fully covered 
metal stent. He was given aggressive IV fluids and observed 
overnight after the procedure. His diet was advanced. Tbili was 
falling rapidly after relief of obstruction (9->5.6). He can 
resume Lovenox on ___ am. His stent is permanent, and he 
should not need any sort of follow-up with our ERCP team. He can 
follow with his ___ oncology providers as before.

#Pancreatic Cancer
Followed previously by Dr ___ a local oncologist Dr 
___. However, patient noted that he is not going to follow at 
___ any more since Dr ___ for another institution. 
Accordingly will only f/u with Dr ___ in ___. CT as 
above shows interval progression which is not unsurprising as he 
has only recently received a single dose of new regimen of 
weekly gemcitabine. We will update Dr. ___ in ___ 
when the patient is discharged ___ ___.

#Anemia/Thrombocytopenia
Likely related to recent chemotherapy.

#Splenic Vein Thrombosis
Patient has been on prophylactic dosing of Lovenox instead of 
treatment dose and is unsure why. In reading most recent 
outpatient onc note included in patients records from ___ 
___ it says that thrombocytopenia has been ongoing so may be 
reason. He can resume Lovenox the morning after discharge (48 
hours after his sphincterotomy).

#Gout
Continued allopurinol

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Please recheck LFTs same week to ensure ongoing improvement 
in LFTs
[] Resume lovenox 48 hrs post-discharge ___ am)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___!

Why did you come to the hospital?
- Because you have blockage of your bile duct and abnormal liver 
enzymes

What happened while you were in the hospital?
- You had a procedure called ERCP which helped open up the bile 
duct. The ERCP doctors also placed a stent to keep the duct open 
and draining.
- Your abdominal pain and labs improved after the stent was 
placed. Your diet was resumed and you were able to tolerate food 
without any issues.

What should you do after you leave the hospital?
- Please DO NOT take any lovenox on ___. You can resume it on 
___ at your usual time.
- Continue taking your other medications as before
- Make sure you follow up with your oncologist shortly and have 
your liver tests rechecked before the end of this week (we have 
provided you with a script that you can take to any nearby 
laboratory to have the tests drawn).
- If you experience any worsening abdominal pain, fevers, 
worsening yellowing of the skin and eyes, please call the ERCP 
team and your oncologist right away.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
