to the ___ after cutting her inner thighs rather deeply with a

On initial interview, she described worsening depression and 
anxiety that started after an ex-boyfriend died from overdose 
and has been exacerbated by her hating her job. She noted 
reduced self care, depressed mood, anxious mood, irritability, 
and feelings of worthlessness and guilt about functioning poorly

information to insurance companies), her feelings of having had 
an inadequate father who was emotionally distant, her constant

they are to her). She states that she does not want to die and 
cites her love for her family as a reason. She denied SI/HI/AVH, 
and there was no evidence for paranoia or delusions. She denied

On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary

the next day, and remained on that level of observation 
throughout while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#Bipolar disorder, Type II, with rapid-cycling
On initial interview with her treatment team (day following the 
evening of her admission), the patient was frequently tearful 
when discussing stressors but was able to give coherent history 
matching that described in Dr. ___ note dated ___. 
Briefly, the patient described that, over the past several 
months, she had felt increasing unfulfillment and 
dissatisfaction at work that makes it hard for her to function. 
She was also stressed as her ex-boyfriend committed suicide by 
overdose approximately one year prior, but felt her job is her 
primary stressor. She noted depressed mood, anxious mood, 
irritability, feelings of worthlessness, and occasional periods 
of inability to get out of bed. Since ___, she has also had 
occasional ___ day stretches in which she experiences a "high" 
during which she is hyperfunctional (applying for many jobs to 
move back to ___, looking for housing in ___) and requires 
little sleep. These episodes self-resolve, and she returns to a 
mostly depressed and irritable state. For her mental health 
care, she has been seeing a PCP at ___, ___, was 
has taken Wellbutrin 150 mg for several months and was 
prescribed Lorazepam 0.5 mg pro the week prior to her admission.

In describing the events prior to her admission, she described 
becoming anxious and depressed, crying hysterically, after 
leaving a work event at a ___. She reported she did 
not remember cutting her thighs afterward or exactly why she did 
it. Gradually, she stated she thinks she cut herself "because I 
needed help" but did not want to kill herself. She reports her 
roommates brought her to the ___ after seeing the lacerations. 
She
denies SI or HI presently. At the time of her initial meeting 
with her treatment team, she reports continued anxiety around 
getting her life "sorted out." She describes a strong 
relationship with her sister and several coping activities, 
including exercise, that help her through tough times. In 
particular, she knows she does wants to leave her job, but is 
concerned about financial stability and "losing her 
independence" if she does so. 

Given that the patient had reported having experienced several 
episodes, approximately 3 days in length, characterized at times 
by both depressed mood and increased 
energy/irritability/decreased need for sleep, this raised 
concern on part of the clinical team for mixed 
hypomanic/depressive episodes (given episode quality) and 
rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (given episode frequency).  The 
patient was on bupropion 150mg qD at time of admission, and 
reported having benefitted from this medication in terms of 
management of her depressive symptoms. Given concern for 
rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, our team initiated valproic acid 
and quetiapine therapy on the inpatient unit; the patient 
reported marked improvement in mood regulation and showed 
decreased lability after starting these drugs.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Patient denied problematic substance use, with the exception 
of daily use of marijuana, which she was using as a method of 
coping with her work-related anxiety

4. MEDICAL
#) Lacerations to inner thighs were sutured in the ___ ___ and 
there was no evidence of infection or wound dehiscence during 
her inpatient stay.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patients primary team met with them daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: initiated quetiapine and valproic acid.
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting these medications (valproic acid and quetiapine), and 
risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medication, with this patient.   We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any  questions about medications 
with the treatment team, and the attending physician answered 
the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
recent episode of self-harm with self-injurious behavior 
(cutting of her thighs) occasionally since ___.  Their static 
factors noted at that time include history of self-injurious 
behavior, substance use (daily marijuana use), Caucasian race. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is, optimistic.

MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
Disorganized and unpredictable behavior in setting of dysphoric 
mood, agitation, irritability, dissatisfaction with work 
environment,limited coping skills, no established psychiatric 
outpatient treatment or therapy outside of PCP, ___, 
lack of mood stabilizing medication. 

The modifiable risk factors were also addressed at that time; 
the patient underwent psychotherapeutic intervention with her 
treatment team and group therapy to encourage coping skills. 
Mood stabilizing medications were started; quetiapine and 
valproic acid during her inpatient stay.  Finally, the patient 
is being discharged with many PROTECTIVE FACTORS; supportive 
family (especially sister), stable economic situation (with job 
and pending unemployment benefits, stable housing, lack of past 
suicide attempts, medication adherence, willingness and 
enthusiasm to engage with psychiatric and therapist outpatient 
treaters, no known history of abuse, ability to tolerate 
rejection, help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, 
reality testing ability, good coping skills, positive 
therapeutic relationship with PCP, lack of suicidal ideation, 
college-level education.  Overall, Based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.
