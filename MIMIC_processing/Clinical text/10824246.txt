evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/ color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal 
left
ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is
60-65%. Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 
L/min/m2).
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No
ventricular septal defect is seen. Diastolic parameters are
indeterminate. Normal right ventricular cavity
size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for
gender. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 
There
is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral
valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally
normal. There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular systolic function. No
clinically significant valvular disease. Normal pulmonary
pressure.

Cardiac catheterization ___
 Elevated left heart filling pressure.
 No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
 Mild elevation in L-side filling pressures. Mild LVOT gradient
after IV dobutamine.
Recommendations
 Maximize medical therapy

Treadmill stress test ___
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old NIDDM woman with a h/o HTN, HLD
and 
a +family h/o premature CAD was referred to the lab from the ED 
following negative serial cardiac biomarkers for evaluation of
chest 
discomfort, shortness of breath and palpitations. The patien
exercised for 12.0 minutes of a Gervino protocol, and the test
was stopped for a progressive drop in systolic blood pressure.
The estimated peak MET capacity is 6.2, representing an average
functional capacity for her age. There were no chest, neck, arm,
back discomforts, palpitations or pre-syncopal type symptoms
reported by the patient throughout the study. In the setting of
baseline NSSTTWs in the inferior leads and V3-6, at peak 
exercise
there was an additional 0.5 mm scooping ST segment depression in
the inferior leads. These changes slowly returned to baseline by
10 minutes of recovery. The rhythm was sinus without ectopy.
Appropriate heart rate response to exercise with an initial
appropriate systolic blood pressure response to stages I-II of
exercise, followed by a progressive drop in systolic blood
pressure thereafter(182/70->170/70->160/70->150/70 mmHg). 
IMPRESSION: Non-specific EKG changes in the absence of anginal
type symptoms accompanied by a progressive drop in systolic 
blood
pressure with exercise. Average functional capacity. 

EKG:  
- ECG ___ NSR at 66 with normal intervals, normal axis,
normal RWP, no chamber enlargement, no pathologic q-waves, TW
flattenin in III, no specific ischemic ST-TW changes. 
- Previous ECG earlier on ___ with HR 92 mild STD and scooping
in II and AvF, submillimeter STD in V3-6, slightly more 
prominent
than ___ baseline ECG

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===============
Ms. ___ is a ___ F w/ a hx of HTN, HLD, and T2DM who came to 
the ED after having SOB, lightheadedness, and palpitations. She 
has found to have negative cardiac markers, equivocal 
sub-millimeter ST depressions in V3-V6. She was found to have a 
drop in blood pressure on exercise stress test. Coronary cath 
showed NO coronary artery disease. Her home medications were 
resumed at discharge. 

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#Systolic blood pressure drop with exercise stress test
Patient presented with dizziness and nausea, found to have 
negative biomarkers. EKG with "sub-millimeter ST depressions in 
V3-V6". Exercise stress test was negative for angina, but 
notable for a significant blood pressure drop during exercise. 
Patient was admitted with concern that this could be an 
indication of underlying coronary artery disease. ECHO was 
normal. Patient has multiple cardiac risk factors, including + 
FH, HTN, HLD, and T2DM, therefore decision was made to proceed 
with coronary angiography. She was given a beta blocker and a 
high dose statin prior to cath. There was evidence of mild LVOT 
with dobutamine stress, but otherwise, coronaries were free of 
disease. Given the LVOT w/ dobutamine stress, if pt begins to 
have more chest pain at home, would recommend repeating the 
echo. Her home medication regimen was resumed at discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
#Hypertension
Stable on admission. Held HCTZ/lisinopril initially given 
possibility of cath. Resumed home meds at discharge

#Hyperlipidemia
Takes Simvastatin 40mg at home. Given Atorvastatin 80mg prior to 
cath. Simvastatin resumed at discharge. 

#T2DM
Held home metformin. Given SSI while inpatient. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
#Inducible LVOT
- If patient re-presents in the future with syncope or 
pre-syncope, consider repeating ECHO to evaluate for LVOT as a 
possible cause. 

# CODE: Full code, confirmed
