History of Present Illness:
___ F history of CKD III, HTN, remote history of polymorphic 
VT, who presents with acute renal failure. 

The pt reports that she has had very poor PO intake since about 
7 days prior to admission. Initially, this was related to grief 
after having to put down her dog, however she then developed 
nausea w/ several episodes of non blood non bilious emesis. Pt 
reports that she was only able to tolerate very minimal oral 
intake due to severe symptoms. Also associated with chills, 
diaphoresis, and general malaise. Denied having any dysuria, CP, 
SOB, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation. She also 
complained of back pain which she attributed to chronic 
musculoskeletal issues. The pt was seen by her PCP where labs 
were notable for a leukocytosis and Cr of 2.8 from a baseline of 
1.0-1.3. She was given 1L NS and referred to the ED for further 
management.

Of note, the pt has also noticed new vaginal bleeding for 
several days this week with occasional mild cramping. She is 
post menopausal without any other incidents of vaginal bleeding 
in almost ___ years. She has follow up with gynecologist scheduled 
in late ___. 

With respect to the patient's history of polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia, she was diagnosed in the setting of atypical chest 
pain with a negative chest x-ray and EKG. She underwent a stress 
echo that showed a hyperdynamic LV with no change of ischemia, 
however she did have 4 beats of PVCs in concurrence. Has had no 
issues with chest pain or shortness of breath since.

In the ED the pt was afebrile, sating well on RA w/ SBPs 
120s-150s. Exam was unremarkable.

Labs were notable - WBC 16.8 (83.1% PMNs) - Cr 2.0, no other 
concerning electrolyte abnormalities - Lactate wnl

A U/A was positive for leukocytes, blood, bacteria, negative 
nitrites. CXR w/o acute intrathoracic process.

The pt was given: - 2L LR - 1gm IV CTX - 1gm APAP - 4mg IV 
ondansetron

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient endorsed the above 
history, adding that she was feeling slightly better since 
seeing her PCP earlier today. She was able to tolerate eating a 
few ___ crackers on the floor. She also complained of very

VT, who presented with nausea/vomiting and labs revealing for 
acute renal failure, UTI, and bacteremia.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS
=======================
#Acute complicated UTI/ pyelonephritis
#GNR bacteremia
Patient presented with systemic symptoms including nausea, 
vomiting, and CVA tenderness with a leukocytosis and U/A with 
pyuria and bacteriuria. She was started on IV ceftriaxone. Urine 
culture finalized as > 100K CFU E.coli which was sensitive to 
cipro, and blood cultures grew pansensitive GNRs on preliminary 
read. Given improvement in leukocytosis to 10.6 from 16.8 on 
admission, no fever, and significant clinical improvement, 
patient was discharged on p.o. ciprofloxacin for planned 7-day 
course through ___. Plan to follow-up on final 
sensitivities (for blood culture) to ensure proper treatment and 
to call patient (Cell- ___, Home- ___ or 
patient's brother ___- ___ if blood cultures in 
fact show resistance to ciprofloxacin. Patient was reliable for 
follow-up if necessary. Final blood cultures with E. coli with 
same resistance pattern as E. coli from urine, sensitive to 
ciprofloxacin. Pt was notified of this finding on the day after 
discharge.

#Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease stage II-III
Patient presented with creatinine of 2.0 with most recent 
baseline per chart review in ___ of 1.05. Most likely etiology 
pre-renal insult given the history and observed improvement in 
renal function after fluids. On discharge her creatinine had 
improved to 1.3. Her home lisinopril hydrochlorothiazide was 
held pending follow-up with her PCP to evaluate resolution of 
the ___. She was told to check her blood pressures and, if 
elevated, to restart her lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide.

#Nausea/vomiting 
Suspect that these symptoms related to the pt's concurrent UTI 
as this would provide a unifying diagnosis. No diarrhea to 
suggest viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. Low suspicion for other 
primary GI etiology given nml LFTs, lactate, and benign exam. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS
========================

#HTN 
Held home lisinopril-HCTZ given kidney injury. Cr 1.3 on 
discharge, baseline around 1.0. Her baseline Cr may be a little 
higher than 1.0 but given overall normotensive while here, it 
was recommended that she hold lisinopril-HCTZ until follow-up 
appointment and to restart after resolution of ___. However, if 
her blood pressures are elevated, she can restart this BP 
medication.

#Vaginal bleeding: Pt has scheduled gyn follow up in ___, 
no bleeding this hospitalization. 

CORE MEASURES
============= 
 #CODE: Full, confirmed 
 #CONTACT: ___ ___ or ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. 

Why was I admitted to the hospital?

What happened while I was in the hospital? 
====================================
-You were started on IV antibiotics to treat the infection in 
your blood and the urinary tract.
-You were given IV fluids and anti-nausea medication
- You were transitioned to oral antibiotics on discharge

What should I do after leaving the hospital? 
====================================
- Please continue to take your oral antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, 
from ___.
- We were unable to schedule a PCP appointment for you. However, 
we hope that you will be able to contact your PCP and be seen at 
his office within 1 week.
- We recommend that you hold your blood pressure medication 
until you are seen by your PCP, since your kidney function was 
not quite at baseline. However, if you check your blood pressure 
and find that it is high (SBP > 140), then please restart your 
BP medication.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best! 

Sincerely,

Your ___ Healthcare Team
