History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ PMHx cigarette smoking who presents
with word finding and comprehension difficulty. History is
provided from family, OMR and OSH records.

Pt was in his usual state of health ___. He ate dinner with
his son around 21:00 and was acting like his usual self. On 
___,
around 2:30p, pt was scheduled for a doctor's apt (steroid
injections into lower back) and his daughter was planning on
meeting him at the ___. He never showed up so his daughter
called him. At that time, she said that he was mumbling and she
could not understand what he was saying on the phone. She called
EMS.

He was initially brought to an OSH. At OSH, MRI/A brain revealed
subacute embolic infarcts in L MCA territory with complete
occlusion of the L ICA and abnormal signal on T1 fat suppressed
images consistent with dissection. He was given 300 PR aspirin
and transferred to ___ for further management.

somewhat unreliable and does not consistently say yes or no

Pertinent Results:
___ 08:10PM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01
___ 05:25AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.5 eAG-111

___ Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. However, image quality was degraded and 
reduces confidence to exclude PFO. Normal left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function 
(biplane LVEF = 57 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of cardiac source of 
embolus seen. No clear echocardiographic evidence of a PFO 
visualized.  

___ CTA Head/Neck: 1. Evolving left MCA territory infarct. 

2. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from the level 
of the 
bifurcation with reconstitution in the cavernous segment, 
unchanged from prior MRA. 
3. Occlusion of the distal left M1 segment to left M2 segment of 
the MCA, with distal reconstitution also unchanged. 
4. The left A1 segment is diminutive.  It is uncertain whether 
this is 
secondary to congenital hypoplasia versus thrombus. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the stroke service after a L MCA 
infarct with L M1 cutoff and ICA stenosis from bifurcation to 
clinoid segment. There was no evidence of dissection, and it was 
thought this was most likely atherosclerosis with underlying 
risk factors of smoking and a possible familial hyperlipidemia 
syndrome by PCP ___. 

Echocardiogram was normal, EF 57% with no intracardiac thrombus. 
He was monitored on telemetry with no evidence of atrial 
fibrillation. A1C 5.5. LDL pending at the time of discharge but 
documented as 103 at OSH. 

He was started on aspirin 81mg and atorvastatin 40mg as 
secondary stroke prevention. He was counseled on smoking 
cessation. 

He was evaluated by ___ and speech who felt he was appropriate 
for discharge to rehab.  

##Transitional Issues##
1. Continue aspirin 81mg daily and atorvastatin 40mg daily
2. Lisinopril 10mg home dose was held and should continue to be 
held as BP normotensive during admission.

Discharge Instructions:
[ Discharge Worksheet for Stroke]  
 
Dear Mr. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of speech changes 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Smoking
- High choelsterol
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Take aspirin 81mg daily. Increase atorvastatin to 40 mg daily
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.  

 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
