Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
lightheadedness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis ___

 
History of Present Illness:
___ with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and recent admission for pericarditis at ___, who initially presented to his outpatient
cardiologist's office with light-headedness and dizziness, found
to have large pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade on
echocardiogram, subsequently transferred to ___ for
pericardiocentesis and drain placement. 

Patient was in his usual state of health until about two weeks
ago, when he developed sharp substernal chest pain, radiating to
his neck bilaterally. Initially presented to ___ 
ED,
but was discharged several hours later without a clear etiology
for his symptoms. Pain returned later that day, prompting him to
return to ___, where he was admitted for two days
with a diagnosis of pericarditis. Per patient report, his
echocardiogram at that time showed a mild pericardial effusion.
He was discharged home with a plan to taper ibuprofen over the
next three weeks, in addition to one month of colchicine 0.6mg
BID. Unfortunately he did not tolerate same, developing GI 
upset,
diarrhea, and generalized muscle aches, at which time he self
reduced the dose of colchicine to 0.6mg daily. However there was
no improvement in his symptoms and he discontinued colchicine
about four days ago. Over the same time period, he developed
notable dyspnea with minimal exertion. Denied further episodes 
of
chest pain, palpitations, light-headedness, dizziness, 
orthopnea,
PND, or worsening lower extremity edema. At baseline, he does
have mild lower extremity edema, left greater than right. On
___, he did have one episode of acute shortness of breath 
while
lying in bed, but this resolved within minutes.

Presented to his outpatient cardiologist for follow-up today,
where formal echocardiogram demonstrated evidence of early
tamponade with RA collapse, and mitral and tricuspid velocity
variation with inspiration. Referred to ___ for urgent
percardiocentesis.

Underwent successful pericardiocentesis and drain placement in
the cath lab, with 670ml of serosanguinous fluid removed
(predominantly sanguinous). Opening pressure was 20 mmHg, with a
residual pressure of 9 mmHg.

Upon arrival to the CCU, patient reports no symptoms. Currently
feeling well. Denies weight loss, joint pain, skin rashes,
changes in bowel habit (aside from colchicine related GI upset),
and fevers. No history of malignancy or autoimmune disease. Up 
to
date with age appropriate cancer screening, including
colonoscopy. He does report URI type symptoms over the past
month, but is unable to accurately delineate if this represents
his chronic sinus issues or a new viral URI.

10-point review of systems otherwise negative.

- Pericarditis
- History of traumatic skull fracture
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
No significant family history. Denies history of premature
coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or
autoimmune disease.

RELEVANT REPORTS:

___ TTE
CONCLUSION:
There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional left 
ventricular function. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is normal. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection 
fraction is 70-75%. The
right ventricle has normal free wall motion. There is a small to 
moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, measuring up to 
1.4 in greatest dimension. The effusion is echo dense, c/w 
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no 2D 
or Doppler echocardiographic evidence of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Focused study/limited views. Suboptimal image 
quality. Small to moderate, echodense, circumferential 
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of 
tamponade physiology. Vigorous left ventricular systolic 
function. Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of 
___, there is no obvious change, but the suboptimal image 
quality of the studies precludes definitive comparison.

___ EKG
Sinus tachycardia with premature atrial depolarizations
Incomplete right bundle branch block
Minimal voltage criteria for LVH, may be normal variant
Borderline ECG

___ TTE
The left ventricle has a small cavity. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal to hyperdynamic. The
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 70%. 
The right ventricle was not well seen. There
is a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion. The effusion 
is echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There is normal respiratory variation 
in transmitral or transtricuspid inflow, suggesting
absence of tamponade physiology.

___ CARDIAC CATH
The procedure was not feasible without moderate sedation. Risks, 
benefits and alternatives were discussed and informed consent 
obtained. With rhythm, blood pressure and oxygen saturation 
monitors, constant nursing observation, and direct attending 
supervision, the patient received an appropriate level of 
sedation (see medication list above). The attending was at the 
bedside continuously for 35 min during sedation. The patient was 
subsequently observed with serial examinations until the return 
of presedation mental status.
After sterile prep, the left parasternal area was prepped and 
echocardiography was used to identify the optimal window for 
fluid removal - which was the 5 ICS MCL. A micropuncture was 
used to enter the pericardial space and was exchanged under 
flouroscopy to a pericardial drain. Appoximately 700 cc bloody 
fluid was removed without complications. Echocardiography showed 
resolution of the effusion with a fibrinous exudate residual. 
The pericardial pressure was reduced from 20 mmHg to 9 mmHg 
after pericardiocentesis with a residual effusive-contrictive 
picture. The patient was symptomatically improved after the 
procedure.

Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.

Impression
 Serosanguineous pericardial effusion causing tamponade
 Successful pericardiocentesis
Recommendations
 Maximize medical therapy
 Pericardial drain in the CCU overnight

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
=====================
___ with PMHx of T2DM, HTN, HLD, and recent admission for
pericarditis at ___, who initially presented to his
outpatient cardiologist's office with light-headedness and
dizziness, found to have large pericardial effusion with 
evidence
of tamponade on echocardiogram, subsequently transferred to 
___
now s/p pericardiocentesis, drain placement and removal. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
============
# Cardiac tamponade 
# Pericardial effusion likely ___ pericarditis
Now status post pericardiocentesis and drain placement ___, 
with removal of 670ml of serosanguinous fluid with opening 
pressure 20mmHg, residual pressure 9mmHg, and improvement in his 
symptoms. Unclear etiology at this time; suspect secondary to 
recent pericarditis, however pericardial studies are pending to 
evaluate for alternative etiology, including infection, 
malignancy, and autoimmune conditions. Drain was removed ___ 
after output was <50mL/24hr. Although patient did not tolerate 
colchicine BID as outpatient, patient is willing to try daily 
dosing. He was started on colchicine 0.6mg daily however, he 
again was intolerant of colchicine with symptoms of abdominal 
cramping while inpatient . He will also continue increased dose 
of ibuprofen 600mg q8H with omeprazole 40mg daily for GI 
prophylaxis, and will need a creatinine check in 1 week. On day 
of discharge, a follow-up TTE showed residual small-moderate 
residual circumferential pericardial effusion without cardiac 
tamponade physiology.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# T2DM
His home Januvia, glimepiride were held. He was continued on an 
insulin sliding scale while inpatient and home meds restarted on 
discharge. As a transitional issue, he should be evaluated for 
possible cardiovascular benefit from being on an SGLT-2 
inhibitor.

# HTN
His home losartan-HCTZ was held for the procedure and restarted 
given hypertension while in the hospital.

# HLD
He was continued on simvastatin 10mg daily and was transitioned 
to fenofibrate 48mg daily in place of home 54mg.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[] repeat TTE in ___ weeks to re-evaluate pericardial effusion 
re-accumulation
[] repeat basic metabolic panel to evaluate creatinine in 1 week
[] follow up pericardial fluid studies and cytology
[] consider checking CRP/ESR to guide cessation of NSAIDs for 
pericarditis
[] consider starting an SGLT-2 for his diabetes and 
cardiovascular risk factors
