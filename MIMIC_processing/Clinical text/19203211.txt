PSYCHIATRIC:
# Hx of depression, s/p overdose
On admission interview, patient stated that her overdose on 
melatonin occurred in the setting of alcohol intoxication and 
was impulsive in reaction to an argument she was having with her 
boyfriend over the phone.  Although in the moment she felt like 
she wanted to die, she says she immediately self-induced 
vomiting and called an ambulance for help.  The patient reported 
an improvement in mood since initially presenting in to the ED, 
saying she felt "surprisingly fine" on admission to Deac4.  Said 
she is glad to be alive and regretted her actions.  Denied SI.  
Given reported history of depression and recent neurovegetative 
symptoms in the ___ months leading up to this hospitalization, 
patient was started on sertraline 25 mg QD which was tolerated 
well and uptitrated to 50mg QD.

Though initially lacking insight into the seriousness of her 
attempt and reluctant to tell her mother about the overdose and 
subsequent psychiatric hospitalization, the pt gradually 
demonstrated mild insight into her behaviors.  Over the course 
of hospitalization she revealed that she believed she overdosed 
as a way to get attention from her boyfriend and identified 
similarities with a prior SA by overdose on ___ several years 
ago also in reaction to an argument with a boyfriend.  After 
encouragement by the team, the pt called her mother in ___ 
and told her about her overdose and hospitalization.  During her 
time on the unit, the patient slept and ate well, and reported 
normal energy level, interest and concentration.  She 
consistently denied SI and was noted to be future-oriented 
(making plans for packing, moving to ___ to be with family, 
getting a summer job and returning to school in the 
___).  She was engaged in treatment planning and 
accepted a referral to a Partial Hospital Program in ___ as well 
as new outpatient treaters (psychiatrist and therapist).  She 
was discharged on sertraline with plan to return to ___ to 
live with her mother for the summer.

Diagnostically her presentation was felt to be most consistent 
with unspecified mood disorder (substance-induced mood disorder 
versus major depressive disorder) with concurrent alcohol use 
disorder and possible underlying character pathology (given 
tendencies toward impulsive, self-destructive behaviors over 
years).

# ETOH use disorder
Patient reported drinking ___ bottle of vodka the night prior to 
admission (serum ETOH 192 in the ED).  She denied recent daily 
drinking (though had a period of daily alcohol consumption 
several years ago), history of simple or complicated withdrawal 
or current withdrawal symptoms.  In this setting, patient was 
not placed on CIWA protocol.  Team and patient discussed her 
alcohol use and assessed for interest in cessation however the 
patient appeared to be in the precontemplative stage.  Patient 
was encouraged to attend unit AA and ___ recovery meetings and 
to follow-up in the outpatient setting.

as well as smoking cessation counseling.

patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any questions about medications with the treatment team, and

understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT:

modified by providing an alcohol-free environment, providing 
alcohol cessation counseling and encouraging patient to attend 
unit AA/SMART recovery meetings; active mood disturbance w/

providing occupational and milieu therapy; no connection to
