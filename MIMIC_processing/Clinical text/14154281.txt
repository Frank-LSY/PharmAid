Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ transgender female to male with a 
history of ulcerative colitis, depression, eating disorder in 
remission who presented with fever, headache and facial numbness 
likely secondary to early disseminated Lyme with nervous system 
involvement. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Bells Palsy 
# Lyme/Aseptic Meningitis
Presented with fever, headache, Bells palsy, and headache. He 
was also found to have multiple erythema migrans-like lesions 
over his back. He had recently gone camping on the ___ several 
weeks previously. No known tick bites but he reports that his 
dog was found to have ticks.
He underwent LP which revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis.
Lyme serologies were positive.
There was no evidence of heart block on EKG
He was started on IV ceftriaxone, then transitioned to PO 
doxycycline per ID recommendations.
Given fever, rash, Bells palsy, along with positive Lyme 
serologies, early disseminated Lyme with nervous system 
involvement was felt to be the likely diagnosis. Unclear if he 
had true CSF involvement given only mild lymphocytic pleocytosis 
and normal protein, though Lyme meningitis also covered by 
doxycycline as well (oral doxycycline now felt to be safe for 
treatment of Lyme meningitis).
There was concern for concurrent Anaplasma infection given 
elevated LFTs, though treatment would not change. Parasite smear 
was negative for Babesia.
He was discharged on doxycycline with plans for a 28 day course.

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis, likely secondary to Lyme and/or concurrent 
Anaplasma

# Depression: continued home Prozac and mirtazapine

> 30 minutes spent on discharge coordination and planning

Transitional Issues:
====================
- discharged on doxycycline 100mg BID for 28 day course
- ___ clinic follow up pending at discharge
- Lyme CSF studies, Anaplasma serologies, and Lyme confirmatory 
testing pending at time of discharge
- he should have repeat CBC and LFTs checked at PCP follow up

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came in with fevers and headache along with a new rash. Your 
blood tests were positive for Lyme disease. We believe that the 
Lyme disease is affecting one of your facial nerves and also the 
lining around the brain.

You were initially treated with an IV antibiotic. We are sending 
you home on an antibiotic pill called doxycycline. You will need 
to take this medication twice a day for the next ___ days.

Doxycycline can sometimes make your skin more sensitive to the 
sun, so you should try to stay out of the sun as much as 
possible.

If you have any new or concerning symptoms (confusion, shortness 
of breath, palpitations), please return to the ED immediately.

It was a pleasure taking care of you, and we are happy that 
you're feeling better!
