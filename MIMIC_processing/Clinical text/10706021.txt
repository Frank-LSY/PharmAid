Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had changes in 
your vision and were found to be minimally responsive. The 
imaging of your brain showed that you had a tiny stroke. It is 
unclear what caused your stroke. We did a transesophageal 
echocardiogram to evaluate your heart which showed ***. We are 
also going to send you home on a heart rate monitor to look for 
any abnormal heart beats that could have been the cause of your 
stroke. We found that your cholesterol was high, so we have 
started you on a medication to lower it. We have also started 
you on a blood thinner, aspirin. Both of these medications have 
been shown to decrease the risk of a second stroke. It is also 
possible that some of the drugs you have been using could have 
caused your stroke. Therefore, we advise that you avoid these 
substances to prevent you from having another, possibly bigger 
stroke.

Please follow-up with neurology on ___ at 430pm at 
the ___ floor ___ building.

Thank you for involving us in your care.
