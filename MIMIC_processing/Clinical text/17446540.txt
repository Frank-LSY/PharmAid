IMAGING

CT A/P at ___: No acute intra-abdominal process. 
(Reviewed in OSH records.)

CXR ___: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

RUQ US: 
LIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The 
contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. 
The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is 
no ascites. 
BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CHD 
measures 6 mm. 
GALLBLADDER: There is no evidence of stones or gallbladder wall 
thickening. 
PANCREAS: The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within 
normal limits, 
without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of 
the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas. 
SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 14.1 cm. A small 
accessory spleen is incidentally noted. 
KIDNEYS: Limited views of bilateral kidneys demonstrate a 4.6 cm 
left upper pole renal cyst. There is no hydronephrosis or 
suspicious renal lesion. 
RETROPERITONEUM: The visualized portions of aorta and IVC are 
within normal limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post cholecystectomy without intrahepatic or 
extrahepatic biliary dilatation. 
2. Unchanged mild splenomegaly. 

ERCP ___:
 The scout film was normal.  
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome.  
Given the cholangitis, great care was taken to minimize 
contrast injection  
The CBD was 7mm in diameter.  
No discrete filling defects consistent with stones were 
identified in the CBD and CHD.  
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were normal.

the bifurcation.  
Bile was removed.  The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly.  
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD.  
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically. 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with s/p CCY, multiple ERCPs in the past without other 
significant PMH who is referred from OSH with fever and GNR 
bacteremia and elevated LFTs concerning for cholangitis, though 
no findings on ERCP consistent with this, and LFTs downtrended 
on their own.  

# Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: Unclear source.  Patient had 
no localizing symptoms.  CXR negative.  CT A/P at ___ showed 
no process to explain the bacteremia. UA negative, Stool studies 
sent but stool is formed. No recurrent fevers and no symptoms. 
Given history of recurrent sludge in CBD, this still could be 
source and potentially passed a stone and had transient 
bacteremia.  The LFTs were only abnormal finding on admission in 
cholestatic pattern and these trended down on their own to 
normal.  Blood cultures at ___ from ___, and ___ grew no 
organisms though final cultures are not completed.  Received 
Unasyn for approx. 72 hours.  Given no fevers, no symptoms and 
no growth on repeat cultures, made 
presumptive dx of passed stone/sludge with mild cholangitis now 
resolved, and switched to PO antibiotics with ciprofloxacin to 
complete 7 course.

#Anemia, thrombocytopenia: mild normocytic anemia and 
thrombocytopenia was new finding this admission.  Possibly 
related to transient BM suppression from active infection.  Will 
need recheck as outpatient after full treatment for infection.

-Recheck CBC for mild anemia and thrombocytopenia

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.  You were 
admitted for the finding of bacteria in the blood.  You had 
mildly high liver function tests and bilirubin, and therefore 
there was concern that you had an infection in the biliary 
tract.  Therefore you underwent ERCP to evaluate for this.  They 
did not see any evidence of infection nor blockages.  However, 
you did not have any evidence of infection elsewhere, with a 
negative chest Xray and CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Your 
liver enzymes and bilirubin came down on their own to completely 
normal.  Therefore, we think that you may have had a transient 
infection in the biliary tree from a stone or sludge that passed 
and resolved on its own.  You were on an IV antibiotic for 3 
days and never had fevers or further symptoms and your cultures 
showed no further bacteria, so we are transitioning you to oral 
antibiotics to complete a full course of 7 days on discharge.

If you have any symptoms at all once you leave the hospital 
please call your doctor or go to the ER and be vigilant about 
any signs of fever.  Please follow up with your PCP as scheduled 
on ___.
 
Followup Instructions:
