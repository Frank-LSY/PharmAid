PACU for recovery.

She was transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically 
stable. Her vital signs were routinely monitored and she 
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was initially 
given IV fluids postoperatively, which were discontinued when 
she was tolerating PO's. Her diet was advanced the evening of 
POD#0 to regular, which she tolerated without abdominal pain, 
nausea, or vomiting. She was voiding adequate amounts of urine 
without difficulty. She was encouraged to mobilize out of bed 
and ambulate as tolerated, which she was able to do 
independently. Her pain level was routinely assessed and well 
controlled at discharge with an oral regimen as needed. She 
required no narcotics for pain control. Wounds were monitored 
closely without evidence of hematoma or seroma; JP drain was 
noted to have minimal sanguinous output and will remain in place
