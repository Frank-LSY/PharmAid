History of Present Illness:
___ woman without significant past medical history
presents with chest pain. 
The patient states that yesterday she felt a tightness in her
chest during ___ class but thought it was secondary to new
compression shirt.  After the class she felt fine.  This morning
she went to ___ again and about 10 minutes into the right home
again felt a funny tightness in her chest like she needed to 
take
her sports bra off.  Shortly after her return home she was
standing in the kitchen and felt nauseous.  After vomiting she
felt a little better and went to lie down on the couch. However,
she continued to feel nauseous and vomited 4 more times between
10:30 AM and 1:30 ___.  A friend came over and noticed that she
looked ill, this prompted her to call her PCP.  The nurse who
returned her call recommended she come into the office where she
had an EKG done due to complaints of nausea, sweating, and chest
tightness.  The PCP noticed changes in her EKG and sent her to
___ ED. 

In the ED initial vitals were:  98.1, 92, 129/70, 16, 99% RA
Labs/studies in the ED notable for:  trop 0.05, lactate 2.5,
grossly hemolyzed labs. 
Patient was given:  
___ 16:17 IV Ondansetron 4 mg  
___ 16:27 IV LORazepam 1 mg  
___ 16:27 PO/NG TiCAGRELOR 180 mg 
___ 16:45 IV Heparin 3000 Units and drip

Cardiology was consulted and noted an inferior STEMI on EKG. she
was taken immediately to the Cath Lab where she was found to 
have
100% RCA occlusion.  When the lesion was crossed with a wire the
patient became bradycardic and required atropine 1.5mg after
which she was mildly tachycardic.  She underwent successful DES
Ã—1 to her RCA was given aspirin and Brilinta loaded. 
 
On evaluation she is currently nauseated and vomiting with dry
mouth and fatigue but no chest tightness no SOB. She notes that
the last time she took her dextroamphetamine was over a week ago
and that her PCP calculated her cardiovascular risk score a
couple days ago to be 3% and decided not to start a statin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient Summary for Admission:
=================================
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman without significant PMHx 
who presented with chest pain found to have inferoposterior 
NSTEMI, now s/p DES to RCA (100% occlusion). She was monitored 
following the procedure and troponins were trended. Once her 
troponins were consistently down-trending she was felt safe for 
discharge home.

# NSTEMI (Infero-posterior): 
Presented to urgent care with vague chest tightness, emesis, 
nausea and found to have mild inferior ST elevations (<1mm in 
II, III aVF), and mild ST depressions in V2-V4. Sent to the ED 
then to cath, where she had minimal left-sided disease (right 
dominant, normal left main, 30% LAD) but the RCA did have a 100% 
thrombotic occlusion in the midsegment with weak left to right 
collaterals. She had a successful 3.5 x 15 mm Onyx drug-eluting 
stent postdilated to 3.5 mm. During this intervention, she 
became significantly nauseous with associated sinus bradycardia 
and hypotension and did require atropine and recovered well. 
Started on aspirin and ticagrelor in addition to atorvastatin 
80mg daily. Initially had some nausea but this improved. She was 
started on metoprolol at 6.25 BID on ___ that was continued on 
discharge. EKG evolving on ___ with inferior Q waves in 3 and 
aVF with T-wave inversions. ST elevation and ST depressions had 
resolved prior to discharge. Troponins were trended post 
procedurally which down trended from 2.17 to 1.55 prior to 
discharge. MB also down trending prior to discharge (130 to 18 
prior to discharge). TTE performed that showed normal left 
ventricular wall thickness and cavity size with mild regional 
systolic dysfunction (EF 45-50%) c/w CAD in an RCA distribution, 
moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, mild aortic 
regurgitation. Prior to discharge, patient's Ticagrelor was 
transitioned to Plavix due to insurance cost. She was loaded 
with 600mg Plavix on the day of discharge with plan to pick up 
Plavix at pharmacy on ___ while she awaits prior 
authorization for ticagrelor. Patient will follow up with Dr. 
___ discharge, and cardiac rehab as well as stress 
testing will be pursued as an outpatient.

# Pleural Effusion: Small right sided pleural effusion reported 
on echo. CXR demonstrated minimal if any evidence of right sided 
pleural effusion ___. Patient was asymptomatic and stable on 
room air. This finding should be further evaluated as an 
outpatient as needed.

further evaluation should be pursued as appropriate as 
outpatient.
[] Given metoprolol initiation, heart rate and blood pressure 
should be monitored and dose adjusted as appropriate as an 
outpatient.
[] Dextroamphetamine was stopped during this admission.
[] Patient to continue DAPT for 12 months, aspirin indefinitely.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
-You were admitted because you had a heart attack.  

What happened while I was in the hospital?  
-You had a cardiac catheterization that showed a blockage in one 
of your arteries. A stent was placed to open this artery. You 
were started on new medications including aspirin, plavix, 
metoprolol, and atorvastatin to help treat your heart disease.

What should I do after leaving the hospital?  
-Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary and 
follow up at the listed appointments. 
-It is very important to take your aspirin and plavix every day. 
 
-These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the 
heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart 
attack.  
-If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing 
a blood clot forming in your heart stents. 
-Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to 
your cardiologist. 
-You were also given Nitroglycerin, which can be placed under 
your tongue for chest pain. If you are using this medication 
frequently, please call your doctor immediately.
