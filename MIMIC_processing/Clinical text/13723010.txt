The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.

caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel. There is moderate
tortuosity beginning in the proximal segment.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is
moderate tortuosity beginning in the proximal segment. There is 
a 30% stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.

Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.
Findings
 Elevated left heart filling pressure.
 Mild coronary coronary artery disease.

Recommendations
 Maximize medical therapy
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a past medical history 
significant for HT, HLD, pre-DM, and ?Minimal change disease 
(nephrotic syndrome) who presented to the ___ emergency 
department for chest pain, found to have an EKG concerning for 
ST elevation MI. Received aspirin, heparin bolus and Brilinta 
and was transferred to ___. Here, he underwent cardiac 
cath which showed clear coronaries. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
# Chest Pain - Likely GI in origin (GERD)
# Lateral ST Elevations- R/o MI, could be Prinzmetal angina
# Mild Coronary Artery Disease (Based on Cardiac Cath on ___ 

Patient presented to ___ w/chest pain, found to have ST 
elevations in lateral leads and subsequently underwent cardiac 
cath here at ___ showing clear coronaries (mild CAD). 
After this catheterization, patient had recurrence of chest pain 
with stable EKG and flat cardiac enzymes. His symptoms improved 
with Maalox and is likely GI in origin. He is started on a week 
of Zantac to see if his symptoms resolve, and he can take Maalox 
on top of this for pain. After the week of Zantac, if his 
symptoms recur, consider re-initiation of H2 blocker or consider 
more longterm PPI therapy. We also encouraged weight loss to 
reduce risk of reflux. For cardioprotective benefit, patient 
should take a baby aspirin 81mg daily as well as a 
high-intensity statin, atorvastatin 40mg, in lieu of his 
simvastatin. Recommend that his PCP refer him to cardiology for 
outpatient follow-up. 

# Elevated Left Heart Filling Pressures 
On patient's cardiac cath there he was noted to have elevated 
left heart filling pressures. Patient is on room air, breathing 
comfortably, has clear lungs, and no signs of volume overload. 
No inpatient TTE was indicated given low concern for heart 
failure; he could get an outpatient TTE.
Discharge weight: 284 lbs.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# HTN: Continued home losartan

# HLD: Stopped patient's home simvastatin and started 
Atorvastatin 40mg PO QHS as noted above. Discharge 
hyperlipidemia: ___ 77, HDL 49, LDL 80.

# Minimal change disease (nephrotic syndrome): Currently with 
normal renal function. Of note, did receive contrast during 
cath, so will monitor renal function closely. Discharge Cr: 1.3. 


# Prediabetes (A1C 6.2 on ___ at ___: He was maintained 
on insulin sliding scale while in-house. A repeat A1c was 
performed which was 6.2.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
New Medications: Aspirin, atorvastatin, ranitidine, Maalox
Stopped medications: Simvastatin

[] Recommend trial of ranitidine 150mg BID x 1 week. Stop after 
ranitidine and see if the reflux symptoms recur. If the reflux 
symptoms recur, consider re-initiation of ranitidine or consider 
PPI.
[] Encourage weight loss to reduce reflux
[] Recommend that PCP provide referral to outpatient cardiology 
for follow-up given high risk factors for heart disease. 
Consider a TTE as outpatient for baseline cardiac function.
[] Regarding his prediabetes, recommend outpatient follow-up and 
education with PCP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Thank you for coming to ___!

Why were you admitted?
- You were admitted with chest pain. You initially went to ___ 
___, and they were concerned about some EKG changes.
- To rule out a heart attack, you were transferred to our 
hospital for a cardiac catheterization.

What happened while you were in the hospital?
- You had a cardiac catheterization which showed minimal 
coronary artery disease
- You did not need any stents placed, because your coronary 
arteries were mostly "clean"
- You were started on a high dose statin and a baby aspirin to 
take daily
- Your chest pain recurred, but we believe that this is not 
related to your heart and that this is related to your GI tract 
(heart burn or acid reflux).

What should you do when you leave the hospital?
- We will start you on an antacid, Zantac, which you should take 
for 7 days. If the pain recurs after you stop Zantac, you may 
need another acid suppressant (called a proton pump inhibitor). 
Talk to your PCP about this.
- You can take Maalox as needed on top of the Zantac if your 
symptoms are not well controlled.
- If your pain worsens or changes in character (it radiates to 
your arms, it causes shortness of breath, you start becoming 
nauseous or sweaty), it is important to go back to the ED.
- You should follow up with your PCP and discuss ___ referral to 
cardiology. Of note, you may just have an abnormal EKG at 
baseline.
- Your discharge weight on our scale is 284 lbs. We recommend 
that you weigh yourself at home and keep track of your weight. 
If it goes up more than ___ lbs in ___ days (or if you notice a 
lot of swelling in your legs), please let your doctor know about 
it.
- Note that being overweight can also worsen acid reflux, so it 
is important to work on weight loss to help with your treatment 
of heartburn.

It was a pleasure taking care of you! We wish you all the best.
- Your ___ Team
