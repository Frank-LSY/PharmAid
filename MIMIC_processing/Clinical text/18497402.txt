IMAGING STUDIES
==================
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL WO CON
1. No fracture.
2. Tissue swelling hematoma the left periorbital region with a
laceration extending nearly to the left orbital rim periosteum.
3. Much better evaluated on the outside facility head CT is
extra-axial hemorrhage, which is predominantly subarachnoid on
this study seen layering in right frontal sulci. There is also
increased hyperdense blood products in the quadrigeminal plate
cistern. Ventricles are incompletely assessed but appear similar
in size. A dedicated head CT would be better at evaluating the
extent of intracranial hemorrhage and any interval change.

CT HEAD WO CON
New subarachnoid blood products are seen in the quadrigeminal
plate cistern. Other predominantly subarachnoid blood products
layering in the right frontal and parietal sulci are similar.
There may be also a component of subdural blood products
overlying the right frontal lobe. No significant midline shift.
Ventricular size is stable.

CT PELVIS WO CON
1. 4 x 7 x 3 cm subcutaneous hematoma overlying the left hip.
Cannot assess for the presence of active extravasation given the
lack of IV contrast. Adjacent extensive subcutaneous edema
overlying the left hip. Some of this may be extension of
hematoma.
2. No acute fracture dislocation seen.
3. Hypodensity in the soft tissue anterolateral and superior to
the bilateral hips may relate to joint effusions and/or calcific
bursitis.
4. Trabeculated urinary bladder with multiple bladder 
diverticula
seen. 

CT TORSO W/ CONTRAST
1. Re-demonstrated 6.4 x 3.5 cm subcutaneous hematoma overlying
the left hip, unchanged in size compared to CT of the pelvis 
from
___. 
2. No other hematoma, acute fractures, or evidence of traumatic
injury in the chest, abdomen or pelvis. 
3. Right middle lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 8 mm.  See below
for recommendations. 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  For incidentally detected single solid
pulmonary nodule measuring 6 to 8 mm, a CT follow-up in 6 to 12
months is recommended in a low-risk patient, optionally followed
by a CT in ___ months. In a high-risk patient, a CT follow-up
in 6 to 12 months, and a CT in ___ months is recommended. 

SHOULD XR
No dislocation nor subluxation.

R HAND XRAY
No definite fracture is seen.  There are severe degenerative
changes at the first metacarpophalangeal joint, with loss of
joint space and volar subluxation, although no definite fracture
line is seen.  A well corticated osseous fragment along the 
volar
surface of the first metacarpal head is chronic in appearance. 

LEFT HIP XR
No acute fracture or dislocation seen.  Left greater than right
bilateral hip degenerative changes, as above. 

MICROBIOLOGY
==============
Urine culture with mixed flora
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with HTN, HLD, anxiety/depression, and CKD III 
presented from nursing home with subarachnoid hemorrhage after a 
mechanical fall.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
[ ] Incidental pulmonary nodule - 8mm pulmonary nodule noted on 
imaging. Per radiology recs, a CT follow-up in 6 to 12 months is 
recommended in a low-risk patient, optionally followed by a CT 
in ___ months. In a high-risk patient, a CT follow-up in 6 to 
12 months, and a CT in ___ months is recommended.
[ ] Slightly long QT - noted on admission ECG. Trazodone was 
held as it can prolong QTc, can consider restarting in the 
outpatient setting vs. using melatonin/ramelteon for insomnia.
[ ] Keppra - patient to continue taking levetiracetam 500mg BID 
for 7 days (to complete course on ___ per neurosurgery 
recommendations.

ACUTE ISSUES
=============
# Mechanical fall
Patient presented after sustaining a fall at his nursing home. 
Per his report, he was bending over to pick up his wife's shoes 
when he slipped over bags that were on the floor. He denied any 
precedent lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, chest pain, and 
shortness of breath. He does not remember much after the fall, 
likely consistent with LOC that was attributed to his 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Overall, his presentation was most 
consistent with a mechanical fall, however he was monitored on 
telemetry while inpatient without any arrhythmias (only very 
brief sinus pauses (<1.5 seconds) while sleeping, felt to be 
non-pathologic).

# Subarachnoid hemorrhage
Evaluated by neurosurgery in the ED, who recommended 
nonoperative management. He received q4hr neurologic checks that 
were consistently without focal deficit. Per neurosurgery 
recommendations, all anticoagulants should be held for 7 days. 
He should also follow up in concussion clinic as indicated in 
this packet.

# Left thigh hematoma
Noted on imaging in the ED and was felt to be the most likely 
cause of his hemoglobin downtrend while hospitalized. His 
hemoglobin stabilized on ___ at ~12.5.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# HTN
Not on any antihypertensives at home. Normotensive while 
hospitalized.

# CKD III
Reported on nursing home paperwork, though Cr 0.8 with estimated 
GFR > 75.

# Insomnia
Held home trazodone in the setting of slightly long QTc. Can be 
restarted on an outpatient basis if QTc normalizes.
