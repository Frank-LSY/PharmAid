IMAGING & STUDIES
==================
 Head CT ___
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.  Please note, MRI is 
substantially more sensitive for causes of seizure foci, if 
there are no contraindications. 
 
 ECG ___  11:00:35 ___ 
Sinus rhythm. Right axis deviation. Non-specific 
intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific slight inferior 
ST segment elevation and biphasic T wave in lead V2. Clinical 
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for 
comparison.  
TRACING #1 

 ECG ___  5:02:49 AM 
Sinus arrhythmia with a premature atrial beat. Right axis 
deviation. 
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific 
slight inferior ST segment elevation. Right precordial ST-T wave 
abnormalities are non-specific but cannot exclude myocardial 
ischemia. Poor R wave progression. Compared to tracing #1 ST-T 
wave abnormalities are more pronounced. 
TRACING #2 
 
 ECG ___  5:19:44 AM 
Sinus tachycardia @ 110. Right axis deviation. Non-specific 
intraventricular conduction delay. Baseline artifact. Poor R 
wave progression. Non-specific slight ST segment elevation in 
leads V1-V3. Compared to tracing #2 the right precordial T wave 
abnormalities have resolved and sinus tachycardia is new. 
TRACING #___ with significant EtOH use, h/o idiopathic seizures in teens, 
admitted for several witnessed brief tonic-clonic seizures ~24 
hours after last drink consistent EtOH withdrawal. Seizures 
self-resolved. CT head was negative. Patient was treated with IV 
lorazepam x2 with no further seizures, and withdrawal symptoms 
resolved within 24hr.
 
# Alcohol Withdrawal: Reports 750ml vodka use nearly every other 
day and early morning tremors and feeling unwell which improve 
after alcohol intake. He was treated with Diazepam for 
withdrawal (after Ativan given in ED for seizure). 24 hours 
prior to discharge he had no recurrent withdrawal symptoms or 
recurrent seizures. Counseled on abstinence
 
# Seizure: Most likely alcohol withdrawal related. After 
suffering 1 seizure prior to arrival and two additional seizures 
in the ED which resolved with IV Ativan, he had no further 
episodes in house. Neurology was consulted who agreed most 
likely alcohol withdrawal related and no further imaging was 
recommended. He was counseled to not drive for at least 6 months 
or until discussing with outpatient providers.

Transitional Issues:
# EtOH: Patient acknowledges heavy daily use. Please counsel and 
connect with local treatment options. 
# Zolpidem: Patient takes ___ times/week in combination with 
alcohol. Please discuss other options.
# Seizures: Current seizures were likely due to EtOH. Patient 
has h/o several idiopathic seizures at age ___. Records of 
prior workup were not available this hospitalization. Please 
consider further workup as warranted.
# Elevated AST/ALT: 411/284 on admission with GGT 553 confirming 
hepatic source, down to 253/223 at discharge. Likely alcoholic 
steatosis. No s/sx of overt hepatitis. HBV immune, HCV negative. 
Consider RUQ ultrasound.
# Elevated CK, trapezius pain: likely muscle strain ___ 
seizures. CK down-trending, renal function and electrolytes wnl. 
Please consider repeat BMP at next PCP ___.
# ECG abnormalities: RAD, non-specific intraventricular delay, 
poor R wave progression. No clinical signs of any acute cardiac 
or pulmonary
pathology. Consider repeat ECG, and further workup if 
abnormalities still present.
# Code: Full
