Discharge Instructions:
Dear Dr. ___, 

___ was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. 

Why you were here: 
- You had rigors and a fever, and we found you have a urinary 
tract infection with positive urine culture (E. Coli, 
pansensitive). 

What we did while you were here: 
- You received Ceftriaxone in house, and we switched you to 
ciprofloxacin on discharge. 
- We repeated a prostate exam which did not show any tenderness. 


What to do when you go home: 
- We think you most likely have a urinary tract infection 
without prostatitis; however, if you finish your antibiotic 
course and have persistent symptoms you should be seen by a 
urologist for further evaluation. 
- We have made appointments for you with your primary care and 
with your urologist, as below. 
- You may resume your medications as you were taking them 
previously. 
- The last day of your ciprofloxacin course is ___. 

We wish you the best! 

Sincerely, 
Your care team
