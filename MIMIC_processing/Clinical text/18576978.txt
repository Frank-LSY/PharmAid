___ without significant PMH presenting with diarrhea and 
hematochezia after treatment for Chlamydia infection, with 
intermittent abdominal pain, x1 week.  Symptoms improved with 
supportive treatment

# Presumed gastroenteritis with abd pain, diarrhea, 
hematochezia:
symptoms most consistent with simple infectious process improved 
with supportive treatment.  CT scan without acute colitis or 
proctitis.  WBC nl.  Stool frequency decreased.  Blood likely 
irritation from hemorrhoids now resolved.  We will follow up 
pending tests and encourage supportive treatment.  I recommended 
follow up with ___ clinic in 1 week to make sure symptoms are 
better.  If they continue would refer to GI to consider further 
work up for non infectious GI process.

Mild ___ with presumed nl baseline.  Improved with IVF 
overnight. I suspect his ___ is due to prerenal state, 
significant recent NSAID use, and post contrast.  He also uses 
protein powder and has increased muscle mass.
