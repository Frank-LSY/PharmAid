Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and signed a three-day notice on 
___ which expired on ___. She was placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. There were 
no acute behavioral concerns, and no need for chemical/physical 
restraints.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Ms. ___ presented to the ED on ___ after an 
impulsive suicide attempt via ingestion of Ibuprofen, Benadryl, 
and Adderall following a family dispute, and was admitted to the 
inpatient psychiatry unit on ___. The patient reported 
longstanding emotional lability, impulsivity, and aggression, 
with a history of violent behavior.  She stated that she has 
difficulty controlling her anger. She also said that since the 
age of ___, after multiple difficult stressors, she has had 
trouble sleeping, both with initiating and maintaining sleep, as 
well as getting up out of bed in the morning. Since this time 
she has also had intermittent SI when she would become angry. In 
addition, she reported a decreased appetite stating that one 
meal a day was often sufficient for her. 

The patient was initially was not in agreement with 
hospitalization, and was in the emergency room for 4 days 
awaiting bed placement. However upon arriving on the unit she 
was friendly and cooperative with the treatment team and was 
open to trying a medication. She was started on Depakote 500 mg 
BID on ___ for mood lability and anger, and has remained 
medication compliant throughout her stay. The patient reported 
improvement in her sleep (normally 5 hours), getting up to 8 
hours, after initiating Depakote. She denied any other side 
effects except for slightly decreased energy. She also noticed 
that she is not as preoccupied with worrying about the future, 
like finding a new job or thinking of how she will pay for books 
for school. After the initiation of treatment, the patient 
reported that she is able to respond more reasonably when 
angered and not react as strongly. For example, during an 
argument over the phone with her mother she said that although 
irritated, instead of yelling at her mother as she normally 
does, she was able to hang up the phone. In another instance, 
when an unstable patient threw food that landed on the patient, 
she said that instead of reacting impulsively and throwing food 
back, she could reason that the patient was unwell and was able 
to calm down more quickly. She denied that this or any other 
upsetting incidents have led to suicidal ideation. 

Diagnosis appears most consistent with bipolar disorder given 
history notable for decreased sleep, decreased appetite, 
impulsivity, lability, and irritability. However, her most 
prominent symptoms are of aggression, with history of violent 
behavior, and thus would also consider ddx of intermittent 
explosive disorder, ODD,
or another Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder. 

Ms. ___ has expressed that she is looking forward to 
discharge and was proactive in scheduling appointments with both 
her PCP and therapist. She is future oriented and excited about 
a trip to ___ with her mentor and afterwards starting an 
outpatient day program. She has reported that she understands 
the importance of continuing to take her medication and follow 
up with her outpatient providers. She also voiced understanding 
that if she were to feel unsafe or develop SI, to reach out to 
her outpatient providers and/or to return to the emergency room. 
She was in agreement with attending a partial hospitalization 
program, however she is unable to at this time due to lack of 
insurance. This would likely be of benefit to patient in the 
future.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Cannabis-Use Disorder: 
Patient was counseled on substance use cessation in the context 
of a likely mood disorder. She also was encouraged to attend 
addiction recovery groups on the unit.

times having no BM x weeks. She was placed on an increased bowel

factors noted at that time include history of suicide attempt

with Depakote ___ 500 mg BID, group and individual therapy with 
coping skills
lack of engagement with outpatient treatment  addressed by 
appointment with therapist and PCP
limited social supports  mitigated by engaging mother and 
mentor in aftercare of patient and establishing outpatient 
providers
limited coping skills  modified this by encouraging patient 
participation in various groups
insomnia  mitigated by treating patient with Depakote ___ 500 
mg BID and patient reported sleep improvement

risk factors. 
help-seeking nature
