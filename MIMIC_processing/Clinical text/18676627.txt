History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ with hypothyroidism here with persistent 
for 2 weeks found to have large L SDH. 

Of note, pt has a history of migraine headaches in her teenage 
years characterized by throbbing, photophobia, phonophobia for 
which she took as needed strong painkillersdoes not remember 
the name.  After this, she had rare tension headaches for which 
she took Tylenol.

Several months ago in the context of having a particularly  bad 
flare of laryngopharyngeal reflux, esophageal spasm she began 
having several tension type headaches per week for which she was 
taking Tylenol several times per week.  This flare of her 
laryngopharyngeal reflux led to weight loss of 18 pounds due to 
inability to eat regularly.  She is able to eat simple pasta but 
not rice.  She is able to consume honey, yogurt, milk.  She 
cannot drink regular water but can only keep this down if there 
is honey in it.  She has undergone a GI workup including a 
scope.

2 weeks ago, over a period of 1 day, she had gradual onset of a 
more severe headache involving the occipital part of her head 
extending into her neck.  This headache was worse when standing 
or sitting comparing to lying down.  There was no traumatic 
insult including no car accident, no fall, no tripping, no 
vigorous massage (though she has been rubbing her neck more 
after her reflux exacerbation), no heavy lifting.  She has been 
coughing somewhat and sneezing ever since the headache began but 
this has not been particularly severe.  The headache worsens 
when she coughs, sneezes, or bends over.  No blurry vision, 
diplopia, transient visual obscuration.  She has had nausea for 
around 1 day but no vomiting.

She presented to her primary care provider who sent her to 
urgent care for noncontrast head CT due to concern for brain 
mass versus bleed.  Her noncontrast head CT and ___ 
showed large left subdural hematoma as well as right hygroma.  
She was transferred to ___ for further evaluation and workup.

On neurologic review of systems, she has had hearing difficulty 
ever since a left eardrum perforation as well as tinnitus in the 
left ear.  No pulsatile tinnitus.  The patient denies 
lightheadedness, or confusion. Denies difficulty with producing 
or comprehending speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia, vertigo, dysarthria. Denies focal muscle weakness, 
numbness, parasthesia. Denies loss of sensation. Denies 
difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or 
chills.  Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain 
or tightness, palpitations.  Denies vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or 
bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. 
Denies rash.

IMAGING
=======
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___.  Relatively hyperdense large subdural hematoma along the left 
cerebral 
convexity, with biconvex regions more inferiorly, which could 
represent a 
component of epidural hemorrhage.  No evidence of calvarial 
fracture. 
2.  Bilateral low-density frontal subdural collections likely 
represent old hematomas or hygromas. 
3.  Associated bilateral frontal mass-effect, denoted by sulcal 
effacement.  No shift of normally midline structures. 

CTA HEAD/NECK ___:
1. Stable large left subdural hematoma up to 2.5 cm with stable 
mass effect. 
2. Stable small hypodense right subdural collection, compatible 
with hygroma versus chronic hematoma, up to 0.7 cm. 
3. Slit-like ventricles, effacement of the perimesencephalic 
cisterns, and 
sagging of the brainstem and corpus callosum suggestive of 
intracranial 
hypotension.  Please refer to the subsequent brain MRI report 
for further 
detail. 
4. Normal CTA of the head and neck. 
5. No evidence for dural venous sinus thrombosis. 

MRI C/T/L SPINE W/ AND W/O CONTRAST ___:
1. There are multilevel perineural cysts, large in the sacrum, 
as described above.  No pericystic fluid collection to suggest 
active CSF leakage (although this is very infrequently seen). 
The largest perineural cyst in the cervical spine appears 
slightly irregular at the left C6-7 level. 
2. Moderate to severe spinal canal narrowing at C5-C6 with 
effacement of CSF around the spinal cord, but no evidence for 
cord signal abnormalities. 
3. Mild lumbar degenerative disease.

MRI HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST ___:
1. Stable large left convexity subdural hemorrhage with stable 
mass effect. 
2. Stable small right subdural hygroma. 
3. Diffuse pachymeningeal contrast enhancement, slit-like 
ventricles, mild 
downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils, and other 
above-described 
findings are highly suggestive of intracranial hypotension. 

CT ORBITS W/ THIN CUTS THROUGH TEMPORAL BONE ___:
1. No findings to indicate or localize a CSF leak. 
2. Intracranial findings were better seen on recent MRI brain.
3. Chronic partial left contraction from chronic inflammation. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman who presented with headache worse 
after sitting up and coughing, found to have large atraumatic L 
SDH. Vascular etiologies including AVM, aneurysm, DVST were 
evaluated with CTA/CTV head which was unremarkable. While she 
has some history of easy bruising the last year she has no 
coagulopathy per her INR/PTT.

Given the findings of intracranial hypotension on her MRI, as 
well as the positional nature of her headache, most likely 
etiology of her SDH is a CSF leak. Possible sources include the 
spine, as well as the inner ear, especially given her history of 
perforated TM. An MRI of the spine was obtained and showed no 
overt CSF leak, but did show numerous perineural cysts, placing 
her at risk for CSF leak. CT of the temporal bone was obtained 
to evaluate for possible CSF otorrhea, but this was 
unremarkable. 

Anesthesia was consulted for epidural blood patch, given the 
high clinical suspicion for occult CSF leak. However, the 
patient declined this, and opted instead for close outpatient 
monitoring and conservative management of her headache. She will 
have a repeat head CT in ___ days (as an outpatient) to 
evaluate the SDH. For symptomatic management, we would recommend 
aggressive PO hydration, Tylenol, warm compresses, and caffeine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

You were in the hospital because you had a headache. We found 
that you had a bleed around the surface of your brain. We 
believe that this bleed was caused by a leak of the fluid that 
surrounds your brain (cerebrospinal fluid).

In the hospital, we did several scans to look for a leak of 
fluid, but we did not find any.

When you leave the hospital, you should continue to take your 
same medicines. For your headache, we would recommend you drink 
plenty of fluids. Caffeine can also be helpful.

If you have any worsening headache, vision changes, trouble 
speaking, or weakness, you should call your doctor or return to 
the Emergency Department. 

Best wishes,
Your ___ team
