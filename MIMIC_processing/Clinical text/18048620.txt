==============
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo ___ male with DM and Hep B (no 
reported cirrhosis) who presented to ___ with 3 days of 
black stools and orthostasis and found to have an upper GI bleed 
secondary to duodenal ulcer.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#) DUODENAL ULCER BLEED
Patient presented with 3 days of melena, fatigue and 
orthostasis. Initially found to be orthostatic but otherwise 
hemodynamically stable with a hemoglobin of 7 (unknown 
baseline). Received a total of 3U PRBCs (2 at the OSH and one at 
___. EGD demonstrated Grade A esophagitis, erosion in the 
gastric antrum, and a single cratered 10 mm ulcer in the 
duodenal bulb. Antral biopsies were performed for h.pylori. 
Patient was started on IV pantoprazole 40 mg. Aspirin was held 
for bleeding risk, and patient was instructed to hold aspirin 
indefinitely (given only for primary prophylaxis). Diet was 
advanced as tolerated after EGD. GI recommends BID PPI for 8 
weeks followed by 20 mg indefinitely (if aspirin resumed).

#) THROMBOCYTOPENIA
Found to have mild thrombocytopenia likely secondary to acute 
blood loss. Needs to have outpatient follow up.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#) DM: held home oral agents, received ISS while inpatient

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================================
#) Needs to continue omeprazole 40mg BID for 8 weeks. Then can 
decrease to 20mg daily.
#) Patient instructed to hold aspirin. Should have ongoing 
discussions with PCP regarding benefits/risks of primary 
prevention with aspirin given GI bleed. If resume aspirin, 
should continue omeprazole 20mg indefinitely.
#) Need to follow up results from biopsy. If shows H.pylori, 
will need treatment, and then testing for cure.
#) Needs a CBC at PCP follow up within 1 week
#) Found to have mild thrombocytopenia, consider further 
outpatient workup
#) Needs to have outpatient abdominal ultrasound and hepatitis 
serologies given history of HBV. Consider referral to hepatology 
if has chronic hepatitis B
#) Lisinopril held on discharge given bleed. Need to monitor 
hypertension and resume lisinopril as needed.
