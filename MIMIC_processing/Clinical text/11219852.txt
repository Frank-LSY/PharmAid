IMAGING
-------

___ CXR
No acute findings.

___ TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There 
is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with 
Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: No definite cardiac source of syncope identified. 
Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function. No definite pathologic 
valvular flow identified on the limited views obtained.  

___ L KNEE X-RAY
No definite fracture of the left knee.  Small left knee joint 
effusion.  
Cross-sectional imaging could be considered for further 
evaluation if 
clinically warranted. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ y/o woman with history of dementia who 
presented from an outside hospital after a fall complicated by 
multiple facial fractures.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------

# Mechanical fall:
The patient presented after a fall. Patient limited historian 
but denied antecedent cardiac symptoms to her fall. Troponins 
negative x2 and EKG without acute ischemic changes. No murmur on 
exam to suggest valvular pathology as cause of syncope. TTE 
without significant abnormalities to explain event. No acute 
events on telemetry. PE also less likely given lack of 
tachycardia, hypoxemia, and other pulmonary symptoms. History 
was not consistent with seizure. Seen by physical therapy who 
recommended discharge to rehab. Also seen by occupational 
therapy who also recommended rehab, as well as follow up for ADL 
train, patient education, cognitive retraining, functional 
training. Psychiatry was consulted as below given concern about 
patient's ability to have capacity to make disposition 
decisions.

# Facial fractures: 
Secondary to fall. Evaluated by plastic surgery and found to 
have no acute surgical needs. Also seen by ophthalmology, found 
to have no acute issues. Patient experienced minimal pain which 
was well controlled with Tylenol. However, fractures were 
complicated by tissue swelling and nasal congestion. Speech and 
swallow was consulted and found no evidence of overt aspiration 
and  recommended soft diet which was advanced as tolerated by 
the patient and can be advanced as tolerated. The patient should 
follow up with ophthalmology and plastic surgery as detailed 
below.

# Dementia
# Lack of capacity
# Temporary guardianship:
Patient with history of dementia, last MOCA 18. Seen recently by 
neurology for progressive cognitive decline. B12, folate, TSH 
and RPR unremarkable. BIDCO/Elder services involved due to 
concerns that patient is unable to care for self. Psychiatry was 
consulted for formal evaluation of capacity. Patient was found 
to NOT have capacity and temporary guardianship was pursued. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
[] Plastic Surgery clinic f/u in ___ weeks (Dr. ___, 
___  
[] Follow up outpatient ophthalmology ___ weeks after discharge 
(___)
[] Advance diet as tolerated.
[] Needs MRI brain given dementia and prior survey for metal 
implant
