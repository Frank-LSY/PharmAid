and
is concerned this may be an effect of her citalopram. Reports

her parents would judge her as being cowardly or taking the easy
way out.

bright affect, smiling with occasional laughter. She reports 
that

starting Venlafaxine XR and Hydroxyzine medication, and risks 
and benefits of possible alternatives, including not taking the 
medication, with this patient.   We discussed the patient's 
right to decide whether to take this medication as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any  questions about medications with 
the treatment team, and I  answered the patient's questions.  
The patient appeared able to understand and consented to begin 
the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon suicidal thoughts 
with plan to overdose on over the counter medications and 
worsening depressive symptoms.  Their static factors noted at 
that time include trauma, history of self-injurious behavior, 
quasi-suicide attempt, Caucasian race, age, LGBT identity.   The 
modifiable risk factors addressed were hopelessness, depression, 
insomnia, poor energy, anhedonia.  These were addressed by 
starting Venalafaxine.  These were also addressed by groups and 
milieu therapy as well as individual sessions with treatment 
team.  Poor/limited coping skills were also addressed by 
group/milieu therapy.  Finally, the patient is being discharged 
with many protective risk factors: positive romantic 
relationship with her best friend, stable housing, help-seeking, 
future-oriented, positive relationship with previous therapist 
(who is still willing to see her over Skype), no history of 
substance abuse, and most importantly lack of SI.  Overall 
patient reports feeling much better and has improved mood.  She 
reports feeling refreshed and is if she can handle her life.  
Based on the totality of our assessment at this time, the 
patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others.
