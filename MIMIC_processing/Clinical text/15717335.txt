Chief Complaint:
Acute loss of vision in R eye
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ ambidextrous man with a history of 
hyperlipidemia and episodes of blurred vision and dizziness 
thought possibly to be related to a migrainous phenomenon who 
now presents with an episode of complete vision loss in his 
right eye. He reports that he was feeling well until about 9am 
this morning, when his vision began to go blurry. He says this 
felt similar to the episodes he has had in the past, although it 
seemed to be more confined to his right eye. Shortly thereafter 
he suddenly lost vision in his right eye. It happened rather 
quickly and he does not recall a shade coming down, just that 
his vision suddenly went black. When he covered his right eye he 
could see normally out of his left eye. His vision was 
completely black for ___ minutes, after which he began to see 
splotches of intense blue and green colors that were moving 
around, along with flashing lights. There was also a black spot 
in his vision which also seemed to be moving. This lasted for a 
few minutes, after which his vision slowly began to come back. 
He reports that it seemed to come back in pieces, and the inner 
lower quadrant was the slowest to return. He describes "prickly 
lights" like a starry sky in this quadrant as the rest of his 
vision returned. Finally after a period of about 10 minutes 
total from the beginning of his symptoms his vision came back to 
normal. He denies any pain in the eye or associated headache. He 
has never had anything like this before. He wears glasses and 
says he has noticed a slow decrease in visual acuity in his 
right eye over the last few months and thought he needed to get 
his glasses adjusted. He has not seen an eye doctor in about ___ 
years.

Currently his vision is completely back to his baseline. He 
denies any other symptoms including headache, dizziness, 
weakness, numbness, difficulty walking. He does report a GI 
illness over the weekend with nausea/vomiting but denies any 
other recent illnesses or fever/chills. He has also been dealing 
with kidney stones over the last month. ROS is otherwise 
negative throughout.

Of note he had previously been on aspirin 81mg daily for the 
last ___ years but stopped taking it 3 weeks ago as he had been 
scheduled for a lithotripsy. This was subsequently canceled but 
he had not yet restarted taking his aspirin. Today after his 
episode of vision loss he took two baby aspirin before coming to 
the ED.

 
Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia
Hypothyroidism
Aortic root dilation
PVC's
Multiple episodes of bilateral blurred vision, dizziness, and
nausea for the last ___ years. A previous cardiac work-up had
been negative but he had a second cardiac work-up after a more
severe episode last ___ including a stress echo which showed
mild aortic root dilation. He is currently followed by ___ in ___. Routine EEG was negative. MRI
brain showed a small area of gliosis in the R parietal region. 
He
was started on notriptyline in ___ with the thought that
these could represent migrainous phenomena, and these episodes
have actually resolved since then.
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
His father at ___ had some stroke like symptoms.  
He is not aware of any seizure or migraine history in
this family.

Brief Hospital Course:
#TIA
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of 
hyperlipidemia and episodes of blurred vision and dizziness 
thought possibly to be related to a migrainous phenomenon who 
presented with an episode of complete vision loss in his right 
eye. A CT/CTA done in the ER did not demonstrate an acute 
intracranial process. He was admitted to the stroke service 
where he did not develop any new episodes of visual blurring, 
loss of vision, or visual disturbances. Visual acquity, visual 
fields examination, assessment of pupillary reflex and 
fundoscopic examination remained unremarkable. An MRI brain 
without contrast did not show an acute infarct.

As part of his stroke risk factor screening, a trans-thoracic 
echo was done, which showed a mildly dilated aortic root, but no 
thrombus or shunt. His LDL was noted to be 71 and HbA1c was 5.4. 
He was restarted on aspirin 81mg PO daily, as he had previously 
discontinued it in preparation for a lithotripsy procedure. He 
was also continued on Simvastatin 20mg daily.

Mr. ___ was discharged in stable condition. He will follow 
up as outpatient with his primary neurologist, Dr. ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of blurred vision and 
dizziness
resulting from an TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
TEMPORARILY blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.
TIA can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
1. High cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows:
1. RESUMING your baby ASA 81mg

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Your echo did not show any clot. 

We will call you with your cholesterol results.

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.

 
Followup Instructions:
