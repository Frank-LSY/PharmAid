Chief Complaint:
Carotid stenosis 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___: Diagnostic Angiogram with left carotid angioplasty
 
History of Present Illness:
___ right-handed male who was found to have a carotid 
bruit and was seen at ___.  At that point, 
his left carotid was seen to be 50-79% narrow, right was less 
than 50%.  He had a CTA recently, which showed near total 
occlusion of the carotid in the neck and may be occlusion of the 
intracavernous carotid.  He is here for consideration of further 
treatment.  He is on an aspirin, but has not been started on a 
statin yet. He would benefit from a diagnostic angiogram to look 
at the status of his cranial circulation.  If he is completely 
occluded in its distal intracavernous carotid, there would be no 
need to intervene on his left carotid stenosis in the neck.  
Plan is to perform an angiogram and with the patient on Plavix 
and aspirin, so that way, a stent could be done if necessary.
