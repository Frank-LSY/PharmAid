CTA chest (___):
1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, as above more extensive
on the left than the right. 
2. Mild straightening of the interventricular septum can be
concerning for right heart strain.  Echocardiogram would provide
further assessment.

Patient presented to PCP ___ 3 weeks of ___ swelling and pain

pulmonary artery measuring 3.0 cm. Trop/BNP WNL. TTE showed
mildly dilated, normally functioning RV with mild pulmonary HTN
(as well as mild symmetric LVH with nl regional/global systolic
function). Orthostatics were nl, as was ambulatory saturation on
RA. Discussed with ___ fellow (Dr. ___, who felt 
that
___ invasive interventions were warranted based on stability.
Unclear precipitant for DVT/PE, likely unprovoked in absence of
recent immobility and given that he is up-to-date on his
