Pertinent Results:
EGD report ___:
Indications: ___ yo M w/Hx of DM and HTN recently diagnosed w/ALS
 
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential 
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his 
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A 
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered MAC 
anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen was used. The patient was placed 
in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was 
introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct 
visualization until the third part of the duodenum was reached. 
Careful visualization of the upper GI tract was performed. The 
procedure was not difficult. The patient tolerated the procedure 
well. There were no complications. 
Findings: 
Esophagus: Normal esophagus. 

Stomach: Normal stomach. 

Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 

Other
procedures: The stomach was inflated with air, and by a 
combination of transillumination and manual palpation, the site 
for the gastrostomy tube placement was selected and marked on 
the anterior abdominal wall. The skin of the anterior abdomen 
was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Utilizing strict 
sterile technique, the selected site was then anesthetized with 
1% xylocaine by injection into the skin and subcutaneous tissue. 
 A small incision was made.  The needle/cannula assembly was 
then passed through the abdominal wall and through the anterior 
wall of the stomach, maintaining visualization with the 
endoscope.  A snare device was placed through the instrument 
channel, opened and placed around the cannula then the wire was 
inserted and snared. The needle was removed, then the snare was 
then pulled up to the endoscope distal tip, and the scope was 
then withdrawn bringing with it the snare and insertion wire. A 
___ ___ Endovive PEG tube was then inserted 
through the mouth and pulled through the needle insertion site. 
The guidewire was removed.  The PEG tube was pulled snug with 
the external bumper at 4.5cm.  The external bolster was placed 
over the tube to secure it to the abdominal wall. A sterile 
dressing was then applied, and the procedure completed. 

Impression: Successful ___ PEG placement. 
 

Recommendations: Admit to hospital for overnight monitoring. 
Meds and flushes x first 24 hours
Advance diet with tube feeds following tube check by ERCP 
Fellow tomorrow AM.

 

Additional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. ___ 
___ the GI fellow. The attending was present for the entire 
procedure. FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression section 
above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No specimens were taken for 
pathology 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y.o man with h.o ALS c/b dysphagia and 
respiratory difficulties, HTN, DM who presented for monitoring 
following PEG placement. Given progressive weight loss recently, 
nutrition was consulted and recommended starting tube feeds 
while inpatient to monitor to make sure they were tolerated 
before sending him home to continue tube feedings there. Also he 
is diabetic (only on oral hypoglycemics currently) so blood 
sugars were also monitored while tube feedings were started 
which were normal. He tolerated the initiation of tube feeds up 
to the goal rate well, without any significant GI symptoms.  Per 
neurology Dr. ___ saw him while inpatient, "strongly 
recommended that he takes 100% of his nutrition via the PEG at 
this time.  The length of time that he will need this is his 
entire lifetime at this point." so he was made NPO and will go 
home with services including nursing to help with tube feeds at 
home. Rest of hospital course/plan are outlined below.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear. Mr. ___, 

You were admitted for a PEG tube placement in your stomach to 
start tube feedings because it is no longer safe to take food by 
mouth. The PEG tube was placed without complications and you 
were initiated on tube feedings while in the hospital which you 
tolerated well. 

Please continue to use your BIPAP as instructed. You should also 
take nothing by mouth given your risk of aspirating food into 
your lungs. 

You should follow up with your outpatient providers as below.
