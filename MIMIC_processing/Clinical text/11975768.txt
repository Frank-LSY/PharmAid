Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted because you began bleeding in the intestines 
after your ERCP. They repeated the procedure and stopped the 
bleeding. Unfortunately you developed pancreatitis after the 
procedure, but that improved with fluids through your IV and 
pain medications. We watched you to ensure the bleeding had 
stopped and that your blood counts were stable.

Please make sure to follow up with your doctors.

___ wish you the best,
Your ___ team
