History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with the past medical
history of CAD s/p stent placement (___), hyperlipidemia, and
prior h/o lyme disease presenting with headache, high grade
fevers and concern for recurrent lyme disease refractory to po
antibiotics. 

Patient was sent here by PCP for failing PO antibiotics for
presumptive lyme treatment. Patient states he was in his usual
state of health until 1 week ago, when he experienced acute 
onset
fever, up to 103 at home, chills, headache, severe night sweats,
neck stiffness and lower back pain. He subsequently noticed a
"target-like" rash on left posterior thigh on ___ and was
evaluated at ___. He thinks he may have been
bitten by a tick, but unsure. 

As per patient, work-up at ___ included CT Head
which patient reports was negative and LP with results pending.
He was discharged on PO clarithromycin 500mg BID, Doxycycline
100mg PO BID and Diclofenac. After being discharged, he noticed
progression of rash with multiple target-like lesions in
bilateral lower extremities and abdomen. He was seen by his PCP
yesterday and was given ceftriaxone 1gm IM. Today he states he
has occasional fevers and chills that are intermittent, neck
stiffness, and lower back pain. Rash is not pruritic. Due to
concern for worsening symptoms he was told by his PCP to present
to the ED for IV antibiotics. 

With regards to his back pain, he reports that this has improved
since Teusday and now only mild intermittent. His headache is
triggered by tension and pain in his neck and has been somewhat
responsive to diclofenac. 

Patient has previous history of lyme disease ___ years ago at 
which
time he presented with joint pains and was treated with
resolution of symptoms and no issues since. He was seen by his
PCP in ___ and complained of overall low energy and fatigue 
and
had repeat lyme serologies which were found to be positive.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ with CAD s/p stent placement (___), 
hyperlipidemia, and prior h/o lyme disease presenting with 
headache, high grade fevers and concern for recurrent early lyme 
disease, initially thought refractory to PO antibiotics.

# Fever
# Headache
# Myalgia
# Fatigue
# Multiple erythema migrans rash
# Early localized Lyme disease: S/p two OSH visits with 
reportedly reassuring head CT, basic laboratories with modestly 
elevated LFT, LP with mildly elevated protein only with multiple 
arthropod vector studies sent; diagnosed with tick born disease 
and started on doxy and clarithromycin. Continued symptoms and 
so ultimately admitted here and started on Ceftriaxone. Seen by 
ID, who felt symptoms, labs, exam were consistent with early 
localized Lyme disease, and thought that initial worsening after 
doxycycline represented either response latency vs a spirochetal 
Jarix-___ reaction. OSH CSF Lyme PCR negative, blood Lyme 
AB screen negative. OSH babesia DNA negative. 
- Doxycycline 100 BID for 21 days for early localized Lyme 
disease
  - Counselled on doxy precautions - esophagitis, sun exposure
- Follow up pending labs: blood RPR and blood cultures from 
here; blood Anaplasma antibodies, CSF VZV, CSF WNV, CSF culture 
from OSH
- Consider repeating Lyme titer in 2 weeks given initial 
negative

# Transaminitis: Improving at time of discharge. Thought to be 
most likely due to Lyme disease, though Anaplasma coinfection is 
possible. ID recommended holding Clarithromycin given 
improvement.
- F/u OSH Anaplasma studies as above

# Microhematuria: In OSH lab workup, UA showed small number of 
RBCs.
- Outpatient PCP followup, patient notified of result

# CAD
# HL: Stable. Continued home medication regimen.

Billing: >30 minutes spent coordinating discharge
