symptoms, including meditation, exercise, and distraction.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout his admission. He was also placed on 15 minute checks 
status on admission and remained on that level of observation 
throughout while being unit restricted. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Mood disorder:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with past psychiatric history 
of mood disorder, w/ multiple past suicide attempts, who 
presented from his outpatient provider's office with signs 
concerning for a mixed episode and multiple recent suicide 
attempts.  On initial interaction, the patient reported that he 
had long-standing depressed mood and multiple self-depreciating 
thoughts. He noted that since stopping his antidepressant, he 
has demonstrated significant improvement in his mood, decreased 
need for sleep (72 hours), pressured speech, and goal-directed 
behavior (excessive studying). The patient also has attempted 
suicide twice before his presentation and was making provocative 
statements about cutting himself to his therapist. 
Diagnostically, patient's initial presentation was concerning 
for BPAD w/ psychotic features. Patient's social disengagement, 
concrete thought process, and symptoms of decompensated mood 
disorder, are suggestive of early onset of primary psychotic 
disorder, like schizoaffective disorder.

The primary team decided to start Arpiprazole to help treat the 
mixed features of the patient's episode. He was increased to a 
discharge dose of 15 mg daily total.  Lamotrigine was 
discontinued to minimize the number of medications necessary for 
the patient to take.  He was continued on clonazepam 1 mg po QHS 
and given hydroxyzine 25 mg po Q6H PRN anxiety. 

Patient demonstrated significant improvement in affective 
symptoms. Patient also appeared better able to engage in 
interview and with others on the unit. Patient reported that his 
mood, thoughts of self harm, and socialization had not been at 
this level in ___ years. Patient reported cessation of suicidal 
thoughts. Patient was eager to engage in the milieu. Given 
patient's complex presentation and past symptoms, he underwent 
neuropsychiatric testing, which demonstrated concrete thought 
process, depressive symptoms, and minimization of symptoms. The 
results of the neuropsychological testing were concerning for 
early onset of a primary psychotic disorder, like 
schizoaffective disorder. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#)NONE

4. MEDICAL
#)HYPOTHYROIDISM:
On admission, Mr. ___ TSH was elevated at 8.0 and free T4 
of 1.9. The patient was restarted on his home dose of 
levothyroxine 75 mcg PO daily. 

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patients primary team met with them daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
The primary team was in contact with the providers at his 
___ to ease his transition back to the community.

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: The patient was started on medications to help 
treat his mixed episode.
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: The patient had appointments with 
his outpatient providers.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.  We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I 
answered the patient's questions. The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself and/or others based upon his 
hypomanic and depressive features as well as the multiple recent 
suicide attempts and self-injurious behaviors. Their static 
factors noted at that time included a history of suicide 
attempts, male gender, age, and marital status.   The modifiable 
risk factors were also addressed at that time. The patient was 
started on medications to help reduce his mood symptoms.  He was 
provided psychoeducation on his mental illness to try to improve 
his poor insight into the disorder. We worked with the patient's 
sister to try to maximize his support after discharge. Finally, 
the patient is being discharged with many protective risk 
factors, help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint,  
positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, and 
strong social supports.  Overall, based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is guarded due to symptom severity 
(both mood and psychotic), history of high risk suicide 
attempts, social and cognitive deficits. However, patient has 
strong family and community support, and appeared highly 
motivated to maintain his health at discharge.
