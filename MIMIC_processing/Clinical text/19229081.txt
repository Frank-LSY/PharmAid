fall
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Patient is an ___ female with a history of hypertension
and osteoporosis presenting with leg pain from recurrent falls.
Patient has a history of recurrent falls, most recently a few
days ago (___). Patient states that she fell because she
lost her balance while carrying heavy items in the kitchen. She
does not describe any precipitating chest pain, dizziness, loss
of consciousness, or weakness. Patient estimates that she has
fallen 3 times in the last week. She also notes hitting her
shins/ankles against the stairs last week resulting in pain in
the lower anterior shin bilaterally. She initially presented to
___, where CT imaging showed multiple spinal fractures of
varying chronicity as well as left femoral head osteonecrosis,
collapse, and fragmentation, resulting in flattening of the
superior femoral head. She was transferred to ___ for
trauma evaluation and further management. Labs were notable for
WBC 5, Hct 29.6, and a positive UA. CT head showed a small SAH,
and MRI spine revealed acute T11 compression fracture as well as
other subacute and/or chronic spin fractures. Neurosurgery was
consulted and recommended no further imaging or follow up for 
her
SAH. Spine surgery was consulted and recommended that the 
patient
be fitted for a TLSO brace and that she follow up as an
outpatient. Orthopedic surgery was consulted and recommended
non-operative management, WBAT, and likely outpatient
arthroplasty. ACS is now consulted for trauma assessment. 

Currently, the patient is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
She reports pain in her left lower extremity, focused around the
hip. She denies any nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills. She has
no dizziness or headache. She does not note any visual changes.
She has no chest pain or shortness of breath. She does not
describe any stool incontinence, urinary retention, or saddle
anesthesia. She has no changes with regards to her urination,
denying burning or pain. Since her fall, patient has been unable
to ambulate secondary to pain in her left hip. On exam, she is
neurologically in tact. She has a large ecchymosis overlying her
right thigh/hip which is non tender, and she is tender to
palpation along the left hip and thigh as well as over her lower
thoracic spine and bilateral ankles.

TTE
Severe aortic valve stenosis with thickened/calcified leaflets 
and mild to moderate
aortic regurgitation. Normal left ventricular wall thickness and 
biventricular cavity sizes and
regional/global systolic function. Moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

MRI spine
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Acute/subacute T11 compression fracture, mild height loss. 
2. Multilevel chronic compression fractures thoracic, lumbar 
spine. 
3. Degenerative changes spine. 
4. Moderate central canal narrowing cervical spine, partially 
imaged. 
5. Mild central canal narrowing thoracic, lumbar spine. 
6. Multilevel foraminal narrowing, as above. 

CT C-spine
1. No acute fracture of the cervical spine.  Minimal 
retrolisthesis of C3 over 
C4 and C5 over C6 of indeterminate age given lack of priors for 
comparison, 
but most likely degenerative. 

CT T-spine
1. Extensive fractures throughout the imaged thoracic and lumbar 
spine, some 
probably chronic, but some acute or subacute. 
2. Acute or subacute compression fractures include T9 and T11. 
3. A probably chronic burst fracture at T12 results in 
approximately 4 mm of 
retropulsion and at least moderate spinal canal narrowing. 

CT Head
Subtle focal 4 mm hyperdensity best seen on coronal and sagittal 
images in the 
right periventricular occipital region, possibly representing a 
tiny focus of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage versus small cavernoma.  This finding 
was not seen on 
prior CT from ___. 
  
Global involutional changes.  Extensive bilateral 
periventricular subcortical 
white matter hypodensities may be sequela of chronic small 
vessel disease. 

XR Pelvis and Femur
FINDINGS:  
  
As seen on CT performed earlier today, there is left femoral 
head 
osteonecrosis, collapse, and fragmentation, better assessed on 
CT.  Uncovering 
of the proximal tip of the dynamic screw in the proximal left 
femur was better 
appreciated on CT.  The appearance of the bilateral hips is 
stable compared to 
earlier today.  Hardware in the bilateral femurs again seen.  
The bones are 
relatively osteopenic. 
  
No fracture of the more distal left femur.  There is no 
suprapatellar joint 
effusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ with PMHx notable for HTN, gait
instability, hypothyroidism (not on medication), osteoporosis
(previously declined specific treatment), cataracts s/p surgery,
AS per physical exam (no ECHO) who was admitted on ___ after a
fall, found to have small SAH, chronic left femoral head
osteonecrosis/collapse/fragmentation, T9+11 compression 
fracture,
T12 burst fracture (retropulsion), and chronic L2 compression
fracture. Patient was evaluated by trauma surgery/neurosurgery,
admitted to ___ without any need for acute surgical 
intervention.
Transfer to medicine on ___. She had an echo which showed severe 
AS, but this was not felt to have contributed to her syncope.

# Gait instability
# Fall s/p polytrauma
# Small SAH
# Chronic left femoral head osteonecrosis/collapse/fragmentation
in setting of advanced arthritic hip 
# T9 + T11 compression fracture
# T12 burst fracture
# Chronic L2 compression fracture
Pt had unwitnessed fall. Per report, is prone to falls and has
gait instability. Pt described a mechanical etiology of fall to
multiple providers. Pt feeling in USOH at time of fall and had
no prodrome associated. TTE showed severe AS, but without 
syncope unlikely to have caused fall. TLSO brace should be 
donned at the edge of bed and when out of bed at all times. 
Patient is s/p bilateral hip fractures status post right CMN and 
left sliding hip screw ___ years ago at ___). 
No indication
for acute surgical intervention, however may benefit from hip 
arthroplasty since pain from her hip seems to be contributing to 
her frequent falls. WBAT BLE, Follow up with Dr. ___ is 
___ weeks. 

#Severe AS
Gradient 39, valve area 1.0. Not currently symptomatic, no
indication for acute intervention. TI to f/u w cardiology.

___ - Resolved.
Baseline 0.9-1.3. Likely not much from baseline. Held lisinopril 
and gave IVF.

# Asymptomatic bactiuria/pyuria
Pt admission UA with 8WBCs +nitrite growing E. Coli >100K. Pt is 
asymptomatic. Received 3d cefpodoxime

# ___ aspiration
RN noted pt to be coughing post swallowing ___ aspiration. Pt 
reports she coughs often with PO intake. OMR documents history 
of an esophageal web. SLP eval declined by pt and family, and 
they accepted aspiration risks.

# HTN
Held lisinopril, continued amlodipine

# Hypothyroidism, mild

# Osteoporosis
Previously per PCP, pt had declined specific treatment for this
