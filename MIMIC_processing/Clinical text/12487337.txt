These steps can help you recover after your procedure. 
DO drink plenty of water to flush out the bladder.

constipation. Ask your doctor if you should take a laxative if 
you do become constipated.

it's OK. 
Don't do any strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 
four to six weeks or until your doctor says it's OK.

activity in about four to six weeks.

drive once your catheter is removed and you're no longer taking 
prescription pain medications. 

You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve. You may 
have clear or yellow urine that periodically turns pink/red 
throughout the healing process. Generally, the discoloration of 
the urine is OK unless it transitions from ___, 
___ Aid to a very dark, thick or like tomato juice

medication changes and your post-operative course with your 
primary care team.  

Unless otherwise advised, blood thinning medications like

after discharge or save until your Foley catheter is removed 
(called a trial of void or void trial).
