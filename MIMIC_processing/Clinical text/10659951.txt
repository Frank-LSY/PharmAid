History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ right handed man with PMH significant for
HTN, HLD and chronic LBP who presents with stuttering onset of
vertigo. The patient reports that ___ at 2 pm he had
the gradual onset of room spinning vertigo while watching TV. 
The
room was spinning clockwise. If he kept perfectly still the
symptom would abate but with any movement he would be spinning
again. This lasted until 11pm that night when the patient went 
to
sleep. once he was in bed the symptoms resolved. He did not have
associated N/V or headache at the time. 

The symptoms returned on ___ at noon; he was again
watching TV. again with clockwise room spinning. The spinning
came and went throughout the day without any clear trigger. when
spinning, movement made things worse, but movement alone did not
trigger the spinning. This continued throughout the day and into
the night. The patient was able to fall asleep but he woke up at
3am to go to the bathroom and found that he could not walk. The
spinning had become relentless and he continues to spin at this
point. Even when he is perfectly still the sx continues. He
denies N/V, hearing changes or ear fullness. He has not been 
sick
at all recently. He denies any additional neurologic symptoms. 

He has had a similar episode once about a year ago where he felt
dizzy and fell down, but he reports that he was not really
spinning the way he currently is. Those symptoms lasted about 1
day and resolved spontaneously.

to be a lag followed by corrective saccade with head turn to the

PERTINENT LABS:

DISCHARGE LABS:

IMAGES:
___ CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

___ CT Head
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarction. 
2. Prominent ventricles in a person of this age may represent 
central atrophy. 
3.  Mild periventricular white matter hypodensities may reflect 
the sequela of chronic microvascular infarction. 

___ MRI Head
1.  No acute intracranial process.  Multiple scattered foci of 
T2/FLAIR high signal intensity in the subcortical and 
periventricular white matter, which are nonspecific and may 
reflect changes due to small vessel disease. 
2.  No acute vascular abnormalities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ right handed man with PMH significant for 
HTN, HLD and chronic LBP who presents with stuttering onset of 
vertigo and truncal ataxia. CT and MRI with chronic ischemic 
small vessel changes, but no signs of acute or subacute infarct. 
Given the clinical presentation and examination, this is most 
consistent with an MRI negative stroke. Pt was also tested for 
thiamine deficiency (pending at time of discharge) and 
prophylactically treated with 3 day course of 500mg thiamine and 
daily folate.  His stroke was thought to be secondary to small 
vessel ischemic disease from longstanding hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia.  Since admission to the hospital, Mr. ___ has 
been normotensive. His home lisinopril-HCTZ and  amlodipine were 
stopped. His metoprolol was reduced by ___. For his 
hyperlipidemia, he is on atorvastatin. He is not a non smoker.  
HA1c pending but appears to not be diabetic as FSBG have been 
WNLs throughout admission. Will follow. For secondary stroke 
prevention, he was started on aspirin.  He was seen by ___ 
with recommendation for discharge to rehabilitation facility due 
to unsteady gait.

====================
Transitional Issues:
====================
- Will need close PCP ___ for monitoring of his blood 
pressure and other stroke risk factors. We have stopped his 
amiodarone, lisinopril and HCTZ as his BPs were normotensive 
during admission. Possible/question that patient was not taking 
these medications at home.
- Needs to schedule outpatient transthoracic echocardiogram 
(TTE) with bubble study to assess for PFO.
- ___ cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c, as stroke risk 
factors. ___ need medication adjustments pending results.
- ___ thiamine level (send out lab).
- Elevated creatinine during hospital admission. Will need PCP 
___.
- Hemoglobin A1c was pending at discharge. This will need to be 
followed by PCP.
