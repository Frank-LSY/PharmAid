Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service on ___

doing better, tolerating a regular diet, pain is better 
controlled, and you are ready to be discharged to home to 
continue your recovery.

Please note the following discharge instructions:

your surgical incision.

feel you could respond in an emergency.

to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.

o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow (___) you may shower and remove the gauzes over 
your incisions. Under these dressing you may have steristrip 
which will fall off in ___ days on their own. If you have 
dermabond glue it will gradually dissolve over time. If you have

medicines without a prescription.

mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.

surgeon has said its okay.
