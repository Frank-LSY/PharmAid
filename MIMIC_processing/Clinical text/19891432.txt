History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M Mass ___ student w/ no inpatient 
psychiatric hospitalizations, no outpatient treaters presenting 
with worsening depressive symptoms and escalating self harming 
behaviors including repetitive head banging and cutting. 
.
Patient reports that in the setting of multiple psychosocial 
stressors including recent breakup increasing stress with school 
assignments, uncertainty with career goals he has experienced 
worsening "fully body depression." On clarification he describes 
this as being "fully engulfing" with feelings of hollowness, 
dissociation, sensation of pain." In an attempt to "alleviate" 
this feeling patient reports banging his head and cutting his 
arms and legs with a razor which has been increasing (frequency 
and severity) over the past week. On ___ patient reports 
taking his fists and banging them against the sides of his head 
in a "rhythmic" fashion. Per doctor's appointment at ___ 
___, patient met clinical criteria for mild 
concussive episode. Patient reports that he only stopped banging 
his head because of the pain to his head but acknowledges that 
it "helped" him feel better. Patient has difficulty vocalizing 
as to how this "helped." Patient reports an increase in 
frequency of cutting behaviors with a box cutter on his left 
upper arm. Patient reports long history of head banging since he 
was a kid, and cutting behaviors starting in high school. Per 
patient, the cutting and head banging helped "relieve" the 
emotional pain and has never been in an attempt to end his life. 
Over the last several years, patient has noticed that he has to 
escalate the severity of cutting and head banging to feel the 
same sense of relief.
.
In further discussion Mr. ___ characterizes his current 
emotion state as "freak outs." During these "freak outs" he 
reports suicidal thoughts, low mood, feelings of anger and 
sadness, "hard to even pretend that I'm happy." He endorses 
isolation, avoidance, not wanting to move, and self directed 
anger. Patient reports that he has experienced "freak outs" 
before but notes that the frequency of his freak outs have been 
increasing (3 in the past week) and have been more severe 
(severe head banging).
.
Mr. ___ endorses insomnia (difficulty falling asleep and 
early morning awakenings), poor concentration, feelings of 
guilt, "unstable" mood, low energy, lack of motivation, poor 
concentration, and decreased appetite. He reports profound 
hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness and occasional self 
derogatory thoughts. Patient also denies future orientation 
noting "don't think I've ever had a positive outlook on the 
future." Although he enjoys school, he notes that recently he 
walked into the ___ studio looked at his work and went home. 
Patient endorses passive suicidal thoughts that occurred 
yesterday but denies suicidal thoughts at this time. He said 
that yesterday and in the past, when he has thoughts of suicidal 
ideation he can remind himself of the consequences of it and can 
"usually talk myself down from it.""
.
In the ED, patient was calm and cooperative and did not require 
any physical or chemical restraints. He utilized PRN Ativan 
0.5mg and PRN Hydroxyzine 25mg for anxiety and insomnia. 
.
On admission to the inpatient psychiatric unit, patient 
corroborates the information as above. He reports having 
longstanding depression and anxiety that "comes and goes." 
Recently he reports that "the small things set me off" and that 
"things people say or do that shouldn't be triggering are 
triggering." He reports feeling anxious and concerned that no 
one wants to be around him. He reports frequent episodes of 
"exploding" where he cuts, bangs his head, and punches himself. 
He experiences relief and feels "good in the moment" while he is 
self harming, but subsequently feels more depressed and guilty. 
He reports a history of egodystonic suicidal ideation but denies 
current SI, intent or plan. 
.
Mr. ___ reports a period of four nights last semester when 
he stayed up all night and was very focused on assignments and 
"running around the city." He endorsed racing thoughts and 
denied pressured speech. No one told him that he was not acting 
like himself at this time. He also denies risky behavior 
including hypersexuality, unsafe sex, increased spending, and 
legal troubles. 
.
Mr. ___ also reports difficulty concentrating and a 
"processing disorder" since childhood. When using stimulants 
recreationally, he reports feeling "normal," like he is able to 
process well. 
.
In regards to his self injurious behavior, Mr. ___ notes 
that prior to engaging in self harm, he appears "out of it, not 
present" and "actively paces and appears very anxious." He also

___ if he begins to feel the urge to engage in self harm.

euthymic affect with future oriented thought content verbalized.

contact his therapist, on-call clinician at school, call his
