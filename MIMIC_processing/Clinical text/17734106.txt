Briefly, this is as ___ year old single Caucasian man, currently 
a freshman at ___ with history of ADHD in

intermittent depression beginning in high school, chronic 
suicidal ideation, no prior psychiatric admissions or suicide 
attempts, who initially presented to ___ ED via EMS on a 
___ for suicidal ideation with reported plan after being

. 
ED Course: patient was in good behavioral control and did not 
require physical or chemical restraints. 
. 
On my interview with Mr. ___, who was notably calm, pleasant, 
and cooperative on examination, he initially reported that he 
was doing well, stating he is a freshman at ___, which 
recently merged with ___ and was doing 
well, "I enjoy what I'm doing greatly," noting that he lives 
with his roommates, has friends on campus, and was satisfied 
where his education was.
However, Mr. ___ reported a longstanding history of a "deep 
seeded" depression, which he described as "genetic," that began 
during his freshman year in high school. Reported a history of 
bullying beginning in middle school, stating he had been in 
special education classes for ADHD and because he was interested 
in theater, he was called the "gay retard" during his childhood. 
Reported high school was somewhat better, as he began working 
out and had a few more close friends. However, stated he 
continued to be depressed during this time, particularly during 
his senior year following an event where he was "blackmailed by 
my friends" in making a movie that was humiliating and 
embarrassing to him. 
. 
Mr. ___ reported intermittent depression that lasts a few days 
at a time that tends to be reactive. Reported that when he is 
feeling depressed he experiences it as an "absence of presence-- 
I notice less, I zone out more and get more in my head." 
Reported anxiety particularly on how he is perceived, "I care a 
lot about relationships an I worry incessantly about social 
media." Reported that his depression tends to lift after a few 
days when he has a good interaction with a friend or has a good 
performance. He also reported chronic intermittent suicidal 
ideation, stating that his SI intensified during his senior year
of high school after the incident with his friends when they 
made the embarrassing video-- he stated that following this, his 
"friends" made a sequel to the video in which he dies. Reported 
he has been experiencing more intense SI with thoughts of 
hanging himself and stated he has rehearsed this; on my 
examination he reported he used a belt to wrap around his neck 
to "see how it felt." Denied other rehearsals on my examination. 

. 
Patient denied recent psychosocial stressors, stating that he 
did break up with his girlfriend in ___ on the day after 
his birthday, but stated that this was "fine." Reported school 
is going well and that he has supportive friends. ___ 
difficulty with sleep, stating he sleeps about ___ hours per 
night. Reported energy was a "little down," and notes that he 
recently hurt his shoulder working out about 3 months ago, 
stating this has stressed him out a bit as exercise was a coping 
skill. Denied difficulty with concentration and denied current 
suicidal ideation. Reported appetite was intact, although 
slightly decreased as he was not exercising as much. 
. 
On the day of presentation, patient reported he had been feeling 
depressed and went into the shower because that is how he copes. 
Reported he had texted his father that he was thinking of 
killing himself, noting he was "mildly intoxicated." Reported he 
had talked with his father and had planned on going to bed 
following their conversation, and when the patient opened the 
bathroom
door, EMS was there to bring him to the hospital. Denies he was 
going to kill himself at the time. 
. 
On psychiatric review of systems, patient denied history of 
manic symptoms including decreased need for sleep, increased 
impulsivity, grandiosity. Denied history of psychosis including 
AVH, paranoia, TIB. Denied history of panic attacks. Denied 
eating disordered behavior including restricting, binging and
purging. Denied drug use and stated that although he drank "a 
little" prior to admission, denied regular use, stating, 
"alcohol isn't the reason I'm here." 
. 
With the patient's permission, I contacted his mother, ___ 
___ ___ and reviewed the history and presentation, 
who stated that she felt that discharge home tomorrow with 
return to school and increased outpatient supports was 
reasonable. She understood that there was some risk for suicide 
following discharge, but that at this time a discharge home with 
return to school, which he found helpful, was reasonable.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is as ___ year old single Caucasian man, currently a 
freshman at ___ with history of ADHD in the 
past, not on stimulants, longstanding history of
intermittent depression beginning in high school, chronic 
suicidal ideation, no prior psychiatric admissions or suicide 
attempts, who initially presented to ___ ED via EMS on a 
___ for suicidal ideation with reported plan after being
found locked in a bathroom. 
. 
Review of OMR and interview with patient notable for 
longstanding history of intermittent depression with chronic 
intermittent suicidal ideation and history of suicidal gestures 
with inconsistent reports (reported to Dr. ___ in ED that hew 
as
attempting to hang himself to give himself the positive 
sensation of tingling and reported to Dr. ___ he 
attempted to cut his wrists in the past), but with patient 
reporting to me that he only recently rehearsed attempting hang 
himself about 4 weeks ago. Reported depressive feelings in the 
ED, stating, "the pot is
just boiling over" because of SI with thoughts of strangling 
himself with a belt.  
. 
On my examination, patient reported he has been intermittently 
depressed, but stated he was unsure why he was increasingly 
depressed at this time. Reported feeling anxious about social 
relationships, with depression characterized as "absence of
presence," patient denies SI on my examination. Mental status 
examination notable for well groomed man who is calm, 
cooperative on examination, good eye contact, with euthymic 
affect and thought process that is notably linear, goal and 
future oriented.
. 
Diagnostically, differential does include MDD, although patient 
does not appear dysphoric or dysthymic on my examination as 
adjustment disorder, decompensated personality disorder, 
adjustment disorder. Nothing in his history to suggest a prior
manic episode that would be consistent with bipolar disorder. 
Alcohol is likely playing a role in his presentation, although 
the patient denies this is an issue. Of note, nothing in his 
history to suggest a history of psychosis and he is certainly 
not psychotic on my examination.  
. 
#. Legal/Safety: patient admitted to ___ on a ___, upon admission, patient declined to sign a CV. Patient 
maintained excellent behavioral control during his 
hospitalization and did not require physical or chemical 
restraints. He consistently denied SI or thoughts of self harm 
during his hospitalization. Given his engagement in care with 
thought process that was notably linear, logical, goal and 
future oriented, I did not believe he met criteria to file a 
7&8b and he was discharged one day prior to expiration of his 
___. 
. 
#. Unspecified mood disorder with likely diagnosis of GAD: as 
noted above 
- Patient was compliant in his care during his hospitalization 
and participated appropriately in his care. 
- Patient was continued on Zoloft 25 mg po daily with no 
complaints of side effects. Recommend increasing as tolerated as 
an outpatient. In addition, we started Vistaril 25 mg po q6h prn 
and he received one dose during his hospitalization without 
complaints of side effects. 
- Treatment team was in contact with his mother, who agreed with 
assessment and plan to discharge back to school with referral to 
outpatient supports. Mother reported she would assist the 
patient in obtaining a primary care referral and psychiatric 
care when he returns to home later this ___. 
. 
#. Acne: chronic, stable 
- Continued minocycline 100 mg po bid 
. 
#. Shoulder pain: stable 
- Continued ibuprofen 600 mg po q6h prn pain

RISK ASSESSMENT: Patient is at chronically elevated risk for 
suicide with risk factors that include chronic suicidal ideation 
and patient reporting chronic depression with reported 
rehearsal, per the patient, approximately 1 month ago. Other 
risk factors also include male sex, young age, and recent 
alcohol use. However, he also has a number of protective 
factors-- he is intelligent, talented, has a supportive family, 
is engaging with others, and at time of discharge he was also 
notably linear, goal and future oriented with plan to return to 
school and complete his semester.
