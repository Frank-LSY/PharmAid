artery dissection
 
HPI: 
___ is an ___ woman with a history of
diabetes c/b neuropathy presenting with acute onset vertigo and
found to have left vertebral artery dissection with intraluminal
thrombus just proximal to the basilar artery. 

The patient was at home (lives by herself) preparing dinner. At
7:15 pm she suddenly developed vertigo, which she described as a
sensation of dysequilibrium. She sat down because she felt that
she would fall and did not stand up again. She checked a FSBG,
which was 100. She drank some juice with no improvement. She
began progressively more dizzy and nauseated. She vomited twice.
Since she felt too dizzy to walk, she shuffled her chair over to
the telephone and attempted to call ___. She accidentally dialed
411 twice before reaching 911. She was dialing with her right
hand. Thought she could read the numbers, but just felt 
generally
"confused." When she finally reached 911 she could comprehend
what they were saying and could speak without noticing any
dysarthria. She noted that it felt as though her own voice were
coming from far away. She was taken by EMS to ___
where a CTA revealed a left vertebral artery dissection (~C3-C4
level) with 
 
ROS: 
On neurological review of systems, the patient denies headache,
difficulties producing or comprehending speech, loss of vision,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
lightheadedness,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the patient denies recent fever, 
chills, night sweats, or recent weight changes. Denies cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, palpitations. 
Denies diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  Denies 
dysuria,

Ms. ___ developed the acute onset of vertigo prior to
presentation. She developed nausea and vomitting. She called 
911.

Final Report
EXAMINATION:  MRI AND MRA BRAIN AND MRA NECK PT11 MR HEAD NECK.
 
INDICATION:  History: ___ with left vertebral dissection.  // 
eval for stroke
and fat suppression to evaluate dissection.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Three dimensional time of flight MR arteriography 
was performed
through the brain with maximum intensity projection 
reconstructions.
 
2D time of flight MR angiography of the neck was performed.
 
Brain imaging was performed with sagittal T1 and axial FLAIR, 
T2, gradient
echo and diffusion technique.
 
Three dimensional maximum intensity projection and segmented 
images were
generated. This report is based on interpretation of all of 
these images. The
examination was performed using a 1.5T MRI.
 
COMPARISON:  Reference CTA head and neck dated ___.
 
FINDINGS: 
 
MRI Brain:
Motion artifact on the diffusion-weighted images limits 
evaluation of the
posterior fossa.  Within this limitation, there is no evidence 
of hemorrhage,
edema, masses, mass effect, midline shift or infarction.  
Periventricular and
subcortical T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities are noted which may 
represent small
vessel ischemic changes.  Areas of encephalomalacia in the right 
thalamus and
right cerebellar hemisphere consistent with chronic lacunar 
infarcts. 
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci are suggestive of 
involutional changes.
 
There is mucosal thickening of the anterior ethmoid air cells.  
Bilateral
ocular lens implants are noted.
 
MRA brain: There is decreased signal within the left V3 and V4 
vertebral
artery segments, similar to that seen on CTA.  The intracranial 
vessels are
otherwise patent.  No aneurysms identified.  Incidental note is 
made of
bilateral fetal type posterior cerebral arteries.
 
MRA neck: The origins of the common carotid and vertebral 
arteries are not
imaged.  The imaged portions of the common and internal carotid 
arteries are
patent, with mild irregularity at the carotid bifurcations, 
consistent with
calcified and noncalcified plaque better visualized on CTA.  The 
right
vertebral artery is patent and maintains a constant caliber 
throughout its
course.  There is diminished signal throughout the left 
vertebral artery,
along with irregularity of the arterial wall.  Irregularity and 
multifocal
stenosis of the left vertebral artery is better appreciated on 
CTA.  No
intramural hematoma is demonstrated on the fat suppressed images 
of the neck.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Motion artifact on the diffusion weighted images limit 
evaluation of the
posterior fossa.  Within this limitation, there is no acute 
infarction.
2. With the exception of near occlusion of the left V4 segment 
described
above, the intracranial vasculature is patent.
3. Diffuse irregularity/multifocal stenoses of the left 
vertebral artery with near occlusion in the V3/V4 segment are 
redemonstrated, and overall more completely assessed on CTA.  
Fat suppression images through the neck do not demonstrate 
evidence of vertebral artery dissection.  Consequently, the 
etiology of multifocal stenosis/near occlusion of the left 
vertebral artery is most likely related to atherosclerotic 
disease.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with PMH of diabetes, 
hypertension, arthritis, and fluid retention, who is admitted to 
the Neurology stroke service with symptoms of transient 
ascending symptoms of acute onset vertigo followed by difficulty 
dialing the correct button on phone, followed by difficulty with 
speech. These symptoms were secondary to transient ischemic 
attack in the setting of a Left Vertebral Artery Dissection with 
floating thrombus. Workup included an evaluation with CTA which 
showed the dissection; MRI which did not show acute ischemic 
stroke but limited due to motion degradation in area of primary 
interest. Patient was evaluated by neurosurgery, and there was 
no acute intervention needed. Patient was initially managed with 
a heparin drip, and transitioned over to apixaban 5 mg twice a 
day. Patient was evaluated by physical therapy and social work 
and she was determined to be a discharge home. She had no 
deficits at time of discharge, she has chronic hearing 
impairment, and did not have dentures. She is being discharged 
on apixaban 5 mg twice a day, to be continued for 3 to 6 months, 
and length is to be determined at the time of neurology stroke 
___. Patient will have an interval CTA in 3 months to 
guide length of treatment.

Her stroke risk factors include the following:

1) DM: A1c pending at time of discharge.
2) LDL pending at time of discharge.
3) Obesity
4) left vertebral artery dissection with free-floating thrombus.

Transitional Issues:
- CTA in 3 months to determine stability of dissection.
- ___ with stroke neurology in 3 months to determine 
length of apixaban use.
-Primary care provider to ___ on hemoglobin A1c, LDL, and 
other comorbidities and to determine if she would benefit from 
being started on a statin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of sudden onset dizziness, 
difficulty with dialing numbers, and difficulty with speech, 
resulting from a transient ischemic attack (TIA) secondary to a 
left vertebral dissection.  A TIA is commonly known as a warning 
stroke.  A stroke is a condition where a blood vessel providing 
oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The 
brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the 
other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being 
deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of 
symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
Left vertebral artery dissection with thrombus,
Diabetes,
Hypertension,
Age

We are changing your medications as follows:
Start Taking Apixaban 5mg twice a day.  

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:

- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
