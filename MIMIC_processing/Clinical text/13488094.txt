IMAGING:
==========
# Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ 
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). There 
is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 
The gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is mild systolic 
anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: small cavity hyperdynamic left ventricle with mild 
resting left ventricular tract outflow obstruction that 
increases during Valsalva maneuver  

# CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE Study Date of ___  
Impression: Right ICA with <40% stenosis. 
            Left ICA with 40-59% stenosis. 

# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION:  
Stable appearance since yesterday of small left temporal 
subdural hematoma. 

# EEG Study Date of ___ 
IMPRESSION: This is a normal continuous monitoring study. There 
are no focal features or electrographic seizures. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with PMH HTN, HL, and UC who presented ___ after a 
syncopal episode c/b subdural hematoma, initially on the 
neurosurgery service, transferred to medicine for syncopal 
evaluation.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============
#. Syncope: The patient has a h/o vasovagal syncope, however 
this particular episode was not preceded by her normal aura and 
the extent of her injuries raises concern for cardiac etiology. 
Pt was monitored on telemetry, with no arrhythmia noted. She 
underwent TTE which showed mild outflow tract obstruction, 
though this was thought to be unlikely as the causative factor 
as pt was not undergoing any Valsalva maneuvers at the time of 
syncope. However, given this finding, cardiology was consulted 
and felt that there was no indication for beta blocker, 
especially as pt has not tolerated beta blocker in the past due 
to bradycardia. Rather, it is crucial for pt to stay hydrated. 
They recommended discontinuing her HCTZ-triameterene combination 
and instead increasing her lisinopril for better blood pressure 
control. She was also discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor 
for further evaluation. 
 
# subdural hematoma: Pt presented with small subdural hematoma, 
for which she was initially on the neurosurgery service. Repeat 
imaging showed this finding to be stable. Per neurosurgery, she 
was restarted on her aspirin prior to discharge. She will follow 
up with neurosurgery in 4 weeks with repeat imaging at that 
time. 

# superficial facial lacerations: Pt sustained several 
lacerations to her face, requiring sutures to her lip and 
eyebrow. These sutures should be removed ___ days after 
placement, to be done at her PCP ___.

# nasal fracture: Per imaging at OSH, pt has a non-displaced 
nasal fracture. She can follow up as needed with plastic surgery 
as an outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
# HTN: Per cardiology recommendations and importance of staying 
hydrated, pt was taken off her HCTZ-triameterene combination and 
her lisinopril was increased from 10 to 20 mg daily.
 
# hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine  

# HLD: continued simvastatin  

# hair loss: continued finasteride  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
Pt will need repeat head imaging in 4 weeks.

Sutures should be removed between ___.

Pt should have creatinine and potassium checked as an outpatient 
given increased dose of lisinopril.

___ of Hearts monitor will be followed by PCP and cardiologist.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted after a fainting event, and 
were found to have a small head bleed as well as a nasal 
fracture. You were initially on the surgery service, and your 
bleed appeared stable. You were transferred to the medicine 
service and were evaluated by cardiology. They recommended 
making several changes to your medications, including stopping 
triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide and increasing your lisinopril. 
It is important that you stay hydrated and this will be most 
important for preventing further fainting episodes. We are 
discharging you with a heart monitor as well. Please follow up 
with your primary care doctor, to have sutures removed in ___ 
days. You will also need follow up with the neurosurgeons in 4 
weeks.

Nonsurgical Brain Hemorrhage
Â•Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, 
or excessive bending.
Â•Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Advil, or Ibuprofen 
etc.
