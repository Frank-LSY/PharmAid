Brief Hospital Course:
P- ___ w acute uncomplicated appendicitis
A- underwent laparoscopic appendectomy
C- NA
T- procedure complicated by uvula tear, achieved hemostasis and 
evaluated by ENT without further intervention

Mr. ___ was admitted and underwent laparoscopic 
appendectomy, which was complicated by traumatic intubation 
resulting in uvula tear requiring intraoperative ENT 
consultation. With packing, hemostasis was achieved without 
further intervention necessary. He was then extubated without 
complications and continued his recovery in the recovery unit. 

The appendectomy was complicated by contamination due to bag 
violation during removal of specimen. Thus he was continued on 
antibiotics and will complete a 4-day course. 

At time of discharge he was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating, voiding without difficulty. He understood discharge 
instructions and will follow up in clinic postoperatively.

throat during surgery.

YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks.

medicines without a prescription.
