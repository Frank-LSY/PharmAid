History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo ___ woman who moved from ___ ___ years

(likely ITP), chronic gastritis and duodenitis, referred from 
the ___ clinic for platelets of 8 in the absence of any

with the translation.

Patient has a long standing history of thrombocytopenia which 
she has been followed for in ___. She states that they have 
been low for approximately ___ years, perhaps longer. PLT Ab was 
positive, so etiology is presumed ITP. Platelet count started at 
70-80 and has gradually declined over time. On routine exam last 
week, platelets were found to be 30 so daughter contacted the 
hem/onc physician. Repeated CBC on the day of admission was 
notable for platelets of 8. At this time, patient reported 
feeling very well with the exception of mild URI symptoms. She

had for several years and underwent lap-chole on ___. 
Patient has a PLT 30 last week during GI evaluation for 
cholecystectomy. She had slight improvement in platelets with 
decadron pulse prior to CCY earlier this year, with no bleeding 
issues. Intra-operatively, the patient was found to have 
macronodular cirrhosis of the liver involving both right and 
left lobes s/p liver biopsy. She underwent evaluation for 
cirrhosis and elevated LFTs, and was found to have a 
+anti-mitochrondrial Ab consistent with PBC. Hep B and C testing 
has been negative.   

Otherwise, patient has had chronic gastritis and ulcers, which

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo ___ woman who moved from ___ ___ years ago, with 
history of thrombocytopenia for almost ___ years (likely ITP), 
chronic gastritis and duodenitis, referred from the ___ 
clinic for platelets of 8 in the absence of any signs of 
bleeding. Patient is ___ speaking, history was obtained in 
the presence of the daughter (___) and a ___ 
___, who helped with the history and physical. 

# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: The patient had repeat platelets on 
admission with a count of 13 and was not transfused. She was 
initiated on a four day burst of high dose dexamethasone 40mg PO 
daily. She will be traveling to ___ soon and did not want to 
deal with a long taper. She will need repeat labs at her 
oncology appointment on ___ in addition to follow up 
with oncology while in ___. Multiple infectious labs were sent 
to broaden the differential for her thrombocytopenia including 
HIV, HEP B, and H.Pylori (HEP C was negative at At___ PCP).

#Gastritis/duodenitis: She is planned to undergo EGD as 
outpatient. We continued home sucralfate and started her on 
pantoprazole 40 mg BID while on high dose steroids. H. pylori 
testing was still pending on discharge.

#Transaminitis: Unclear etiology. During prior admission, 
patient was found to have macronodular cirrhosis of the liver 
involving both right and left lobes s/p liver biopsy showing 
findings suggestive of toxic/metabolic injury, with advanced 
fibrosis (see pathology report). She was found to have a 
+anti-mitochrondrial Ab consistent with PBC, which fits in in 
terms of its autoimmune nature along with ITP. Hep C  and Hep B 
testing were negative. This issue is followed-up as an 
outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your stay here 
at ___. You came into the hospital from your ___ clinic 
after they found your platelet count to be dangerously low. You 
were having no symptoms and no dangerous side affects from your 
low platelet count. Platelets help your body prevent and stop 
bleeding. On arrival to the hospital, repeat blood work 
confirmed low platelets.

The most likely cause of your low platelets is ITP (idiopathic 
thrombocytopenia purpura). You were started on a very high dose 
of steroids called dexamethasone. You will receive a 4 day 
"burst" of this medication. You will need to have your platelet 
counts followed up by your outpatient oncologist, and likely by 
a physician in ___ during your trip. 

You also had multiple test for other infections that could have 
triggered your ITP. Many of these tests were not complete when 
you left the hospital, however will be followed up by your 
oncologist.
