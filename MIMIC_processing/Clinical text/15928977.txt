indicating that her mood had improved and focused on wanting to 
get better and get her work done. During interviews with the

and borderline personality scales. She noted some chronic 
passive suicidal ideation, though denied any on the day of

suicidal thoughts.  She was interactive, bright and motivated on 
the unit.  ___ agreed to aftercare and also understood the

and possible side effects and risks of this medication, and 
risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not

well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any questions about medications 
with the treatment team, and I answered the patient's questions. 
 The patient appeared able to understand and consented to begin 
the medication.  

RISK ASSESSMENT:

Low imminent risk of harm/violence to self/others.

1) Chronic/Static Risk Factors:
Chronic and severe mental illness, prior suicide attempts, 
organic CNS damage, male sex, history of trauma/abuse, family 
history of suicide, chronic medical illness, 
impulsive/aggressive tendencies

2) Modifiable Risk Factors:
-Acute major mood episode- Modified by medication adjustments
-Hopelessness - Modified by encouraging social supports such as 
friends
-Recent school/social stressors - Modified by encouraging 
development of improved coping skills 
-Supports - Modified by identifying outpatient treatment 
providers for the patient to see in follow-up 
-Chronic suicidal ideation - Modified by encouraging development 
of better coping skills

3) Protective Factors:
Protective factors include current outpatient 
providers/treatment, strong connections to family and community 
support, and skills in problem solving, conflict resolution and 
handling problems in a non-violent way. Current risk is 
low/moderate for intentional self-harm given that patient denies 
suicidal ideation, intent and plan, is accepting of treatment, 
is currently sober and is future oriented with plans 

PROGNOSIS:
Good due to the fact that patient is help-seeking, and has been 
looking for on-campus counseling. She is future oriented and 
motivated to get better so will be likely to continue with 
proper follow-up.
