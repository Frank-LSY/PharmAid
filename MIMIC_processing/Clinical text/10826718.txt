CTA torso ___
"No evidence of aortic dissection.  There is no abdominal aortic 
aneurysm.  There is mild calcium burden in the abdominal aorta 
and great abdominal arteries.  There is complete occlusion of 
the right common iliac artery with distal reconstitution in the 
distal common iliac artery before its bifurcation. 
  
1. Occlusion of the right common iliac artery with distal 
reconstitution. 
2. No evidence of aortic dissection."

MRI Brain w/o contrast ___
"  1. No evidence for an acute infarction or other acute 
intracranial 
abnormalities. 
2. Small focus of encephalomalacia and chronic blood products 
centered in the right globus pallidus, likely sequela of a prior 
hemorrhage. 
3. Supratentorial white matter T2 signal abnormalities are 
nonspecific but 
likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in this 
age group. 
4. Paranasal sinus disease. "

TTE ___
"The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Mild mitral regurgitation.  "
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ gentleman, past medical history of prior basal 
ganglia stroke,
presented with sudden onset back pain and lower extremity 
weakness.  Neurologic exam is improving since admission.  His 
history of sudden onset weakness and neurologic exam is 
consistent with anterior spinal artery stroke syndrome at T7. He 
had bilateral lower extremity weakness and a sensory level at T7 
on admission.  MRI from OSH was notable for T2 hyperintensities 
at the T10 level; DWI sequences were not obtained on OSH MRI. 
Spinal cord infarct could be due to hypotension via artery of 
___, aortic dissection, or embolus. CTA Torso did not 
show any evidence of dissection, but there was a likely chronic 
occlusion of right common iliac artery prior to bifurcation. 
Overall the etiology was felt to be either hypotension, as it is 
in a watershed region, but embolic is still on the differential. 
A repeat MRI of the T spine was performed, which showed 
resolving T2 hyperintensity at the T10 level, this further 
support acute ischemic infarct as the etiology of his weakness 
(final report pending). It had already greatly improving on the 
day of discharge, he was able to walk with a walker. 

Transitional issues

#spinal cord infarct - the MRI read of the repeat MRI T spine, 
which includes DWI sequences was still pending at the time of 
discharge. This should be followed up on to confirm the 
diagnosis of infarct. Overall the history and exam was very 
convincing for acute infarct. Aspirin 81 mg was started. His A1c 
was 5.7%, TSH 2.7, LDL 55. He was already on simvastatin 40 mg 
daily and blood pressure medications. TTE was basically normal, 
no ASD, normal left atrial size, with less concern for 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 

#UTI: Positive UA, >182 WBC, urine culture did not grow 
anything. Received 2 doses of 1 gm ceftriaxone. He should 
continue 5 more days of cefpodoxime 100 mg BID to complete a 7 
day course of UTI.

#urinary retention - he had some urinary retention and his foley 
was removed on day of discharge ___ for a voiding trial, this 
may need to be replaced if he is not urinating appropriately

#R common iliac artery occlusion with distal reconstituion - 
this was noted incidentally on CTA, there is reconstitution in 
the distal R common iliac, so this is likely chronic. he was not 
reporting any symptoms of claudication and had good pulses, can 
consider vascular surgery follow up as an outpatient if he 
begins to have symptoms or otherwise as necessary

Chronic issues
Home antihypertensives held to allow for permissive 
hypertension, these can be restarted at rehab for goal 
normotension.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of weakness and numbness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE of your spinal cord, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the spinal cord is decreased, either from low blood flow or from 
a clot. The spinal cord is the part of your body that controls 
and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the 
spinal cord from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are high blood pressure, cholesterol 

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 start aspirin 81 mg daily, which you should continue 
indefinitely  
 start cefpodoxime 100 mg twice daily for 5 days to treat your 
urinaty tract infection

 
 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
