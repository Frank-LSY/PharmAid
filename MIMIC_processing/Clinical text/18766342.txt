History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ right-handed woman with a history 
of ITP, stage 3 CKD, epilepsy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia 
who presented with 1 week of lower back and anterior thigh pain, 
and numbness and tightness spreading from left back across the 
abdomen to the right side.

She has a history of intermittent low back pain on either side, 
precipitated by particular activities or sitting/lying down for 
too long. However ~1 week ago developed an atypical bilateral 
lower back aching pain which spread to bilateral anterolateral 
thighs. There was no shock-like radiating pain to the thighs. 
Rather, it was the same pain in her back that spread to include 
her thighs (she circumscribes the area corresponding to the L2 
dermatome). Last ___, she developed numbness in her 
left back extending from just below her shoulder blade to her 
hip. The next day, it extended around the front to about 
midline. By ___, the numbness had spread across 
midline on the front to the right abdomen and flank. On 
___, the area on her right thigh which had been painful 
started to feel similarly numb, and yesterday her left thigh 
became numb as well. 

She had seen her PCP who ordered basic labs which were normal, 
and also got an appointment with a neurologist for ___. 
However, she presents to the ED because of an increasingly 
uncomfortable band like tightness that has developed in these 
areas of her back and abdomen, which is concentrated on the left 
back, flank, and front, but also extends slightly past midline 
to the right abdomen. 

She has had no recent headaches, visual blurring/diplopia, 
fevers, rashes, big bites, weight loss/weight gain. Also, no 
weakness, gait difficulties, changes in urinary or bowel habits. 


She has a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura for 
which she was last treated with rituximab in ___. Her platelet 
counts have been stable. She also has a generalized epilepsy for 
which he takes carbamazepine (brand name only) 400 mg BID.  She 
was diagnosed at the age of ___, and has only had 2 seizures her 
entire life.
