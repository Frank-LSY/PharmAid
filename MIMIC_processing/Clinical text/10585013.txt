Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a small bowel obstruction. 
You were given bowel rest and intravenous fluids and a 
nasogastric tube was placed in your stomach to decompress your 
bowels. Your obstruction has subsequently resolved after 
conservative management. You have tolerated a regular diet, are 
passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by 
mouth. You may return home to finish your recovery.
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel
movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable, however it 
is important that you have a bowel movement in the next ___ 
days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patientÂ’s to have 
some decrease in bowel function but you should not have 
prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small 
amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if 
you notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel 
movements or having loose stool without improvement please call 
the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are 
severe. If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a 
risk that you will have some constipation. Please take an over 
the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms 
do not improve call the office. If you have any of the following 
symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the 
emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, 
increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to 
tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or extended 
constipation.

is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual
