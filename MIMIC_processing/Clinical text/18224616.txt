borderline needing pressors. Had a headache that improved after 
Tylenol. Overall feels fairly well despite hypotension. There 
was concern for sepsis. Concern for abdominal etiology given 
___. Urine, CXR, flu neg. CBC with WBC 16.8, otherwise wnl. 
Chems unremarkable. Lactate 1.5->0.9. CT A/P did not show 
anything of concern in the abdomen but did show ?LLL aspiration

Requested ICU admission for continued BP monitoring (was as low 
as ___ in the ED at one point). Had trace pericardial 
effusion on bedside echo, but otherwise good cardiac fx, 
negative FAST, full IVC with mild respiratory variability. BP 
came back up without intervention, so held off on pressors in 
the ER.

___ CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.  No evidence of extraluminal contrast 
extravasation within the lower chest or abdomen to suggest bowel

recent upper endoscopy, findings likely represent aspiration 
versus infection.
