azithromycin, levofloxacin, and 2 five-day pulses of steroid), 
bronchiectasis (on last CT ___ w/ persistent cough and SOB 
who presented overnight with 2 episodes of 500 cc coffee ground 
hematemesis. She was placed on octreotide, IV PPI and underwent 
endoscopy that showed GEJ erosions and multiple gastric ulcers 
that were not actively bleeding. She had no further episodes of 
emesis post procedure. We recommended staying for hemodynamic 
monitoring overnight with CBC check but she decided to leave 
AMA.

# Hematemesis: Pt presented with a suspected upper GIB with 2 
episodes of coffee ground emesis, concerning for variceal bleed 
given the patient's history of hemochromatosis. Patient was 
tachycardic at ___, given 2u pRBCs, and subsequently 
transferred to ___ on octreotide gtt and protonix, which were 
continued upon admission to the MICU. Upon arrival to ___, 
patient was mildly tachycardic to HR 110, which responded to IV 
fluid boluses, otherwise patient was hemodynamically stable. RUQ 
ultrasound was significant for only mild hepatic steatosis. She 
underwent endoscopy that showed GEJ erosions and multiple 
gastric ulcers that were not actively bleeding.

# Hemochromatosis: Heterozygous HFE ___, recently diagnosed 
___. She receives therapeutic phlebotomy q3months. LFTs 
unremarkable despite Alb 3.3, INR 1.0. Right upper quadrant 
ultrasound showed mild steatosis. CXR without evidence of 
cardiomegaly.

# Cough/SOB: Patient reported significant cough and dysnea for 
the past 2 months. She is s/p two courses of steroids and 
antibiotics (azithromycin and levofloxacin) in ___. Patient 
had CT on ___ that was significant for a left ninth rib 
fracture and bronchiectasis, which could both be contributing to 
the patient's symptoms. Her respiratory status was monitored 
during the admission. She was intermittently treated with duoneb 
nebulizer treatments and was never hypoxic.
 
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets were 110 on 
admission, likely from a consumptive process from her GI 
bleeding. There was no evidence of splenomegaly on abdominal 
ultrasound.

# Anxiety:  Patient was treated with her home dose of Xanax 0.5 
mg daily.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:***
- Will need repeat endoscopy in ___ weeks for resolution of her 
gastric ulcers.
- Should continue pantoprazole 40mg BID until resolution of 
ulcers.
- Should undergo H. Pylori testing (Left AMA before obtaining 
stool sample)
- Should establish care with hepatologist given hepatic 
steatosis seen on liver US and known hemochromatosis.
