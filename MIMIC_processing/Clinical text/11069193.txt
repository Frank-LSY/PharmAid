Cath Report ___:
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel and is normal. This vessel bifurcates into the 
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 70% hazy stenosis in 
the mid segment immediately distal to orogin of D1. The 
Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium caliber 
vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel. The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the 
proximal segment, is a large caliber vessel. The ___ Obtuse 
Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a small caliber 
vessel. There is a 50% stenosis in the proximal segment.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is a 20% stenosis in the proximal 
segment. The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the 
distal segment, is a medium caliber vessel. The Right 
Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
Intervention:
OCT showed high-grade stenosis in mid LAD (MLA 1.9 mm2) and also 
a focal area of dissection in the proximal part of the lesion.
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) was performed on an ad hoc basis based on the 
coronary angiographic findings from the diagnostic portion of 
this procedure. A 6 ___ EBU3.5 guide advanced from femoral 
artery provided adequate support. Stenosis predilated with a 2.5 
mm balloon and then deployed a 3.0 mm x 20 mm Promus Elite DES. 
Postdilated with a 3.25 mm NC balloon. Final angiography 
revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis. 
Repeat ___ performed showed excellent stent expansion and wall 
apposition.
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.
Findings
 Two vessel coronary artery disease.
 Successful PCI with drug-eluting stent of the LAD coronary 
artery.
Recommendations
 ASA 81mg per day indefinitely.
 Plavix 75mg/day for minimum 12 months
 Secondary prevention of CAD and further management as per 
primary cardiology team.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ admitted with chest pressure concerning 
for unstable angina on ___. She underwent coronary angiogram 
___ which showed high grade stenosis (70%) in LAD, 50% proximal 
OM2, 20% proximal RCA. 

 # Coronary artery disease s/p PCI of LAD with DES x1. Troponins 
negative. Post-operatively, she became nauseous and vomited 
blood-tinged emesis x1. V-Scan was negative for tamponade. Her 
access sites remained stable. During this time she had pauses on 
tele up to 5 seconds, BP stable, likely vasovagal. H/H and labs 
remained stable. Symptoms improved overnight and she denied any 
further nausea, vomiting after gradual advancement of diet. GI 
was consulted and recommended PPI daily, consider EGD as 
outpatient pending cardiac recovery in future for GERD. 
 - Continue Asa
 - Start Plavix
 - Stop Pravastatin, start Atorvastatin
 - Hold Atenolol due to pauses. Consider restarting as 
outpatient as HR/BP allows. 

 # Hypertension: Clinically stable
 - Continue Amlodipine 
 - Atenolol on hold due to pauses as above

 # Hyperlipidemia: FLP unknown
 - Stop Pravastatin, start high dose Atorvastatin

 # Anxiety: Pt declines medication for anxiety while in hospital

 # DISPO: Home today without services. Follow up with Dr. 
___ in 2 weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

 It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___! 

 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? 
 ========================== 
 You were evaluated for chest pain (angina).

 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL? 
 ============================== 
 You had a coronary angiogram which showed a blockage in your 
left anterior descending (LAD) artery. A drug coated stent was 
placed to reopen the blockage to restore or improve blood flow 
to the heart.

 After your procedure you felt nauseous and vomited. You had a 
scan of your heart that did not show any evidence of bleeding in 
your heart. Your wrist and groin access sites were stable. At 
this time your heart rate was slow. This was a vasovagal 
reaction (or nerve trigger) to your nausea and vomiting. We 
stopped your atenolol because it can further slow your heart 
rate. 

 Because there was a small amount of blood when you vomited, the 
gastroenterology (GI) doctors saw ___. They recommended starting 
a medication called Pantoprazole for GERD. They recommend 
considering an EGD in the future once you are recovered from a 
cardiac perspective. We watched your blood counts which were 
stable, and your symptoms improved. 

 Instructions regarding care of the right wrist and right groin 
access site are included with your discharge information.  

 Please continue your current medications with the following 
changes:  
- Start Aspirin 81mg daily, lifelong.  
- Start Plavix 75mg daily, you should take this for a minimum of 
one year and ONLY stop when told by a cardiologist specifically. 
 
- Stop Pravastatin and start Atorvastatin 80mg daily. This 
medication is more effective at lowering cholesterol. 
- Start Pantoprazole 20mg daily. This is recommended by the GI 
doctors to help with your GERD. 
- Hold Atenolol for now because you had a slower heart rate 
after the procedure. When you follow up with Dr. ___ if 
it is ok for you to resume this medication.
 
 It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, Aspirin and Clopidogrel (Plavix) 
keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce 
your risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, a blood clot could form in your 
heart stent which could cause a life threatening heart attack. 
Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to 
your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the 
medications. 
 
 It is strongly recommended that you attend a cardiac rehab 
program in the near future. A referral form was provided to you 
that lists the locations of these programs. Please bring this 
with you to your follow up visit with your cardiologist, and 
they will inform you when it is safe to begin a program.  

 If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your hospitalization or are experiencing any 
symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need 
to return to the hospital, please call ___ 
Cardiology at ___ or your primary care doctor's office. 
 

 It has been a pleasure to have participated in your care and we 
wish you the best with your health.
