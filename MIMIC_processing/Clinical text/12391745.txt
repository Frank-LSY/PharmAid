-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to 
possibly experience some urgency and frequency over the next 
month; this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or, 
if applicable to you, the indwelling ureteral stent. You may 
also experience some pain associated with spasm of your ureter.

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing.

is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed.

your urinethis, as noted above, is expected and will gradually 
improvecontinue to drink plenty of fluids to flush out your

-You should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any 
medication changes and your post-operative course with your 
primary care doctor.

taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your
