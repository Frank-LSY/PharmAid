status on admission and remained on that level of observation

disorder, and fluoxetine 40mg qD was restarted, as the patient

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
active suicidal ideation.  Their static factors noted at that 
time include  a history of a suicide attempt as a senior in high 
school in ___, history of recurrent major depression, history 
of ethanol abuse, Caucasian race, LGBT identity. The modifiable 
risk factors of ethanol use and intermittent social supports 
were also addressed at that time as the patient was counseled on 
EtOH avoidance, expressing understanding and agreement, advised 
to consider attending AA support groups, and encouraged to 
develop further her friendship circles of supportive friends 
that are accepting of her LGBTQ identity.  Finally, the patient 
is being discharged with many protective risk factors, family 
involvement, education, strong insight and developed coping 
skills, help seeking, therapeutic alliance, existing psychiatric 
and psychotherapeutic treaters, support from school.  Overall, 
Based on the totality of our assessment at this time, the 
patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is optimistic; patient shows 
self-awareness and developed coping skills; likely to do well on 
SSRI with compliance and off EtOH.

MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
**suicidal ideation with/intent/plan, , medication 
noncompliance, social withdrawal, limited social supports, 
limited coping skills, poor reality testing, no established  
insomnia,  active substance abuse/intoxication, recent academic 
difficulty. 

PROTECTIVE RISK FACTORS
 ***help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, sense of 
responsibility to family, life satisfaction, reality testing 
ability, good coping skills, good problem-solving skills, 
positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, 
lack of suicidal ideation at time of discharge, no history of 
substance use disorder, no history of abuse, ability to tolerate 
rejection, and strong social supports.  Thus, I feel the patient 
does not meet section 12a criteria for risk of harm to 
self/others and is safe for discharge with planned supports and 
follow-up.
