HPI: 

Mr. ___ is a ___ R handed man with a past
medical history significant for ___ Disease and
hereditary hemorrhagic telegenctasias with recurrent nose bleeds
(at times requiring transfusions etc.), as well as chronic neck
pain for which he sees a chirop___. He presents as a transfer
from ___ after ___ infarct seen on imaging after he
developed two days of headache/neck pain and gait instability. 

Briefly, the patient states he has had a very stressful week. He
works as a ___ of a small ___-up in ___. On ___ he had a very prolonged and stressful board meeting.
Afterwards he went out for one drink with a friend. When he
returned home he felt "exhausted and spent" so he asked his wife
if they could postpone plans to go out. He then napped for 2.5
hours. When he woke up he felt the gradual onset of a headache
starting at the top of his head and radiating down the sides. He
also had L sided neck pain, but he states that he always has 
left
sided neck pain and tightness since his mid ___. He sees a
chiropractor every single ___ and she performs neck
movements including fast extension/flexion and side to side
movements. He last saw her on ___, two days before his
headache began. 

Later on ___ evening the patient noted that the headache was
worse so he went to sleep early. At 3 AM the patient awoke
feeling very thirsty and thought he was dehydrated. He tried to
get out of bed and noted that he was veering off to the L
constantly. He had trouble maintaining his balance. He did not
notice any other symptoms. He then spent the rest of the weekend
in bed sleeping for hours because he thought this was all due to
a virus. 

This morning ___, day of presentation) when he woke up and
did not feel better in regards to his headache/neck pain and
balance, his wife brought him to the ER at ___. At the ER
the patient underwent a CT head which revealed a L cerebellar
hypodensity with some midline shift. He then underwent an MRI
brain without contrast (no vessel imaging done) which confirmed 
a
L cerebellar infarct in the territory of ___. He was
subsequently transferred to ___ for further evaluation where
the history of neck pain was elicited. 

Regarding his prior history, the patient states he has HHT as
does many of his family members including his father and his
sisters. He has never had any neurologic symptoms that he knows
of other than neck pain/occasional headaches. He also has VWD 
and
therefore avoids NSAIDs. His main medical issues have come from
epistaxis. He has frequent nose bleeds requiring ER visits , at
times requiring transfusions due to profound blood loss. He
denies any clotting history, no bleeding from other areas. The
patient otherwise is healthy, no other medical issues.

IMAGING:
========
CTA Head/Neck ___:
1. Acute infarction of the posterior inferior left cerebellar 
hemisphere. 
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic 
transformation. 
3. Occlusion of the proximal left vertebral artery from the 
origin to the mid V2 segment with distal reconstitution to the 
level of C6.  The chronicity of the occlusion is difficult to 
determine.  MRI with fat suppression can be obtained to assess 
for recent thrombosis/dissection, if clinically indicated. 
4. Patent carotid arteries with no evidence of internal carotid 
artery 
stenosis by NASCET criteria. 
5. Patent circle of ___ without evidence of occlusion. 

CT Head without Contrast ___:
1.  Stable subacute left ___ infarct.  Mildly more prominent 
posterior fossa mass effect, no hydrocephalus. 
2.  Paranasal sinus disease, as above. 
  
TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is no evidence for a 
right-to-left shunt with agitated saline at rest and with 
maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a 
normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global left 
ventricular systolic function. Quantitative biplane left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 59 %. There is no resting left 
ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect 
is seen. Diastolic parameters are indeterminate. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid 
annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with mildly dilated 
ascending aorta. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a 
normal descending aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an 
aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal, with mild hypoplasia of the left coronary 
cusp. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic 
valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is physiologic 
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function. Mildly 
dilated ascending aorta. No definite structural cardiac source 
of embolism (e.g.patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect, 
intracardiac thrombus, or vegetation) seen.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with HHT, VWD, and 
chronic neck pain who initially presented to an outside hospital 
with headache, neck pain and gait instability, primarily veering 
off to the left, found to have a large left ___ infarct. 

MRI showed large left medial ___ infarct. Vessel imaging shows 
that the left vertebral artery is occluded proximally in the 
neck (V1 segment) and reconstitutes distally (though there is 
some luminal irregularities in the V4 segment), consistent with 
dissection.

Neurologic exam on admission notable for direction changing 
nystagmus and gait
instability, veering to the left, and truncal ataxia. He 
otherwise was completely awake/alert and had no significant 
deficits. Neurological exam improved significantly over the 
course of his hospitalization and he had no clear deficits at 
the time of discharge. Thus, there was no need for ___ or OT.

Given history of HHT and VWD, patient is at significantly 
increased risk of adverse bleeding events. Will plan on daily 
ASA 81 mg daily. No systemic anticoagulation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Duration of ASA therapy should be clarified at time of follow 
up in neurology clinic

# Patient instructed to monitor for bleeding on aspirin 

# Patient should follow up with outpatient hematologist/primary 
care doctor

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness, neck pain, 
and unsteadiness when walking resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  

 - Recent neck manipulation with chiropractor 
 - High cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows:  

 - Started daily baby aspirin (81 mg daily)
 - Started a cholesterol lowering medication called atorvastatin 
20 mg every evening
 
Please follow up with neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

In the future, to avoid another artery dissection, you should:
 - Avoid chiropractic neck manipulations
 - Avoid lifting heavy weights
 - Avoid sudden, fast movements of the head or neck
 - Avoid straining the neck 

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  

 - Significant bleeding (now that you are on a daily aspirin) 
 - Lightheadedness
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team
