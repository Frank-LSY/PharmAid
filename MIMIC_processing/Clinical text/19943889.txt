Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY: 
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission.  She was also placed on q15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. She did not 
require physical or chemical restraints during this 
hospitalization. 

There was an incident in which a male patient was found by the 
patient sitting on her bed. She immediately alerted staff who 
intervened. The male patient was kept apart from this patient 
and there was no further incident for the remainder of the 
hospitalization.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
 
Upon admission, the patient reported that she took 4 melatonin 
pills without intent to die, but rather to get attention from 
her family. She reported longstanding history of SI since 
childhood, but denied SI in the hospital. She explains that her 
suicidal thoughts occur in the setting of certain triggers, 
which she clearly lists out on admission. Patient is able to 
identify several triggers for her which include her relationship 
with her family, hurtful words her grandmother said to her, her 
feeling that her grandfather does not want her to live at the 
home anymore, and a recent breakup with her boyfriend. ___, 
pt also stopped taking her medications ___ months prior in 
setting of having unpleasant side effects (nausea and sedation). 


We conducted a detailed review of manic symptoms with the 
patient, since she reported a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. She 
denied any periods of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, 
grandiosity, increased talkativeness, increase in ___ 
activity, or excessive involvement in activities with potential
for painful consequences (tattoos, sex, drugs).  She denied 
periods of decreased need for sleep with intact energy. 
Sometimes feels thoughts racing when anxious. She described a 
history of seeing "shadows" and hearing "kids playing" which she
thinks might be related to paranormal behavior, which she states 
her family believes in. She has not seen or heard hallucinations 
since starting psychiatric medications. Collateral from her 
outpatient PCP and psychiatrist confirmed a lack of known manic 
symptoms, although the patient's mother has reported periods of 
intense aggression (physical towards grandmother). Given her 
above lack of manic history, it was felt that the patient does 
not meet criteria for Bipolar Disorder. This was shared with the 
patient, her mother and her outpatient team. 

The patients presentation was concerning for unspecified mood 
disorder, anxiety, cluster B personality traits, and trauma 
history.

The patient was restarted on Lamictal 25 mg for mood stability. 
Lamictal was started at lower dose given that she had been 
noncompliant for at least 1 month prior to admission. Patient 
tolerated this well. Goal is 200 mg, can double dose (25 -> 50 
-> 100 -> 200) every 2 weeks as outpatient if no side effects 
such as ___ symptoms. Can also consider 
restarting sertraline as outpatient.

At time of discharge patient denied SI and was in stable 
condition. She was discharged with appts for partial 
hospitalization program, therapist, psychiatrist, PCP, and 
endocrinology.

staff without ever requiring restraint or seclusion

alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team.  
 
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
 
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon overdose with 
sleeping pills. Her static factors noted at that time include 
history of suicide attempts, history of abuse, chronic mental 
illness, Caucasian race, young age, and single relationship 
status.  Her modifiable risk factors included suicidal ideation 
without intent, medication noncompliance, lack of engagement 
with outpatient treatment,  limited coping skills, impulsivity,  
recent personal loss of relationship with significant other,  
and lack of engagement with outpatient treatment. The modifiable 
risk factors were addressed during hospitalization via 
medication management, psychotherapeutic intervention, and 
aftercare coordination.  Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective risk factors, including female 
gender, strong social supports, no chronic substance use, and no 
access to lethal weapons.  Overall, the patient is not at an 
acutely elevated risk of ___ nor danger to others due to 
acutely decompensated psychiatric illness.
