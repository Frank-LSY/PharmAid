Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ on ___ after a hernia repair for 
management of post-operative pain. You had an epidural catheter 
placed that has since been removed. You have recovered well and 
are now ready to go home. Please follow the instructions below 
to ensure a smooth recovery:

POST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS

1.Leave the plastic dressing on for 48 hours. You can shower 
(no bathing) with the dressing on for the first two days. 
2.Remove dressing after 2 days and leave the paper tapes 
(Steri-Strips) on the incision. You can shower (no bathing) 
after removal of dressing and get the Steri-Strips wet. If you 
prefer you can replace the dressing to keep your clothes from 
being soiled or from the stitches catching on your clothes. If 
you choose to replace dressing please do not use waterproof 
plastic dressings.
3.If the dressing has a little blood on it do not worry. You 
can change the dressing if it is stained. Apply new dressing 
with some mild pressure. 
4.The edges of Steri-Strips usually start curling at about 
___ days. The paper strips should be removed at 14 days. 
Rarely patients are sensitive to the glue on Steri-Strips in 
which case please remove the strips and inform us as we may need 
to use something else to keep the incision intact. 
5.You may notice some staining of the Steri-Strips with bloody 
or yellowish discharge, this is normal. In addition some 
swelling around the site of surgery is also normal. 
6.Use of an ice pack/bag is recommended for the first 24- 48 
hours as it reduces       inflammation, swelling and pain. Place 
ice pack for 10 Â– 20 minutes when convenient. You do not need to 
wake up at night to ice the site of surgery.DO NOT place ice 
pack for longer than 20 minutes on your incisions. Give a 30 
minute gap between placement of ice pack on incision. 
7.Please take first dose of pain medication before anesthetic 
wears off. Take pain medication regularly for the first ___ 
hours and then as needed.
8.Avoid strenuous exercise after your surgery.  Resume physical 
activity when site of surgery does not hurt without pain 
medication performing said activity.
9.    After inguinal hernia repair wear briefs, jock strap 
during the day for minimum of one week.
10. Consume a diet with plenty of non caffienated fluids, plenty 
of fiber. Consider use of a fiber supplement like Konsyl, 
Metamucil, Benefiber or Citrucel. All these measures will 
prevent constipation and thus straining. 
11. You can perform all your acitvities of daily living. AVOID 
lifting weights heavier than 30lbs for a total duration of 6 
weeks after open surgery and 2 weeks after laparoscopic surgery. 
Please note chronic cough, chronic constipation, excessive 
lifting of heavy weights and weight gain predispose to 
recurrence of hernia
12. Call the office at ___ if you have any 
of the following:
A.Persistent drainage of blood or pus from the incision
B.A fever higher than 101 degrees.
C.If the skin around the incision or incision is very red,
