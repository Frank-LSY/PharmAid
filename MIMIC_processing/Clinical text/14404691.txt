History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old woman with a
history of depression and ETOH use, who presented intoxicated 
and
reporting SI.  History difficult to obtain due to mildly slurred
speech and very slow, vague responses to questions at this time.
Her ETOH level on arrival was 347 at 2:05AM, seen by this
examiner at 5:15AM.  

     She states came into the hospital because of "sadness" for
years, though worse over the past few weeks.  Can't describe a
definitive stressor that had been making things worse initially. 

Over the last few days she states it has been hard to "exist". 
She lives in an apartment alone in ___, getting financial
support from her parents, moved to ___ 1.5 months ago from
___, reports that she was raped a few months ago by a friend 
and
this was one of the reasons she moved.  She states she doesn't
have close friends or supports in the area, in process of 
getting
a job at a coffee shop nearby.  She had been drinking "a lot" of
vodka daily (cannot tell me exact amount at this time).  While
intoxicated, states she had been texting multiple friends and
eventually called her sister who lives in ___ for help, has
difficulty remembering exactly what she told them but admits may
have been related to suicidal thoughts.  She thinks her sister
probably called ___ and police arrived at her apartment.  

     She states she is having suicidal thoughts, has wanted to
hurt self over the past few weeks.  When asking about intent if
she were to leave hospital, states there is high possibility of
killing herself in the future, probably with a gun, and is later
inconsistent about intent to actually follow-through on this or
not (has friends with guns per patient report but does not own
one herself).  She said might also use knives to cut herself in
the future, has frequent urges to cut arms but hasn't done this
in a year.  When she used to cut, would have bursts of doing it
for a few days in a row then stop.  Over the past few nights 
said
she wanted to end it all (cannot be more specific about what 
this
means currently), with this thought frequently worse at night. 
She states her eating is decreased, sleeps ___ hours/night, has
terrible concentration, has increased feelings of guilt, states
feeling hopeless, last night was feeling pretty suicidal, and
decreased interests.  
     She states sometimes having nightmares, denies flashbacks,
reports hypervigilance, frequent avoiding reminders of past
issues, states having past sexual trauma in the past (example,
states was raped a few months ago by a friend) and additional
abuse as a teenager (does not wish to discuss in detail at this
time).  
 She denied any manic symptoms, including elevated mood, 
reduced
sleep with increased energy, racing thoughts, or pressured
speech. She states sometimes has "slight auditory
hallucinations", "sometimes I hear screaming when waking up in
the morning", denies VH, denies paranoia.  Doesn't give clear
answer when asking about whether there are history of delusions. 


Collateral information from ___.
     The patient called ___ intoxicated stating she wanted to
commit suicide (with statement of "I'm just done," "I want to be
happy so badly", wasn't discussing a specific plan), moved 3
weeks (different report than from patient).  States the patient
gave sister the go-ahead to call for help.  In the past patient
had not wanted help and had to drag to the hospital.  In the
___, patient had tried to jump down a stair-well (not sure if
suicide attempt or drunk), then moved with her parents who were
trying to help patient get additional therapy after this. 
Believes patient has severe depression, anxiety and alcohol use
on top of it.  States has made comments to her sister before 
that
knows how to say things in psych. evaluation to get out of there

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE SECTION OF DISCHARGE SUMMARY
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a ___ and signed a CV on 
the next day. She was on q15 and green sharps throughout, with 
good behavior on the milieu.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Major Depressive Disorder vs. Substance-Induced Mood 
Disorder: Given her history of chronic severe anxiety since 
childhood and depressive episodes and passive suicidality since 
early adolescence, she likely has MDD as indicated by her 
anhedonia, trouble with concentration, loss of appetite, low 
mood, suicidal ideation and prior attempts, sleep disturbances, 
and loss of interest in her usual passtimes which have lasted 
for significant periods of time throughout her life. She has hx 
of lacking response from several antidepressants. She was 
continued on Venlafaxine 150mg QHS which she finds moderately 
helpful. In context of anxiety and possible Bipolar diathesis, 
we started lamotrigine 25mg QHS. She found the venlafaxine and 
lamotrigine moderately helpful. At the time of discharge, she 
felt that her mood was brighter and her affect was congruently 
so. She remained affectively anxious but subjectively rated her 
anxiety ___.

#) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: Due to intrusive, avoidant, 
mood/cognitive, arousal/reactivity symptoms and a history of 
trauma exposure lasting for longer than 1 month, she meets 
criteria for PTSD. We started Prazosin, first at 1mg, and 
titrated up to 3 mg with a reduction in the severity of 
nightmares, cessation of being awoken due to nightmares, and 
generally describing her dreams as "stressful" instead of 
"nightmarish." She was seen by CVPR who recommended she see a 
trauma-informed therapist.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Alcohol Use Disorder: She reports a significant history of 
daily hard liquor consumption, but says that she intentionally 
does not keep track of the amount. She initially scored on CIWA 
protocol on admission, requiring 20mg total of diazepam that 
night, but she did not require further CIWA-indicated 
benzodiazepines after that time. She did not find AA helpful, 
was somewhat interested in SMART, and was interested in 
attending dual-diagnosis IOP after discharge.

4. MEDICAL
#) No acute or chronic medical problems.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. She was often around in the 
milieu and interacted with nursing students and other patients.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Sister ___ ___.
Sister ___ ___.

# Parents # Number

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Continued Venlafaxine 150mg, started Lamotrigine 
25mg QHS, started Prazosin 3mg QHS.
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Pt's mother arrived to ___ area. Family meeting was held. 
Pt's mother was provided w psychoeducation. Pt's mother was 
supportive of discharge plan.

-Pt was also provided with psycho-education about mind-body
techniques as a way to cope with anxiety. We did a short 
exercise
(Progressive Muscle Relaxation). Pt had reasonably good 
response. She expressed interest in learning more about and 
practicing on the outpatient basis.

- Coordination of aftercare: Therapist/Psychiatrist, IOP, 
Substance Abuse treatment arranged as per discharge section of 
the summary. Her mother flew in and was planning on staying with 
her after discharge.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, she reported unclear and inconsistent reports 
of suicidal intent and different plans (such as either using 
knives or shooting self with gun), for that reason and due to 
the risk factors listed below, she was felt to have significant 
risk of harm to herself, meeting ___ criteria, with 
inpatient hospitalization being the least restrictive means of 
treatment at that time.   

Static risk factors include reports of past suicide attempts, 
past self-injurious behaviors, past trauma, Caucasian ethnicity. 
 Modifiable risk factors include current SI, with unclear and 
inconsistent reporting of intent and different possible plans 
reported, chronic alcohol use, recent sexual assault, limited 
social supports in ___ area after recent move, current 
unemployment. Her modifiable risk factors were addressed via 
inpatient hospitalization for stabilization, medication 
management, group and milieu therapy, diagnostic clarification, 
supervised alcohol withdrawal, and provision of a safe discharge 
plan including outpatient treatment. Protective factors include 
fairly good reality testing, cognitive facility, and family 
support.

At this time, our prognosis is guarded, as she has moved away 
from much of her support system to a new and stressful 
environment and will need to remain abstinent from alcohol in 
order to fully thrive in the community.
