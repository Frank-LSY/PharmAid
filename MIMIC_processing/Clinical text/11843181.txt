Discharge Instructions:
It is normal to feel tired or washed out after surgery. Rest is 
important and will help you feel better. Walking is also 
important. It will help prevent problems and help you feel 
stronger and have more energy. Just remember to pace yourself 
and rest when you feel tired.

What should I expect after surgery?
- It is normal to have a sore throat and pain in your ear after 
surgery.
- After surgery you will notice white patches on the sides of 
your throat. This is normal.

My Special Instructions:
- Putting an ice pack on your throat and eating ice chips may 
help you feel better.
- Use a humidifier or vaporizer for comfort.
- Drink plenty of fluids.

How do I manage my pain? 
-Some pain is normal after surgery. 
-For mild pain take acetaminophen (Tylenol). Acetaminophen 
(Tylenol) is contained in many medicines. Do not take Tylenol in 
addition to another product that contains Tylenol such as 
Percocet, Vicodin or Tylenol#3 unless recommended by your 
doctor. Do not take more than 4,000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours. 
-For moderate-to-severe pain you have been given a prescription 
for a pain medication in a group of medicines called "opioids." 
You have the option to request that this prescription be filled 
at a lesser quantity. If you choose to not fill the full 
prescription, you will not be able to receive the rest of the 
prescription at a later date.  
-Be sure to take opioid medication responsibly and as directed. 
Do not drink alcohol/drive/operate machinery while taking opioid 
pain medication. -Please wean your pain medication as your pain 
decreases. 
-Narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation. To make it 
easier to have a bowel movement: 
Drink extra fluids. 
Eat foods high in fiber. 
Take a stool softener like docusate (Colace). Take a stool 
softener while taking any opioid pain medication to prevent 
constipation. 
-Be sure to safely dispose of any unused opioid medication once 
it is no longer needed  
-If your pain medicine is not working, call your doctors 
office.

How do I take care of myself at home?

Diet
- Start by drinking water and other fluids like juice, tea, and 
broth.
- Drink plenty of fluids. Getting enough fluids is an important 
part of your recovery.
- Do not eat food until your stomach feels better.
- Eat light foods and soft solids in the beginning like ice 
cream, yogurt, and mashed potatoes.
- Avoid sharp, dry, or rough foods such as crackers, pretzels, 
potato chips, or pizza crust for 2 weeks.

Showering and Bathing

Activity

your head. After 2 weeks you can slowly begin any activity.

medicine, do not drive, drink alcohol, or make any important 
decisions.
