NCHCT at OSH (___): NCHCT: punctate hyperdensity in R 
caudate 

MRI & MRA BRAIN AND MRA (___): 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Late acute infarct involving the right corona radiata with 
associated 
T2/FLAIR abnormality.  No acute hemorrhage. 
2. Nonvisualization of the right V4 segment is likely 
congenital.  
Differential includes severe stenosis in the appropriate 
clinical setting. 
3. 1-2 mm outpouching of the right carotid terminus likely 
represents an 
infundibulum of the posterior communicating artery, although 
aneurysm is not 
entirely excluded. 
4. Additional visualized carotid arteries, vertebral arteries 
and major 
branches are patent.  No high-grade stenosis or evidence of 
dissection. 
5. Chronic right caudate head and left posterior limb of 
internal capsule 
infarcts with hemosiderin staining from chronic blood products. 

Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, 
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF = 65%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with HTN, HLD, and DM2 c/b peripheral 
neuropathy who was admitted to the Neurology stroke service with 
transient R facial droop and R foot heaviness secondary to an 
acute ischemic stroke in the right corona radiata. Labs notable 
for an A1c of 7.1% and an LDL of 79. MRI & MRA BRAIN notable for 
acute right corona radiate lacunar stroke, chronic strokes in 
the right caudate head and the left posterior limb of the 
internal capsule. His stroke was most likely secondary to small 
vessel disease given lacunar appearance on imaging and history 
of HTN and DM. Echocardiogram showed no PFO and normal size LA 
with increased volume in the LA. He was started on ASA 81 mg in 
addition to his home antihypertensives and Atorvastatin 20 mg. 
His deficits had already improved greatly prior to presentation 
and the only notable weakness was ___ strength in the right 
triceps, with decreased sensation to pinprick in right first 
with intact proprioception (present for the past 2 months). He 
will not require therapy for these deficits. He will be 
discharged to home with 30 day cardiac monitor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right facial weakness 
and right leg heaviness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, 
a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
-Hypertension
-Diabetes Mellitus Type 2

We are changing your medications as follows:
Take aspirin 81 mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
