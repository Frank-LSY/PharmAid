Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You came in with abdominal pain and diarrhea and were found to 
have a stone in your biliary tract for which you were 
transferred to our hospital. Fortunately after review of the 
scans and your blood tests, it was determined that you did not 
need an endoscopic procedure to retrieve this stone as it is 
small and not causing any obstruction / blockage. We did find 
that you had positive testing for C difficile which likely 
explains both your abdominal pain and diarrhea. For this we have 
started you on oral vancomycin which you should continue as 
directed through ___ (last dose ___ 
___). This will be a total of 10 days. 

Your home medications were unchanged.  Your INR on ___ was 
1.9, so you are recommended to recheck this tomorrow, ___, and 
discuss the result with your PCP to determine if the dose needs 
to be adjusted.
