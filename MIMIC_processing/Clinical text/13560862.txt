Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure meeting you and taking care of you. You were 
transferred to ___ for management of infected kidney stone 
that blocking urine from draining from your kidney to your 
bladder. You were seen by our urologists and interventional 
radiologists who recommended placement of percutaneous 
nephrostomy tube. This resulted in significant improvement in 
your symptoms and normalization of your kidney function. This 
did not remove your stone and you will need to followup with 
urology to remove this stone. Urology should schedule removal of 
your percutaneous nephrostomy tube after the stone has been 
removed. There was also a concern that the stone was infected 
and so you were given IV antibiotics and then transitioned to 
oral antibiotics with improvement in your white blood cell count 
and fevers. You will need to continue to take these antibiotics 
as an outpatient. 

You will need to followup at the appointments below with your 
new PCP and ___. 

We wish you the best, 

Your ___ team
