IMAGING:
========

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS (___) 
1. A 2.4 cm right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma with mild 
surrounding 
edema and local mass effect with no midline shift. 
2. No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm, dissection, 
vascular 
malformation or significant luminal narrowing. 

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST (___)
1. 2.8 x 2.8 x 2.1 right frontal lobe hematoma with surrounding 
edema and mild  local mass effect.  No evidence of associated 
abnormal enhancement or vascular  malformation. 

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (___)
1. 2.1 x 1.9 cm relatively hyperdense lesion at the lower pole 
of the left kidney, incompletely characterized on this 
single-phase study.  While this 
could represent a high-density cyst, a primary renal malignancy 
cannot be 
excluded.  Renal MRI is recommended for further 
characterization. 
2. A 9 x 6 mm lucency with a sclerotic rim in the left iliac 
bone most likely represents a benign bone lesion, though 
malignancy cannot be entirely excluded, particularly in the 
absence of prior studies to document stability. 
3. 1.3 x 1.0 cm exophytic hypodensity arising from the lower 
pole of the left  kidney, likely a simple renal cyst. 
4. Nonobstructing left renal stone. 
5. Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities scattered throughout the 
liver, likely  simple cysts or hematomas. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
1. No evidence of intrathoracic malignancy.  Essentially normal 
chest CT except  for right lower lobe potentially calcified 
pulmonary nodule that will be  suggesting prior granulomatous 
exposure. 

CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM ___:
Unremarkable 5 vessel cerebral angiogram.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of HTN who 
presented with dysarthria and facial twitching, who was found to 
have a right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, predominantly in the 
premotor region on an outside hospital ___. CTA head and neck 
showed no stenosis, significant atherosclerosis, large aneurysm, 
or AVM. Etiology presumed to be hypertensive, exacerbated by 
periods of overexertion. In addition, there could have been an 
underlying cavernous hemangioma that bled under the 
circumstances mentioned above. He underwent conventional 
angiography which showed no evidence of AVM. However he will 
follow with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic to determine the 
need for a repeat angio. We would prefer to wait until the 
hemorrhage has cleared and then repeat an MRI with contrast to 
see if there is any abnormality.

In terms of risk modification, we have counseled him that overly 
vigorous exercise may increase his risk of future hemorrhagic 
events. We advised him to continue his home lisinopril, avoid 
extreme exercise, and monitor daily blood pressure/heart rate to 
maintain them in an appropriate range. 

Also, a CT torso done in the context of supraclavicular nodes 
demonstrated a left renal hypodensity, likely a cyst, to be 
followed-up with an outpatient MRI. 

He will follow-up with neurosurgery, neurology and his PCP.

Discharge Condition:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital due to symptoms of difficulty 
speaking and facial twitching, resulting from an acute 
intracerebral hemorrhage, a condition where there is bleeding 
from a blood vessel in the brain. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain can result in a variety of symptoms. 
Imaging of your head and neck (non-contrast head CT and CTA head 
and neck) showed a right sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage. It 
did not show evidence of a mass or an arteriovenous malformation 
(AVM). This was confirmed with another type of imaging, MRI. You 
also had an angiogram performed by the vascular neurosurgeons, 
and they will see you as an outpatient for follow up. We are 
recommending a CT angiogram of your head and neck in ___ months 
before you are submitted to another conventional angiography. 

Also, a CT of your torso showed what is likely a cyst in your 
left kidney. This will be followed-up with an outpatient MRI for 
further investigation.  

Bleeding in the brain can have many different causes, so we 
assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk 
of this. We do think that the cause is likely hypertension. In 
order to prevent future bleeding in the brain, we plan to modify 
those risk factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Hypertension
- Overexertion during exercise

Our plan is as follows:
- Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily, your blood pressure medication.
- Monitor blood pressure at home.
- Avoid exercise that excessively increases your heart rate.
  
Instructions: 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since hemorrhagic stroke 
can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and 
persistence of these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
