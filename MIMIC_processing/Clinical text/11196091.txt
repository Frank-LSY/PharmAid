presented to and outside hospital and was found to have a left 
___ finger fracture with open skin tear and bilateral maxillary 
sinus fractures. She had a CT scan of the head, neck, and chest 
xray that were negative for any other acute injuries. She was 
alert, oriented, and hemodynamically stable. She was seen and 
evaluated by the hand surgery team who did a bedside washout of 
her hand, placed a splint, and recommended elevation, 
antibiotics, and outpatient follow up. She was admitted to the

patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. She was given cefazolin IV 
and then transitioned to oral Keflex for treatment of an open 
hand fracture. The patient's blood counts were closely watched 
for signs of bleeding, of which there were none. The patient 
received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used 
during this stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as 
early as possible.

On HD2 she had a new splint placed on her right hand by 
occupational therapy. She was seen and evaluated by physical 
therapy who recommended home with physical/occupational therapy.

On HD4 she was discharged to home with visiting nursing and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service on ___ 
after a fall. You were found to have a right ___ finger fracture 
and skin tear. You were seen and evaluated by the hand surgery 
team who treated your skin tears and placed a splint on your 
hand. You should continue to wear the splint at all times until 
your follow up appointment. You can wear a sling on your arm for 
comfort. Do not bear weight in you right hand. Please elevate 
your right arm on pillows as much as possible.  

You were also found to have facial fractures. These fractures 
will continue to heal over time and do not require surgery. You 
should continue to follow sinus precautions listed below. You 
can follow up in the plastic surgery clinic as needed if you 
have any questions or concerns.

You were seen and evaluated by physical and occupational therapy 
who recommend discharge to home with family support, home 
physical therapy, and home visiting nursing services. 

You are now doing better, tolerating a regular diet, and pain is 
better controlled. You are now ready to be discharged to home to 
continue your recovery.

Please note the following discharge instructions: 
Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the 
Emergency Department for any of the following:
*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or 
tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your 
medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, 
or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid 
heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a 
bowel movement.
*You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your 
urine, or experience a discharge.
*Your pain in not improving within ___ hours or is not gone 
within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is 
getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or 
back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern 
you.

Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically 
advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take 
any new medications as prescribed.

Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times 
per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. Avoid lifting 
weights greater than ___ lbs until you follow-up with your 
surgeon.

Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain 
medications.

Sinus Precautions:
Certain precautions will assist healing and we ask that you 
faithfully follow these instructions:

1. Take the prescribed medications as directed.

2. Do not forcefully spit for several days.

3. Do not smoke for several days.

4. Do not use straws for several days.

5. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even 
though your sinus may feel stuffy or there may be some nasal 
drainage.

6. Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If 
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

7. Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew 
on the opposite side of your mouth.

8. Do not rinse vigorously for several days. GENTLE salt water 
swishes may be used. Slight bleeding from the nose is not 
uncommon for several days after the surgery. Please keep our 
office advised of any changes in your condition, especially if 
drainage or pain increases. It is important that you keep all 
future appointments until this condition has resolved.
