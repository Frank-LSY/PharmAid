History of Present Illness:
Patient is poor historian. History obtained via records from 
OSH. Per reports, husband noticed patient being increasingly 
weak and tired the past couple days along with a chronic cough 
the past few months. Patient's husband notes that she hasn't 
been eating well for years but her husband has been trying to 
get her to eat. She reports on ___, she was walking while out 
on the porch with the dog and she tripped over the dog's leash. 
She hit her head on the ground. She hurt her left ankle at that 
time. She fell again the same day. She notes that she never lost 
consciousness. She states that she is able to walk on flat 
ground prior to her injury. Also having poor PO intake per 
record. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or 
history of heart problems. At OSH she had a CT head which showed 
a small, chronic left inferior cerebellar infarct but no 
evidence of acute intracranial trauma. Initial troponin I was 
0.24 (upper range of normal 0.041). EKG demonstrated new deep 
TWI in V3-5. She was given aspirin 325mg and transferred to 
___ for cardiology evaluation. 

In the ED, initial vitals were T ___, HR 55, BP 154/79, RR 18, 
O2 sat 96% on 2L NC. Labs were significant for Cr 1.0, Trop 
<0.01, and INR 1.2. EKG demonstrated NSR with left atrial 
abnormality, right axis deviation, QT prolongation (523 msec), Q 
waves aVR, V1, and V2, and TWI in II, III, aVF, and TWI in V2-5. 
Bedside echo reportedly demonstrated right ventricular dilation, 
so patient was sent for CTA.

On the floor she notes that she is severe pain, but states that 
she has been in this pain since ___ after she was jumped by a 
group of inmates where she worked as a ___. She notes that 
she underwent surgery at ___ that failed to improve her pain. 
Patient had a stroke in ___. She had trouble with eyes, 
hearing, and speech. No lower extremity weakness. 

Of note, she recently violated her controlled substance contract 
and her pain medication dosage is currently being tapered by her 
PCP: ___ ER 15mg tid (originally morphine 60mg qAM and 30mg 
qPM), and lorazepam 0.5mg bid (originally 1mg bid).

STUDIES:
========
EKG ___: NSR with left atrial abnormality, right axis 
deviation, QT prolongation (523 msec), Q waves aVR, V1, and V2, 
and TWI in II, III, aVF, and TWI in V2-5  

CTA Chest ___:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. Severe emphysema. 
3. Dilated pulmonary arteries is suggestive of chronic pulmonary 
hypertension. 
4. Mild bilateral wall thickening of the small airways suggests 
infectious or 
inflammatory small airway disease. 
5. Bilateral hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy is likely 
reactive. 

TTE ___:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular 
wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal 
regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 61 %. 
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No 
ventricular septal defect is seen. The right ventricular free 
wall is hypertrophied. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity 
with normal free wall motion. There is abnormal interventricular 
septal motion c/w right ventricular pressure and volume 
overload. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the 
severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. There 
is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is a trivial pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No patent foramen ovale identified. Right 
ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity dilation with normal 
systolic function and flattening of the interventricular septum 
during systole and diastole consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. Normal left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and regional systolic function. At least 
moderate tricuspid regurgitation (may be UNDERestimated). 
Moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ PMH of COPD, CVA, and chronic back pain presents as 
transfer from OSH due to concern for NSTEMI though trop neg x2 
here and patient without cardiac chest pain.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
# Possible NSTEMI: 
Patient was found to have elevated troponin I at presentation to 
OSH to 0.24, with upper limit of normal 0.041. Bedside TTE 
demonstrated possible RV dilation. EKG demonstrated new 
symmetric, deep TWI in V2-5, initially thought to be consistent 
with ischemia, however pattern more consistent with RV 
overload/strain. Troponin negative x 3. CTA without PE, severe 
emphysema, dilated pulmonary arteries suggestive of chronic 
pulmonary HTN, and likely infectious vs inflammatory small 
airway disease. TTE demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension, 
but no evidence of regional WMA. She will need outpatient follow 
up for severe pulmonary hypertension with workup to potentially 
include high res chest CT, sleep study, and right heart cath 
with vasodilator. Will also likely need inflammatory workup. 

# Fall history: 
Patient has experienced multiple falls in the past several 
months. Per report, likely mechanical falls in setting of 
deconditioning and poor nutrition. Likely exacerbated by high 
does of opioids and recent changes to opioid regimen along with 
marijuana use. 

# Hyperglycemia: Patient with pre-prandial hypoglycemia and 
postprandial hyperglycemia. A1c pending. Will need follow up as 
outpatient to assess for Type II diabetes. 

# Prolonged QTc: Prolonged to 520. Held sertraline and 
trazadone. Should have repeat EKG as outpatient for 
consideration of continuation of medications. Until then, 
instructed to hold medications. 

# PAML: 
- Obtained from PCP: ___, DO

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
[] Outpatient referral to pulmonary for evaluation of pulmonary 
hypertension and small airway inflammation. Most likely related 
to progressive COPD, however may require high resolution CT of 
the chest, sleep study, and possible right heart catheterization 
with vasodilator. 
[] Consider referral for neurology for evaluation of confusion
[] Continue to wean pain medication as likely contributing to 
risk of falls
[] Patient with highly elevated post-prandial glucose and 
hypoglycemia pre-meal. Please evaluate for diabetes. 
[] f/u A1c
[] Referral to outpatient physical therapy for left ankle injury
[] QTc prolonged to 520ms and sertraline and trazadone held. 
Please assess for QTc prior to continuing these medications and 
ensure patient has stable magnesium.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
  
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were transferred from another hospital after a blood test 
they performed show elevated cardiac enzymes concerning for 
possible heart attack.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You received a CT scan of your chest because there was concern 
for a blood clot in your lungs. The scan did not show any clots 
in your lung but did show findings consistent with COPD and high 
blood pressure in arteries of your lungs.
- Your heart enzymes were checked 3 times and were not elevated 
here at ___.
- You had an ultrasound of your heart which showed no evidence 
of a hole in your heart that could have caused your stroke. You 
had high pressures in the pulmonary arteries. This is likely 
related to your COPD. You should follow up with your 
pulmonologist for consideration of further workup. 
- We spoke with your primary care doctor who explained that you 
are currently being tapered from your long-acting pain regimen. 
You should follow up with him to discuss this taper further. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Continue to take all your medicines and keep your appointments
- Follow up with your primary care doctor and continue to have a 
follow up for your COPD with a lung doctor (___). 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!
