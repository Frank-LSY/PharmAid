isolated masks, and seeing and hearing his deceased father
telling him not to eat food because his mother is poisoning it 
and not to leave home because people will harm him. He also

memory, pt denies SI. Pt denies symptoms of mania. Pt endorses 
auditory and visual hallucinations as described above. And

Brief Hospital Course:
----Psychiatric

# Schizophrenia: The patient presented to the unit with a 
history of recent decline since ___ with prominent negative 
symptoms of apathy, isolation, and anhedonia and prominent 
positive symptoms of visual hallucinations of seeing masks, 
auditory hallucinations of hearing numerous voices, and severe 
disorganization. He was started on zyprexa 10mg BID which he 
tolerated well without any noted or reported side effects and 
good efficacy in that the patient noted it made him feel 
"safer," reduced the intensity and frequency of his auditory 
hallucinations, and also decreased the vividness of his visual 
hallucinations. This medication was increased to 15mg BID which 
he also continued to tolerate well and noted continued improved 
response. On day four of hospitalization the patient endorsed 
only minor "background" auditory hallucination and "few" visual 
hallucinations of masks. He also noted he no longer felt 
"scared" and was able to socialize with other patients on the 
unit. He was able to participate in group therapy and individual 
therapy in which the team helped the patient understand the 
diagnosis of schizophrenia and the importance of continuing with 
outpatient care and always taking all prescribed medications and 
not ever sharing or taking other's medications. On discharge the 
patient reported
feeling "back to baseline." His exam was notable for now a 
linear and logical thought process, good insight and judgement, 
and no SI, HI, or AVH. A ___ application was also submitted for 
the patient and he was also provided with mental health follow 
up.

----Medical: No acute issues. Vitals were check on a daily basis 
as well as review of symtpoms.

with peers, active on the unit, and had no safety problems on 
the unit.

#Family Meeting / Discussions
___: Attended by team, patient, patient's mother, 
and patient's girlfriend. They described his growing paranoia, 
hallucinations, and decline for the past six months since his 
father's death. and expressed their concern at his condition. 
They also noted that seeing the patient now in the hospital, he 
already appeared "better," specifically less paranoid and better 
able to tolerate their company. The family were supportive and 
educated about the plan for medication, DMH application, and 
discharge. His mother noted she felt comfortable with the 
patient soon leaving the hospital given the rapid rate of 
improvement.

#Collateral
Mother: ___ (___): She confirmed the above 
the HPI and added that though he denied SI, ___ months ago he 
tried to jump out of a ___ floor window, but she stopped him. 
She stated that he has 3 brothers with schizophrenia. She also 
said that the pt has 3 children with an ex-girlfriend, and 
sometimes he does not recall this, sometimes he does. She said 
that when he was ___ y/___ he was evaluated by his school and they 
were told there was something wrong with his brain including 
reading problems (it was unclear to me if this was anything 
beyond a learning disability) and that the pt at that time had 
an imaginary friend. She felt he needed admission when he was in 
the ED.

----Legal Status: Patient was admitted on a CV and remained on 
such throughout the admission.

----Risk Assessment
This patient has a low to moderate risk of imminent danger to 
himself or others. The patient has numerous protective factors 
including no prior history of mental illness, no history of 
suicide attempts or self injurious behavior, no access to 
weapons, no substance abuse, future orientation, and a 
supportive family. Still he does have the risk factor of newly 
diagnosed schizophrenia as a risk factor as well as a strong 
family history of schizophrenia. While in the hospital we 
treated his schizophrenia by starting the patient on medications 
he responded well to, connecting him with outpatient mental 
health follow up, hold a family meeting, providing him with both 
individual and group therapy, and helping him establish DMH 
services. Given his numerous protective factors and improvement 
in his schizophrenia at this time, the patient no long warrants 
inpatient level of care although remains as a low to moderate 
risk of danger to himself or other secondary to schizophrenia.
