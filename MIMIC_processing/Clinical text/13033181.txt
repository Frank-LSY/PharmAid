History of Present Illness:
EU Critical ___ is an ___ F with h/o HTN, DM and HLD who
presented as a transfer to the ED from an OSH after being found
down and CT showing large left temporo-parietal-occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift, subfalcine and
early uncal herniation. 

She was in her usual state of health until this evening she was
at home watching TV and she got up to go to the bathroom.  After
about 10 minutes her grandson went to check on her because she
had been gone awhile.  When he went to the bathroom he saw her
sitting on the toilet, slumped back and unresponsive.  EMS was
called who found her  unresponsive and she was intubated in the
field with succinylcholine only.  She was given Keppra 1000mg IV
and transferred to the OSH.  There she had a head CT that showed
a large left temporo-parietal IPH with midline shift and early
uncal herniation with blood in the left occipital horn and a
small subdural hematoma. 
 
She was transferred to ___ for Neurosurgical evaluation. 
Initially in the ED her SBPs were in the 150s but steadily
declined to the ___.  Her GCS was 3T and ICH score was 5. 
Neurosurgery was consulted and did not feel an intervention was
indicated in this case given the severity of the bleed and the
grave prognosis.  Neurology was consulted for further 
management.
