Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented from an OSH in a C-collar after CT 
C-spine showed odontoid type 2 fracture. He was seen by the 
neurosurgery service in the ED and admitted to the floor. He was 
neurovascularly intact. 

#C2 fracture
Patient was placed in a hard cervical collar. Neurologic 
examination reassuring. Imaging was reviewed.On ___, MRI C-spine 
showed some associated ligamentous injuries It was determined 
fracture would be managed conservatively with hard cervical 
collar at all times and follow up with repeat imaging in 1 
month. 

#Seizures

seizures takes oxycarbmazipine, risperidone and Ativan at home 
for his seizures. Neurology was consulted for his seizures. 
Levels of home AED  were sent and are still pending at time of 
discharge. MRI was done to r/o any source of seizure which was 
unrevealing. Investigation was done to determine frequency of 
patients seizures as this may impact whether or not he is a good 
surgical candidate.  However, the patient is very unreliable and 
cannot provide details regarding his AEDs raising suspicion for 
AED noncompliance even though he strongly denies this.  Also per 
his PCP, he has history of alcohol and cocaine abuse which can 
also provoke seizures. Patient did not have any further seizures

during this hospitalization. At time of discharge Holter monitor 
was ordered however patient does not have access to a landline 
telephone so he was unable to receive the monitor. He was 
scheduled for the next available Cardiology appointment to 
continue to monitor. 

#?Horner Syndrome

Given recent fall there was concern for possible dissection. A 
CTA head was obtained on ___ to further evaluate vascular injury 
___ left ptosis, which was read as preliminarily having ___ 
abnormalities, negative for dissection. 
 
Dispo: 
On ___ the patient continued to remain neurologically intact, 
with ___ more episodes of SVT or evidence of seizures during this 
admission. After further discussion with medicine and neurology 
it was determined that the patient was able to be discharged 
home with home services for home safety eval. The patient has 
been instructed to follow up with his PCP, ___, and 
Neurology for further evaluation and management. He will follow 
up with Neurosurgery in 1 month with CT of c-spine.
