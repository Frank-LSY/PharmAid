hyperlipidemia who presented with two different skin rashes that 
developed over the last week after staph skin infection 
treatment with TMP/SMX.

# Rash, two morphologies
# Transaminitis
Concern for both drug eruption from TMP/SMX and possible Lyme 
disease. Biopsies taken by Dermatology and awaiting results.  
Dermatology recommended triamcinolone cream and doxycycline for 
possible disseminated Lyme disease. No eosinophilia was noted so 
unlikely to be DRESS.  Hepatitis screen was negative.  RUQ US 
did not show liver disease, LFTs trending down at time of 
discharge, likely related to medication effect.  ___ pending, 
Lyme serology pending, RMSF serology, anti-smooth muscle 
antibodies pending and will need to be followed up.  Doxycycline 
will be continued for ___ days depending on PCP ___.  
Triamcinolone should be used for no longer than 14 days over the 
course of a month.  Skin biopsy was taken and is pending at the 
time of discharge, for which Dermatology will contact the 
patient with results.  She should have her LFTs rechecked upon 
PCP ___.  Sutures will need to be remvoed by her PCP or 
outpatient dermatologist.

# Bilateral mild hydronephrosis
# ___: creatinine was elevated on admission to 1.3, decreased 
quickly to 0.9.  She had mild hydronephrosis on imaging.  A 
repeat renal ultrasound should be considered as an outpatient.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin 

# HTN: continued chlorthalidone

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital with multiple rashes. 
 Further testing showed that you likely have a drug rash, and 
there is concern for Lyme disease.  You are being treated with 
an antibiotic, doxycycline, for this.  You have a 21 day supply 
of this currently, please take and ask your PCP when you can 
stop this medication.  A skin biopsy was performed and is 
currently pending.  The Dermatology team will call you with the 
results of this biopsy.  You are now being discharged.

You liver function tests were abnormal but are improving.  They 
will need to be rechecked when you follow up with your PCP.

It is important that you continue to take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up with the appointments listed below.

Good luck!
