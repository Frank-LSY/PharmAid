History of Present Illness:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman, freshman ___
& ___ major at ___, with a history
of anxiety who was sent to ___ from by NEU counselors after 
she
described suicidal ideation with a variety of plans. She has
thought about shooting herself with a gun, cutting her wrists or
her throat with a knife, and overdosing on pills. She states 
that
she has not "come close" to carrying out these plans. However,
she has thought about what she would write in a suicide note. 
She
has also considered asking her father about how she can get a 
gun
(she does not have access to one at present); she thinks she can
get away with that because he "would never suspect" it were for
suicide. She has also held a knife in her hands on several
occasions (i.e. while emptying the dishwasher) and thought about
what it'd be like to commit suicide right there. Regarding 
pills,
she has not thought about what pills she'd take. She does not
have a psychiatrist or therapist in the ___ area (has not 
seen
one since ___ grade, which at the time was for social
anxiety). She does not take any medications. She has not talked
to anyone about her thoughts and her family, who she identifies
as her primary support, are in ___ (she says tearfully
that she sometimes feels "alone" here). 
     The patient says that her thoughts about suicide started in
___. In sophomore year of high school (___),
she wrote a paper about the afterlife and the idea of there 
being
"nothing" after one dies; the idea scares her, and she often
ruminates on that though it causes her anxiety. Neither she nor
her family is religious. In senior year of HS (___), she
began to think about what it would be like to commit suicide. In
___, a classmate of hers committed suicide; she was not
his close friend and does not know how he completed the attempt.
     She endorses anxiety about topics other than death as well.
She often worries that she is not performing well in her classes
and is therefore "wasting [her] time." She describes herself as 
a
worrier - she is quite worried about finals, which start in 19
days. In addition to anxiety, she endorses symptoms of
depression, including depressed mood (feels very depressed 20% 
of
the time), anhedonia (takes weekly drum lessons but no longer
enjoys it), decreased concentration and motivation (skipping 
more
classes than usual), hypersomnia on weekends (15 hrs/day on
weekends, 9 hrs/day during the week), appetite disturbance
(sometimes goes ___ days without eating, but "thinks" she has 
not
lost or gained weight), and thoughts of inadequacy/failure and
suicide as noted above. Over the past ___ weeks, she has started
to become tearful and cry somewhat at various points throughout
the day.
     She denies symptoms of mania including periods of decreased
need for sleep, abnormally increased goal-directed activity,
pressured speech, grandiosity, elevated mood, etc. She denies
symptoms of psychosis, including paranoia and AH/VH, and 
provides
no evidence for delusion beliefs. She denies
obsessions/compulsions.

COLLATERAL FROM MOTHER (home # ___, given to me by the
patient, who gave me permission to discuss her history and
current status, and our plan with them):
     The patient had anxiety issues in early high school since
then has not talked about any sort of depression or suicidal
ideation. She texts with her family almost daily and Skypes with
them once per week. The family was in ___ visiting her last
weekend; per mother, the patient "seemed okay" at the time. The
patient's sister, however, has recently been having issues with
depression and anxiety. She (the sister) has been cutting 
herself
and was recently placed on Prozac, to good effect. There is no
family history of mania (including in the patient).
     The mother believes that the patient has "taken on too 
much"
during her freshman year in college. The patient is involved in
multiple business clubs, as well as "Peace through Play," which
she serves on the executive board of in several different roles.
The patient has been in a couple of relationships that she feels

starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon suicidal thoughts 
and thoughts of self harm.  Their static factors noted at that 
time include Caucasian race, age and marital status.   The 
modifiable risk factors included suicidal ideation, limited 
coping skills, no established outpatient treatment and academic 
stressors.  She was started on Luvox and set up with her 
school's mental health services.  She was also able to work with 
her school to reduce her academic stress.  Finally, the patient 
is being discharged with many protective risk factors including 
help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint and sense of 
responsibility to family.  Overall, based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

PROGNOSIS:
The patient's prognosis is good, due to the fact that she is 
medication adherent, connected to outpatient care, denies any 
suicidal thought, intent, or plan, and is future-oriented with 
plan to return to school.
