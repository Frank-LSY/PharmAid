IMAGING
=======
___ CXR
Probable right lower lobe aspiration or pneumonia. Trace right 
pleural effusion. Prominence of the mediastinum could reflect a 
dilated ascending aorta.  A dedicated CT of the chest may be 
obtained for further evaluation. 

___ CTA CHEST 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old man with a PMH of HTN, alcohol abuse, and 
prostate cancer, who presented after a fall, found to have 
pneumonia. 

ACTIVE ISSUSE
# Pneumonia: presented with SpO2 that dropped to 88% in ER, 
though maintained SpO2
>95% on room air after arriving to medical floor. CXR with 
possible right upper lobe aspiration vs pneumonia, without any 
SIRS criteria. Given Flagyl + ceftriaxone + azithromycin in ED, 
transitioned to Augmentin + azithromycin. CTA did not show any 
sign of pneumonia, so antibiotics stopped on discharge. 

# Widened mediastinum: observed on CXR. CTA obtained, which 
demonstrated no aortic aneurysm, borderline enlarged aorta.  

# Fall: mechanical in nature, in setting of etOH 
abuse/intoxication. CT head &
C-spine without acute process.  

# etOH abuse with intoxication: notes has been drinking less 
than previously. Last drink, day of admission. Is aware of 
alcohol cessation services near home, and is currently declining 
any intervention or help from SW. No signs of withdrawal while 
in house. Given thiamine, folate & MVI on discharge. Encouraged 
cessation. 

# T wave inversions: nonspecific EKG changes without previous 
EKG to compare. Troponin negative x3. 

# Sinus bradycardia: HR in ___. Stopped atenolol and HRs 
improving. BPs stable as well. Stopped atenolol on discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension: BPs in 130s, with holding of atenolol & 
monotherapy with lisinopril. Stopped atenolol on discharge. If 
BP elevated at follow up, would increase lisinopril.

# Normocytic anemia: unclear baseline given paucity of labs 
without acute bleeding. Likely marrow suppression from etOH. 

# Insomnia: continued trazodone. 

============================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
============================
- Stopped atenolol for bradycardia
- Watch BP; increase lisinopril PRN
- Encourage etOH cessation

I certify that 35 minutes were spent on coordination of care, 
face-to-face counseling & discharge planning.
