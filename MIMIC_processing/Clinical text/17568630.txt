History of Present Illness:

from the ED for more information regarding past psychiatric

history.

Briefly, this is a ___ w/ PPH schizophrenia who presented to
___ ED by ambulance with suicidal ideation and depressed mood
in the setting of alcohol intoxication.

This episode started when he was kicked out of his mother's 
house
two weeks ago. According to Mr. ___, she does not understand
him and was strongly against his alcohol use for religious
reasons, leading to his being kicked out of the house. He has
been living in a shelter since then and finds it very difficult.
Over the course of those two weeks, he became increasingly
depressed. On the night of presentation to the ED, he was had
become so miserable that he first tried to harm himself by 
trying
to drink enough alcohol that he would fall asleep and not wake
up. He then started thinking of jumping in front of the orange
line, but called the ambulance on himself.

At the time of presentation to the ED, he endorses low mood, 
lack
of motivation, low energy, anhedonia, and feeling like he should
"stay in bed and sleep the whole day," but with difficulty of
maintaining sleep. He also reports hearing a voice that sounds
like himself and says that he should hurt himself. However, on
admission to Deac 4, he says his mood has improved some and he 
is
no longer actively suicidal or hearing voices. He does reaffirm
having difficulty concentrating, low energy, and ___ sleep.

Notably, he does not describe any time at which he's had
depressive symptoms for more than one week. The periods of
depression that he describes are typically for a few days to a
week and in the setting of an acute psychosocial stressor (bad
breakup, being kicked out of the home.)

He first started drinking at age ___ and says that it was not a
problem until age ___, when he was drinking daily to the point
that he had started missing work. The auditory hallucinations 
did
not start until he was age ___. He had one period of sobriety for
2.5 months since then; he quit ___ and had stomach aches
and the sensation of crawling skin at that time, but no 
seizures,
losses of consciousness, or visual hallucinations.

He denies symptoms of mania, including periods of expansive 
mood,
decreased need for sleep, or increased risk-taking behavior.

He denies symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks, with no
experiences of racing heart beat, shortness of breath,
diaphoresis, or general feelings of anxiety.

He has had paranoid delusions, where he notes a voice in his 
head
that tells him touching an object will make him sick, but he
knows that the things the voice tells him are not true. He had
one experience where a friend made a statement and he felt like
that statement was stuck in his mind for a long time. He has
never had visual hallucinations. He denies thought broadcasting
and ideas of reference.

In addition to the positive depressive signs above, he denies
guilt, change in appetite, and loss of interest in things.

He does not plan to kill or harm himself or others on the unit.
If he has feelings that he will, he feels comfortable letting
myself and the rest of the unit staff know.

He does not want us to contact his mother at this time. He is OK
with his outpatient medical team being contacted.

He denies having ever lived in shelters before.

Course in Emergency Department:  required no chemical or 
physical
restraints.

General review of systems was negative for fevers, chills,
rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, 
nausea,
vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e
incontinence).

minute checks for the duration of stay.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
Suicidality: He was endorsing SI with plan to jump in front of

the rest of the hospitalization. He says that he has negative 
command auditory hallucinations that tell him disparaging things 
or to kill himself--these also resolved since admission.

Schizophrenia: He has many negative symptoms: anhedonia, flat 
affect, low interest in socializing, psychomotor retardation. 
These symptoms were stable or perhaps very mildly improved 
during the hospitalization. His positive symptoms of auditory 
hallucinations and intrusive thoughts resolved after admission. 
We increased his risperidone from 2mg BID to 2mg QAM and 4mg QHS 
due to reports of poor sleep. Because of his chronic psychosis 
and multiple recent hospitalizations, we placed a DMH 
application for him on ___.

having trouble with alcohol at 27. He has been to detox 
facilities and medical floors for alcohol withdrawal multiple 
times, including two S35 admissions submitted by his mother in 
this past year. He says he will drink 4 beers every other day, 
but admission EtOH levels have often been in the 370's and he 
has required alcohol withdrawal protocols in the past, implying 
a constant level of serum EtOH (and likely daily drinking). 
Although he was placed on CIWA upon admission here, he did not 
require any diazepam (did not score >10 at any point.) He was 
further provided with AA groups here on the unit and with AA 
information and referrals upon discharge.

4. MEDICAL
#) No acute medical problems.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL

The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. He rarely 
attended these groups and was usually only seen on the milieu 
around meals or in the evening watching TV.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Mother, ___, ___ spoken with by phone by 
___, ___; confirmed history and helped with 
discharge planning.

#) INTERVENTIONS

- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Home with mother. IOP referral, AA 
information, and follow-up appointments with psychiatry and 
primary care.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

Static Risk Factors: history of suicide attempts, history of
substance abuse, recent discharge from an inpatient psychiatric
unit, male gender, marital status.

Modifiable Risk Factors: hopelessness, social withdrawal, 
limited
social supports, limited coping skills, trouble sleeping, lack 
of
purpose, active substance abuse, and recent
housing loss. These risk factors were addressed by providing 
substance abuse groups and discharge information, inpatient unit 
for stabilization, medication changes to help with trouble 
sleeping, and discharge planning for social support and housing. 
Notably, we also submitted a ___ application for further social 
supports.

Protective Factors: help-seeking nature, reality testing
ability, good problem-solving skills, positive therapeutic
relationship with outpatient providers, current lack of suicidal
ideation.

Overall, our prognosis for this patient is guarded, as he has 
had multiple alcohol relapses and may lose his housing if he 
relapses again. He is vulnerable on the streets and will 
hopefully be provided with DMH resources for additional social 
and housing support.
