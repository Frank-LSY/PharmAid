Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

On POD#1: he was hyponatremic. He was fluid restricted to 1.5L 
and sodium levels responded appropriately.  Sodium at time of 
discharge was 134.  He also experienced tachycardia and was 
bolused 500ml of NS, he responded appropriately.  An EKG 
obtained showed sinus tachycardia.  Additionally, the patient 
noted bilateral hand numbness.  He was placed on Q2hr neuro 
checks.  The numbness resolved on its own.

On POD#2, the patient's WBC increased to 15.0.  A urinalysis and 
urine cultures were obtained.  Urinalysis was negative for UTI.  
Urine cultures were pending at time of discharge.  He was given 
another 1L NS bolus for tachycardia with appropriate response.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The patient was 
voiding independently this admission.  The surgical dressing was 
changed and the initial post-op dressing was removed on POD#2. 
The surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without 
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the wound was benign
