Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ y/o M with PMH of Gilberts disease and
depression who presents with recurrent nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea. Of note, that patient presented 2 weeks ago for a 
similar episode of nausea, vomiting that was attributed to viral 
gastroenteritis. He had no symptoms for 2 weeks, but then 
developed acute onset nausea vomiting and diarrhea. He initially 
had an elevated lactate in the ED requiring 4 L of fluid 
resuscitation and antiemetics. His symptoms rapidly improved 
after admission to the floor, with resolution of symptoms prior 
to discharge. Recurrent symptoms are most likely due to either 
viral gastroenteritis or - more likely - suspected contribution 
from cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in the setting of daily 
marijuana use.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea
# Leukocytosis
Patient presents with constellation of symptoms similar to 
episode 2 weeks prior. At that time his symptoms were attributed 
to viral gastroenteritis and improved with supportive care. 
Differential includes another viral gastroenteritis or 
food-borne
bacterial or toxin mediated process. Symptoms and chronicity 
also raised concern for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in setting 
of daily marijuana use, and improvement in symptoms while 
hospitalized and abstaining from cannabis use. The patient 
improved with supportive care, with IV fluids and antiemetics. 
Recommended that he undergo a diagnostic trial of abstinence 
from cannabis for at least one month, to which he was in 
agreement.

# Hyperbilirubinemia 
# ___ Syndrome
Patient has pattern of indirect hyperbilirubinemia - without 
evidence of hemolysis - in the setting of acute 
illness/stressors and otherwise normal LFTs and RUQUS, 
consistent with ___ syndrome. 

# Weight loss
Patient has suffered from 35 lb weight loss since starting 
college. Initial thoughts by outpatient provider was that it was 
due to depression. ESR and CRP were checked to rue out any 
inflammatory process (ie IBD, other occult inflammatory process) 
and were normal. Per patient and his mother, pt was initially 
unhappy in his first year of college, "too busy to eat," but 
spirits improved after transfer to ___. Weight loss should 
be further monitored/addressed as outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Depression
Continued FLUoxetine 40 mg PO DAILY 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[ ] Continue workup into patient's ongoing weight loss
