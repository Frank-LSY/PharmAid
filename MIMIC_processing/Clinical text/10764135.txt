2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) MDD 
Patient has a history of treatment responsive depression and has 
been seen as an outpatient for about ___ years.  Prozac was 
working well for her prior to admission, however, due to many 
family stressors, she became acutely more depressed, hopeless, 
tired and felt that if there was an easy way to go to sleep and 
not wake up she would do it.  She went to a scheduled outpatient 
psychiatry appointment and was distraught and endorsing SI so 
was sent to the ___ for evaluation and then admitted to the unit. 
 She reports many stressors, mostly revolving around her family 
including a recent divorce which she wanted but is still 
stressful and both of her children are transgender, drop outs 
from school, have mental health issues and are smoking pot 
frequently despite her asking them not to.  She has been taking 
care of her family with little outside help and working full 
time.  She described feeling like she had coped for a long time 
but was out of energy to keep going.
Patient was initially upset at being admitted, but she began to 
appreciate the break from her stressors at home.  She and her 
outpatient provider felt that ___ was helpful, so the dose 
was increased to 80 mg rather than switching to a different 
SSRI.  She participated in groups and reached out to many family 
members which were supportive.  Given that most of her stress 
was due to her children, a family meeting was arranged.  She 
found this helpful especially as her sister was able to come to 
the meeting and see how difficult the situation with her 
children is and was able to be supportive.  She concluded from 
this admission that she needs a break so rather than going right 
back to work and to her children, she is going to take some time 
off from work and living in the house with her children.  She is 
going to consider a partial program and she would like to work 
with a therapist more closely.  She will also continue to see 
___.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:

and sister.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon her level of 
distress and SI.  Their static factors noted at that time 
include Caucasian race, age and marital status (recently 
divorced).   The modifiable risk factors included hopelessness, 
limited social supports and recent personal loss (stress around 
children dropping out of school and using drugs).  Patient used 
hospitalization to increase her family support and to discuss 
with children and ex-husband her level of distress.  Team and 
patient discussed plan for her to take time away from these 
stressors, start more intensive therapy for herself and a 
partial program.  Finally, the patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors including help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, 
children in the home, life satisfaction, reality testing 
ability, good coping skills, good problem-solving skills, 
positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, no 
history of substance use disorder and no history of abuse.  
Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at this time, 
the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is good based on her very high 
level of function, ability to plan and cope and increased 
support network.
