History of Present Illness:
___ y/o man with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
hypertension not currently on medication, who presents with
rectus sheath hematoma. 

He states 2 weeks ago he got a cold with a severe cough and
rhinorrhea. He states in the setting of cough he began to have
LLQ pain. The pain would be worse after coughing. In that 
setting
he began to take ibuprofen and Excedrin. The dry cough

IMAGING:
___ CXR ___: 
IMPRESSION:  No typical dense consolidative opacity to suggest
pneumonia.  Suggestion of faint opacity projecting over the 
medial
aspect of the right clavicle appears similar to prior exam, 
though
slightly more conspicuous. This is likely due to overlapping 
structures
and technique of the current radiograph. A nonemergent 
follow-upradiograph of the chest in 1 week is recommended to 
further evaluate this area and exclude underlying lesion. 

___ ABDOMEN ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. 9.2 x 5.2 x 9.5 cm left rectus abdominus hematoma with a
punctatefocus of venous extravasation.  No associated arterial
extravasation.
2. No intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
3. Indeterminate 2.5 x 1.9 cm right hepatic lesion without a
correlate on arterial phase imaging, potentially representing
postsurgical change after prior cholecystectomy (such as
fibrosis/scarring).  An MRI may be considered for further
evaluation on a nonurgent basis.
      
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider liver MRI for further evaluation of
the right hepatic lesion.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  ___ y/o man with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, 
hypertension not currently on medication, who presents with a 
rectus abdominus hematoma in the setting of excessive coughing 
and being on Coumadin.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 

#Rectus Abdominus Hematoma - Likely spontaneous in the setting 
of coughing while on Coumadin, though INR was not 
Supratherapeutic on admission.  He has recently been taking 
ibuprofen for the pain, which may have exacerbated the bleeding. 
 He was monitored for 36 hours and his hemoglobin remained 
stable between 12.3-13.7 mg/dL for >24 hours.  His Coumadin was 
held, given INR was <3 and he was otherwise stable, he was not 
reversed.  His INR was 2.0 upon discharge and Coumadin was held 
on discharge with instructions to have his Hgb to be checked 
this week - if stable, his Coumadin can likely be restarted.  

CHRONIC ISSUES:

#Atrial Fibrillation - CHADS2VASC score 3 for age, gender, 
hypertension. He has never
had a stroke and his rate has been well controlled on no 
medications. Given the rectus abdominus hematoma, his Coumadin 
was held on discharge with instructions to have his Hgb to be 
checked this week - if stable, his Coumadin can likely be 
restarted.  

#Incidental CXR finding - his CXR demonstrated a shadow over the 
clavicle which is likely from overlapping structures and 
technique, a repeat xray on a non-urgent basis is recommended 

#Incidental liver finding - his CT abdomen demonstrated a 
hepatic lesion likely from post-surgical scarring from  prior 
CCY, but an MRI is recommended to further characterize

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- check hemoglobin ___ or ___ with INR to decide whether 
warfarin can be restarted
- f/u incidental clavicle finding with repeat CXR
- f/u incidental liver finding with MRI of liver

Greater than 30 minutes spent on discharge related activities.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Why were you admitted?
- you were admitted due to bleeding in the abdominal muscle 
(rectus muscle) from excessive coughing and thinned blood from 
Coumadin

What was done for you in the hospital?
- your blood counts (hemoglobin) were monitored over 48 hours 
and remained stable
- your Coumadin was stopped for now to allow for the area to 
heal

What will you need to do when you go home?
- make an appointment with your PCP ___ cardiologist this 
week and have your hemoglobin and INR checked again to decide 
when it is safe to restart the Coumadin
- discuss with your PCP arranging for ___ non-urgent MRI to look 
at the liver more closely (the CT scan in ___ saw some 
changes which are likely old scars from your gallbladder 
removal, but they recommend an MRI of the liver to look at this 
closer)
- discuss with your PCP to repeat an x-ray of the chest - the 
x-ray at ___ saw a "shadowed" area over the clavicle bone 
which is likely just technique of the xray but you should make 
sure that area is otherwise ok
- do NOT take Coumadin until you speak with your PCP ___ 
cardiologist

We wish you the best, 
your ___ team
