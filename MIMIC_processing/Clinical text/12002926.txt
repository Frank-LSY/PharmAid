Imaging:
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 10:52 AM 
1. In the region of the junction of the descending colon and 
sigmoid colon, there is mucosal thickening with pericolonic 
streaky density and a few small air bubbles suggesting 
microperforation.  This is consistent with diverticulitis. There 
is no well-defined mass but re-evaluation with CT or colonoscopy 
after therapy would be recommended to exclude underlying 
malignancy.  There is no gross free air, abscess or obstruction. 

2.  Multiple stable hypodensities are present the liver 
consistent with small cysts. 
3.  The uterus is surgically absent. 
4.  There is a small hiatal hernia. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ presented to ___ holding at ___ on ___ 
for a robotic laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and left 
salpingo-oophorectomy with mobilization of
splenic flexure.
She tolerated the procedure well without complications (Please 
see operative note for further details). After a brief and 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the 
floor for further post-operative management.  
 Neuro: Pain was well controlled on dilaudid PCA. This was 
subsequently transitioned to IV dilaudid and then oxycodone and 
Tylenol once the patient was tolerating PO.  
 CV: Vital signs were routinely monitored during the patient's 
length of stay. She remained hemodynamically stable.  
 Pulm: The patient was encouraged to ambulate, sit and get out 
of bed, use the incentive spirometer, and had oxygen saturation 
levels monitored as indicated.  
 GI: The patient was initially kept NPO after the procedure. She 
was later advanced to and tolerated a regular diet at time of 
discharge. She initially had loose bloody bowel movements that 
subsequently resolved without intervention.   
 GU: Patient had a Foley catheter post-operatively which has 
removed POD1. Urine output was monitored as indicated. At time 
of discharge, the patient was voiding without difficulty.  
 ID: The patient's vital signs were monitored for signs of 
infection and fever. She remained afebrile and required no 
long-term antibiotics. 
 Heme: The patient had blood levels checked post operatively 
during the hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. 
 On ___, the patient was discharged to home. At 
discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet, having normal 
bladder and bowel function, and ambulating independently. She 
will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was
