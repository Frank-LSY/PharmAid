History of Present Illness:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of HTN, HLD,
type 2 non insulin dependent DM, who presents with 1 week 
history
of intermittent vertigo, which worsened this morning. History
provided by patient.

Ms. ___ reports she was in her usual state of health until 6
days ago, on ___, when she developed gradual onset of
generalized malaise, fatigue, and poor PO intake. In this 
context
she had intermittent dizziness that is described as 
room-spinning
vertigo. The vertigo was intermittent, lasting for 10 minutes at
a time.  It occurred ___ times a day over the last 6 days until
this morning.  The vertigo would improve after sitting down and
resting; it was exacerbated by getting up and walking.  The
vertigo was mild in intensity.  She was able to continue working
throughout this time period.

Over the last 6 days, she continued with generalized malaise,
poor p.o. intake and fatigue.  The vertigo remained 
intermittent.
She did have one day when there was no vertigo at all.

Last night, she went to bed at approximately 10 ___.  When she
woke up this morning at 5 AM, she woke up with a severe 
headache.
The headache did wake her up from sleep.  Headache was
holocephalic, sharp in quality, 10 out of 10 in severity.  She
also noticed upon awakening that the room spinning vertigo was
persistent, unlike before when it was intermittent.  It was
present even when lying down.  The only thing that seemed to 
make
it go away was causing her eyes when lying down.  Concerned, she
called an ambulance and came to the emergency department.

While en route to the emergency department, the patient did 
vomit
once in route.  She also vomited a second time upon arriving to
the emergency department.  She did have some chest pain
associated with 1 of the episodes of emesis, which resolved.  
She
received 0.25 mg of lorazepam and IV fluid bolus with some
improvement.  She notes that the headache is now resolved
completely.  The vertigo has also improved, and currently is 
only
present when she gets up to walk; it is not present when lying
supine.

Throughout this time, she denies any other associated symptoms
such as loss of vision, double vision, hearing loss, tinnitus,
focal weakness, numbness or sensory changes.  Apart from her
generalized malaise and poor p.o. intake, no other systemic
symptoms such as fevers/chills or night sweats.

Prior to the above, patient denies any recent triggers or 
changes
to her routine that may have caused this.  Denies any recent
trauma.  Denies any recent new or missed medications.  Reports
that her blood sugars have been well controlled and in the
typical range.

Of note, patient reports that she has had vertigo before.  This
was ___ years ago, when she had intermittent room spinning vertigo
that lasted for ___ minutes at a time.  She does not recall 
the
diagnosis that she was given, but her primary care physician
advised her to do an exercise which led to symptom resolution.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of vascular risk 
factors (HTN, HLD, DM) who presented with 1 week history of 
intermittent room spinning vertigo, which became persistent 
since this morning. Initially in the ER, She had some 
improvement s/p 1L IVF bolus and lying down in ED. On her 
admission exam she has left beating nystagmus persistently on 
primary gaze and in all directions of gaze, worsened on leftward 
gaze. No truncal or appendicular ataxia but she had drift to the 
R and positive unterberger (veering to the R). She could walk 
independently but not in tandem. 

She underwent work-up in the ER notable for CT head and CTA 
head/neck without
evidence of acute process or significant vertebrobasilar 
disease.
She was admitted to the stroke team for rule out of posterior 
circulation stroke though the leading diagnosis was peripheral 
vertigo given the lateralizing signs on examination (R ear 
pathology). 

While admitted to the stroke service, the patient improved 
significantly with IV fluids and anti-emetics. She underwent an 
MRI brain which was negative for any stroke or other acute 
pathology. She was able to ambulate on her own and was 
discharged to home with PCP ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted after you developed symptoms of headache, 
room-spinning/dizziness (called vertigo), and nausea with 
difficulty walking. You were evaluated in the emergency room and 
had a cat scan which did not show any major bleeds or 
abnormalities. You were then admitted to the hospital to the 
neurology stroke team to evaluate for a stroke. You had an MRI 
brain which DID NOT SHOW any stroke or other abnormalities which 
is good news. 

Your symptoms improved drastically overnight and you were able 
to walk on your own. Though you are still having symptoms, we 
suspect that they will improve within the next few days. Most 
likely your vertigo is from an imbalance in the fluid in your 
inner-ear, and will return to normal soon. We recommend that you 
follow-up with your primary care physician this week to ensure 
that you are back to normal. 

Please take all of your medications as prescribed. We have not 
made any changes to your home medications. 

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Neurology Team
