Pertinent Results:

new since the prior exam; this could reflect acute interstitial 
pneumonitis or possibly early failure.  No acute airspace 
disease or effusion.

interstitial pneumonitis or possibly early failure.  Heart is 
mildly enlarged.

VSD/ASD

# Bronchoscopy/BAL (___): P7 L36 M34 E14, Flu PCR, legionella

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ PMHx granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 
anemia, and HLD who presents with worsening DOE x 5 days.

# Dyspnea.
# Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
  Ms. ___ was admitted with DOE and hypoxia with ambulation - 
her O2 sats went as low as 78% with ambulation. There was no 
fevers, chills, cough. CXR showed interstitial prominence and 
Chest CT showed lower lobe predominance GGO.  TTE was 
unremarkable.  Labs were remarkable for elevated ESR 39, CRP 66. 
RF<10, CCP<16, low C-ANCA titers.
   Pulmonary and rheumatology were consulted.  Ultimately the 
decision was to perform a bronch. The Bronch/BAL on ___ 
revealed no clear signs of blood on lavage (making reactivation 
of GPA/Wegener's less likely).  She was empirically treated for 
PJP and placed on high dose Bactrim and steroids.  The 
Bronch/BAL had a cell differential of P7 L36 M34 E14. Flu PCR, 
legionella neg, Fungal, Nocardia, CMV, ___ returned negative.  
However, the DFA for PJP returned positive.  
   As a result, she was given a total 21 day course of high dose 
Bactrim with a steroid taper.  Prilosec, Vit D were also given.  
She will require Bactrim prophylaxis after completion of this 
course.   Due to hypoxia with ambulation, she was also 
discharged home with supplemental O2. 
   In the meantime, Methotrexate was held and will continued to 
be held on discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

   It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you were 
admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia.  You were seen by 
the rheumatologist and pulmonologist, and ultimately underwent a 
bronchoscopy (with alveolar lavage).  This revealed that you had 
Pneumocystis Carinii (jirovecii) infection - which can occur in 
the setting of immunosuppression (from methotrexate, steroids, 
Rituxan).  For this, please complete a Total 21-day treatment 
with Bactrim and steroids (as detailed below).   You will also 
likely require prophylactic doses of Bactrim after this 21-day 
course is completed. 

Please do not take the Methotrexate in the meantime until you 
have your follow up appointment with Dr. ___.

Please use oxygen while ambulating or while active. 

We wish you good health!

Your ___ Team
