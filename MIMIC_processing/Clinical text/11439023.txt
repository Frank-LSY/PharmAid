Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Summary:
==============
Ms ___ is a ___ with h/o HTN who presented 6 days 
after being found to be flu positive with increasing weakness 
and diarrhea as well as several unwitnessed falls and 
"ministrokes." She was monitored on telemetry with no 
arrhythmias noted, although an EKG showed possible atrial 
arrhythmia. She did report dizziness and weakness, and had her 
ears cleaned in-house. ___ was negative, and Epley 
maneuvers were unsuccessful. Trialed on meclizine which did not 
improve her symptoms significantly.

Transitional Issues
=====================
[]Meclizine trialed and only mildly relieved symptoms. Sent home 
on 25mg BID and will require titration or discontinuation on 
outpatient basis. Please consider vestibular ___ in the 
outpatient setting. 
[]If concern for Meniere's disease, please obtain audiometry 
testing.
[]Discharged off of lisinopril. Please consider adding back 
based on outpatient BP reads
[]On 243mg aspirin, likely for TIA history. However, please 
re-evaluate patient and need and dosing for aspirin on 
outpatient basis. 

Acute Issues:
=============
# Vertigo: Ms. ___ has a longstanding history of 
vertigo that she reports has gotten worse over the past 2 
months. She says that she feels profound dizziness throughout 
the day and that this, not a loss of consciousness preceded her 
last fall described below. Unclear whether this represents many 
seconds-long episodes throughout the day such as BPPV or single 
episode, long episode lasting days as in vestibular neuritis. 
Previously complained to PCP of roaring tinnitus consistent with 
Meniere's disease, has never had an audiometry evaluation. On 
exam, prominent right beating nystagmus when patient looks to 
the right, normal head impulse test (no corrective saccade). 
Difficult to assess test of skew due to language barrier. 
Meclizine 25 mg BID was trialed with minimal to moderate relief 
- was discharged with it. Physical therapy performed ___ 
& Epley maneuvers which did not provoke nystagmus and did not 
provide relief. Consider outpatient vestibular ___.

# Unwitnessed fall/Syncope: Occurred ~1 wk prior to admission, 
pt was found unresponsive in "a small corner of her room" per 
patient's daughter. She was found in own stool and urine and 
endorses significant vertigo ("the room was spinning") prior to 
fall. Patient's daughter endorses several similar but less 
dramatic episodes over the past year that she calls "mini 
strokes" where patient will loss consciousness, have garbled 
speech or become incoherent. EKG showing RAA. 1 mm STE in V2, ST 
depressions in V5-V6. QTc 426.  Non-contrast head CT done in ED 
negative for acute hemorrhage or large ischemic stroke but with 
chronic small vessel changes. Blood and urine cultures with no 
growth, low suspicion for infectious cause. She was monitored on 
telemetry with no arrhythmias noted, although an EKG showed 
possible atrial arrhythmia. 

#Cerumen impaction. Ears cleaned in-house.

# Influenza B. Pt with >7 days URI symptoms, was not Tx when 
presented to UC on ___ and FluB+. Pt currently beyond window 
for tx. IVF PRN and PO hydration. Repeat flu swab on ___ 
negative. 

# Urinary Retention. Unclear etiology, has not occurred 
previously, had ___ placed in ED (though was counseled for 
straight cath) w/>1L urine output. UA w/o signs of infxn. Foley 
discontinued and patient did well.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# HTN/CAD: continued home amlodipine, metop. Held home 
lisinopril and aspirin during hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital because of weakness and 
dizziness. You were evaluated by our physical therapists, who 
recommended rehab so that you can get stronger. We trialed a 
medication called meclizine for your dizziness but unfortunately 
this didn't seem to help too much. We monitored your heart on a 
monitor, and your rhythm was reassuring. 

Please follow up with Dr. ___ your complete your stay 
at rehab. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
