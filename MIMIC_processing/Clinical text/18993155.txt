Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male smoker with known 4.5 abdominal 
aortic aneurysm who presented with abdominal pain who was 
admitted to the ___ on 
___. The patient was taken to the endovascular suite and 
underwent  now status post endovascular aortic aneurysm repair 
complicated by Type II vs III vs IV endoleak. For details of the 
procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient 
tolerated the procedure well without complications and was 
brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. 
After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to the vascular 
surgery floor where he remained through the rest of the 
hospitalization. 

Post-operatively, he did well without any groin swelling. He was 
able to tolerate a regular diet, get out of bed and ambulate 
without assistance, void without issues, and pain was controlled 
on oral medications alone. A repeat CTA showed no definite 
evidence of endoleak. Of note, it showed a 1.2cm right adrenal 
nodule, for which dedicated adrenal CT is recommended in 6 
months, which was communicated to the patient and his PCP. He 
was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate 
discharge and follow-up instructions.
