Cardiac stress nuclear test
FINDINGS:  
  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast 
attenuation.   
  
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.   
  
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the 
left ventricular myocardium.  
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 81% with an 
EDV of 55 ml.  
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 
  
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.   
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Atypical chest Pain
PW intermittent atypical CP with mildly elevated troponin c/f
NSTEMI. EKG w/o ischemic changes. Troponin downtrended 0.03 --> 
0.02. Given initial ASA 324mg and CW asa 81mg. Heparin was 
deferred. Stress nuclear test showed normal myocardial 
perfusion, not c/w ischemic event. Atypical CP most likely due 
to costochondritis with reproducible CP on palpation. No PE on 
CTA.

# Pleural Effusion: CTA showed trace L pleural effusion w/
atelectasis; however, no acute need for work up, consider follow 
up imaging.

# Thyroid Nodule: No indication for follow up imaging per 
radiology

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
# HLD:Continued home simvastatin 20 mg QPM
# MS: In remission, diagnosed ___ iso optic neuritis 

Transitional Issues:
[] Consider follow-up imaging for trace pleural effusion noted 
on ___ CTA
