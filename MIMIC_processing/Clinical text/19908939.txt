Brief Hospital Course:
Legal: ___
Psychiatric:
While in the ED, patient appeared irritable, guarded, paranoid, 
and was noted to respond to internal stimuli. He became agitated 
but was verbally redirectible and agreeable to taking a total of 
Haldol 5mg and Ativan 1.5mg over the course of 24 hours. He 
slept quietly for most of the night and following day. Tox 
screens were notably negative. Upon arrival to Deac 4, patient 
was calmer and more organized. When asked, he continued to state 
his belief that his penis might be shrinking, though he was less 
distressed by this concern. He remained vague and sometimes 
inconsistent in his responses, but did state repeatedly that 
being hospitalized was a "misunderstanding" because he had just 
wanted an "evaluation" for his penis and headache. 

Due to concerns for psychosis with rapid improvement on low-dose 
Haldol, patient was written for Haldol 2 mg PO bid, though this 
was repeatedly refused by patient. He was subsequently observed 
to be grossly organized, with no overt paranoid or delusional 
thinking, and no unsafe or aggressive behaviors at any point. He 
was mildly irritable, denied any AVH/CAH with some evidence of 
possible self-dialoging, but remained in good behavioral control 
throughout.

Medical:
There were no acute medical issues during patientÂ’s hospital 
stay. Vital signs were monitored routinely and found to be 
within normal range.
 
Social/Milieu:
Patient was visible on the unit. He had limited group 
participation but met with his treatment team daily. He was 
maintained on q15 minute checks with no unsafe or aggressive 
behaviors.
  
Risk Assessment: 
Due to his likely psychosis with concerns for early 
schizophrenia, along with his lack of outpatient mental health 
treaters, patient is at elevated risk for self-harm, harm to 
others, and impaired judgment with future inability to care for 
self. However, patient was observed to be grossly organized 
during his hospitalization, after brief treatment with low-dose 
Haldol, and currently does not appear to be at acute risk. 
Future risk has been decreased through referral to future 
outpatient mental health treatment. Patient declines psychopharm 
treatment.

Dispo: 
Prior to discharge, social worker met with both patient and 
mother, who notably arrived several hours late for the meeting 
and was quite agitated during most of the conversation. She had 
difficulty focusing on questions posed and was mostly angry at 
her son whom she felt was argumentative towards her. She 
reported no acute safety concerns, no concerns about patient's 
ability to function at home, and no objections to his return 
home with her. Patient also continued to deny any concerns, with 
no interest in medications at this time. He was subsequently 
discharged home to the care of his mother with scheduled follow 
up with his PCP, with recommendation for subsequent mental 
health follow up.
