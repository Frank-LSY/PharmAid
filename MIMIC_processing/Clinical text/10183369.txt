Physical Exam:
Expired. 
 
Pertinent Results:
CT C-spine (___): 

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of fracture or malalignment of the cervical 
spine. No evidence of hemorrhage. 
2. Partially visualized right apical pneumothorax. 
3. Left first right second, and right third posterior fractures 
better 
described on dedicated CT torso from same day. 

CT Torso (___): 

IMPRESSION: 

1. Intermediate density surrounding the descending aorta 
consistent with 
mediastinal hematoma of uncertain source. No evidence of acute 
aortic 
abnormality. 
2. Moderate non tension right pneumothorax. 
3. Multilevel lumbar spinal and rib fractures as described 
above. Right 
nondisplaced sacral fracture. 
4. Scattered lung contusions. Right posterior lobe lobar 
atelectasis. Mild 
left posterior lobe atelectasis. 
5. No direct intra-abdominal or intrapelvic organ injury or 
hematoma. 
6. Bilateral gluteal hyperdensity, left greater than right may 
be active 
extravasation. 

CT Head (___): 

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Diffuse global cerebral edema with 5 mm leftward midline 
shift. 
2. Right parietal and left parietal occipital skull fractures 
with possible extension to the left occipital mastoid suture. 
3. Subcutaneous emphysema may be due to occult fracture of the 
left mastoid air cells or intubation status. 
4. Scattered foci of small subarachnoid/intraparenchymal 
hemorrhages. 

CXR (___): 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Bilateral chest tubes, ETT and right femoral catheter are in 
appropriate position. 
2. No evidence of acute fracture. 
3. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the trauma bay on ___ after being 
struck by a train. He was intubated at scene as his GCS was 3. 
Upon primary survey, patient's airway was protected with 
intubation. Bilateral breath sounds were heard but crackles were 
heard and so bilateral chest tubes were placed at the trauma bay 
with some sanguinous return. This was put to suction. There were 
multiple large degloving injuries of the scalp and left open 
tib/fib fracture with hemorrhage. The lacerations were repaired 
at scene and LLE was Ace wrapped. MTP was initiated. Patient 
initially had a cardiac arrest upon initial arrival at the 
trauma bay. He had a return of pulse and was sent to CT for pan 
scan. His head CT was noted for diffuse brain edema, multiple 
skull fractures, lumbar spinal fractures and fluid collections 
around the aorta without obvious aortic injuries on wet read. 
Upon return to the trauma bay, the patient coded again and CPR 
was initiated with return of pulse again. He was transferred 
emergently to the TSICU after stabilization. In the TSICU, 
patient had persistent transfusion requirement and pressor 
requirement. He had progressively increasing ventilator 
requirements and worsening acidosis.  Given patient's 
unsurvivable brain injuries and worsening overall picture, 
further efforts at resuscitation were determined to be futile. 
No further resuscitation efforts were undertaken and patient 
expired at ___. Next of kin (mother) was notified and the 
medical examiner was called and accepted the case.
