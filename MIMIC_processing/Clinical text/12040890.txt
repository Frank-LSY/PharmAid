Brief Hospital Course:
On admission:
___ w/ h/o uncomplicated diverticulitis in ___ that failed 
cipro+flagyl treatment, resolved on unasyn; mitral valve 
prolapse; DVT in her ___ while on oral contraceptives; possible 
anticardiolipin antibodies; who presented w/ 1 week of 
progressive abdominal pain and found to have uncomplicated 
diverticulitis, course complicated by worsening of symptoms at 
home after discharge from ED, leading to admission. Repeat CT 
abdomen again demonstrated uncomplicated diverticulitis. IV 
zosyn initiated on admission ___ midnight as patient could 
not tolerate PO meds and had developed nausea vomiting. 

Acute medical issues addressed:

Uncomplicated Diverticulitis
Patient with h/o of uncomplicated diverticulitis in ___ that 
failed cipro/flagyl and resolved while on unasyn, admitted on IV 
zosyn. Over the course of stay, patient had one fever (101.5) 
early morning of ___, after which her vitals remained stable 
and afebrile throughout her stay with systolic BPs elevating to 
150s in episodes of pain. Patient began to tolerate PO liquids 
on ___ and PO solids on ___, at which point she was 
transitioned from zosyn to augmentin. Patient was never found to 
have leukocytosis, and has had resolution of abdominal pain. She 
developed diarrhea the night of ___ with new gassy pain that 
is distinctly different from the diverticulitis pain she 
experienced before, likely due to a combination of bowel regimen 
and augmentin. Patient's stool was analyzed to rule out C. diff; 
and was found to be negative. 
Chronic medical issues addressed:

Mitral Valve Prolapse
Patient continued use of aspirin 162mg daily, per prior home 
regimen.

Remote h/o DVT#h/o DVT ___ yrs ago
DVT occurred while patient was on ___ of oral contraception 
in her mid-20s and after striking her leg forcefully against a 
car. She also reported possible anticardiolipin antibody 
syndrome off anticoagulation. In hospital, she received: Heparin 
5000 Unit SC BID, her home aspirin, and we discussed a follow up 
visit w/ hematology to reassess her status.

Transitional Issues:
- C. diff assay pending ___: RETURNED NEGATIVE, PATIENT 
INFORMED AND PRESCRIBED IMODIUM 
- 10 day course of Augmentin to end on ___ 
- patient should follow up w/ a colonoscopy at 6wks after 
resolution to rule out malignancy
- watch for danger signs
- watch for worsening of diarrhea if probiotics and conclusion 
of augmentin regimen does not lead to improvement
- follow up with hematologist to reassess anticardiolipin 
antibody status

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you this week, though we know a 
stay in the hospital is rarely itself a highlight. Thank you for 
coming in to get the right treatment. We're glad the 
diverticulitis is responding to the antibiotics and are sending 
you home in a stable state of recovery. The diarrhea may persist 
with the use of augmentin, but if anything changes (dramatically 
different pain, odor) please be in touch with your PCP.

As for your time with us, you came to ___ on ___ 
after a week of progressive abdominal pain that got to the point 
of rigor-inducing spasms. You spoke with your PCP over the 
weekend who initiated a course of oral antibiotics ___ 
morning (___) and recommended that you head to the ED for 
evaluation. CT imaging of your abdomen that day show 
uncomplicated diverticulitis, which means there were no 
perforations, obstructions, abscess, or fistulas. You were sent 
home on oral antibiotics since uncomplicated diverticulitis 
typically resolves with home-based care. Unfortunately, as you 
know, your symptoms worsened over ___ and ___. 
Specifically, you developed nausea and vomiting along with the 
inability to hold down food and meds taken by mouth. 

Once you arrived on ___, you were admitted and 
switched to IV antibiotics, ultimately on IV Zosyn, since meds 
by mouth ("PO") were not an option at the time. A repeat CT 
imaging study of your abdomen again confirmed a diagnosis of 
uncomplicated diverticulitis, so there was no pressing need to 
consider surgery to treat the infection. Your nausea gradually 
subsided, perhaps because you were on a medicine called 
ondansetron for nausea or possibly due to the IV antibiotics 
(Zosyn) beginning to have the desired therapeutic effect. We 
continued the Zosyn for a full day as you regained the ability 
to eat a regular meal. Over ___, you added liquids and 
started to take some of your routine medicines by mouth. By 
___ afternoon, you were starting to eat solid foods. We 
transitioned you off the IV Zosyn to oral Augmentin on ___ 
(___) as you were 1)improving symptomatically and 2)able to 
handle medicines by mouth.

Over the evening from ___ into ___, you developed watery 
diarrhea. This is likely a side-effect of the augmentin; the 
diarrhea may have also been helped by a combination of events: 
you had your first bowel movement in five to six days the 
morning of ___, you received several doses of a regimen that 
increases bowel motility, and you started eating solids all at 
the same time as when you began the augmenting. Today, ___, we 
sent for stool analysis to rule out the possibility of C. diff, 
a bug that can infect folks who've been on antibiotics, 
particularly flagyl. The result is still pending at the time of 
discharge.

Going forward at home:

1) You should continue the augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanic 
acid) 850mg every 12 hours for 7 more days to complete a total 
of 10 days. You last dose should be on the evening of ___, 
___. Please feel free to take probiotics, especially if 
diarrhea persists with the augmentin. "Align" brand is 
well-studied, though it is more expensive as a brand-name 
product.

2) We will call you with the results of the C. difficile test 
when it becomes available. If it is positive, we will discuss 
starting appropriate therapy and deliver a prescription to your 
pharmacy. If it is negative, we will send a prescription for an 
anti-diarrheal medication. 

3) At six weeks after you recover, we strongly recommend that 
you have a colonoscopy to rule out the remote possibility of 
malignancy in the colon. This is the standard recommendation for 
all cases of diverticulitis, as the imaging and symptoms during 
an acute flair can inhibit the ability to rule out malignancy. 

4) Continue to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed for pain; 
make sure to space doses out by at least 6 hours. You may take 
up to 650mg at each dose. 

5) We encourage you to follow-up with a hematologist to reassess 
your anticardiolipin antibody status along with the TIA's you 
mentioned. 

6) Please follow-up with your PCP so that he may learn about 
your experience and help continue to manage your mitral valve 
prolapse.

Please feel free to be in touch with any questions!
