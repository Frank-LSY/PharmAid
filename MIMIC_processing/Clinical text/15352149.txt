Plan:  The patient was seen and evaluated by myself and Dr.
___ at today's visit.  She does have an unstable ankle
fracture that requires operative intervention.  We discussed 
with
the patient that we would perform open reduction internal
fixation of left ankle fracture.  

Risks and benefits of the proposed surgery were discussed in
detail with the patient. We discussed both non-operative as well
as operative treatments.  Risk of the surgery include, but are
not limited to, infection, bleeding and injury to arteries and
veins, wound complications, injury to nerves and tendons,
neuroma, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, reflex
sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome, failure
to return to previous athletic level, need for additional
procedures and even the remote risk of catastrophic 
complications
such as loss of limb, heart attack, stroke and/or loss of life.
Specific to bony surgeries such as fusions and fractures there 
is
additional risk of ___ or ___, recurrence of
deformity and prominent hardware which may require removal in 
the
future. For soft tissue procedures there is also a risk of
re-injury or re-rupture of repaired ligaments and tendons.  

In the interim, we have placed the patient in an AO splint.  She
was provided with a script for home services to help her with
ADLs, as she lives alone.  Additionally, I have provided her 
with
a small pain medication refill, given the severity of her pain. 
We have reached out to our administrative staff to help
facilitate the booking of her surgery.  We will likely contact
the patient in one to two days with an operative date and time.

Exam: Tenderness to palpation in the left lateral ankle. Edema. 
Reduced range of motion.
Impression: Left ankle fracture with widening of the ankle
mortise.
Plan: ORIF left ankle fracture

or ___, PA-C will address any questions or 
concerns you may have. If this is an urgent matter at night or

Prescription refills or changes cannot be addressed after normal 
business hours or on weekends.

PAIN CONTROL:

-You may or may not have had a nerve block depending on the 
type of surgery. This will likely wear off later in the evening 
and it is normal to have increased pain when the nerve block 
wears off. Please take your prescribed pain medications as 
directed with food prior to the nerve block wearing off. 
-Stay ahead of the pain!
-Narcotic pain medications can cause constipation. Please take 
a stool softener while taking these and drink plenty of water.
-Please plan ahead! If you are running out of your medication 
prior to your follow-up appointment please call during business 
hours with a ___ day notice. Prescription refills or changes 
cannot be addressed after normal business hours or on weekends.

NON-NARCOTIC PAIN CONTROL

-Multi-modal pain control is critical. If you are able to take 
Tylenol (acetaminophen) I would strongly encourage you to do so 
according to the instructions on the bottle. Do not take more 
than 4,000 mg of Tylenol in 24 hours.
-NSAIDs (Advil, Motrin, Aleve, etc) are also excellent for pain 
control post-operatively. Do not take if you have had a bone 
fusion surgery, but for soft tissue procedures or most fracture 
surgeries these medications are acceptable unless you are unable 
to take for other medical reasons or unless we have specifically 
instructed you against it.
-Elevation with the operative site above the level of the heart 
will decrease swelling and improve pain control
-Ice or cold therapy may also be helpful. Do not keep ice or 
cold directly on the skin and do not use for more than ___ 
minutes to decrease risk of skin injury from the cold. Do NOT 
use ice when the block is still in effect as you will not know 
if you are injuring yourself. You may place the ice pack behind 
your knee if you have a bulky dressing on your foot. 
-Every little bit helps. The faster you can come off the 
narcotic medication the better. Most of my patients do not need 
narcotics after the first post-operative visit!

ACTIVITY:

-You will likely have swelling after surgery. Please keep the 
foot elevated on ___ pillows at all times possible. You can 
apply a dry, covered, ice-bag on top of your dressing or behind 
your knee for 20 minutes at a time as often as you like.
-Unless instructed otherwise you should not put any weight down 
on your operated extremity until you come back for your first 
postoperative visit.

CARE FOR YOUR DRESSING:

-You should not remove your dressing. I will do so when I see 
you for your first post-operative visit.
-It is not unusual to have a little bloody staining through 
your dressing. However please call the office for any concerns.

PREVENTION OF BLOOD CLOTS:

-You have been instructed to take medication in order to help 
prevent blood clots after surgery. Please take an aspirin 325 mg 
every day unless you have been specifically prescribed a 
different medication by me. If there is some reason why you 
cannot take aspirin please notify my office.
