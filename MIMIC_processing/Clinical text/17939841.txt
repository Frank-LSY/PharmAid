Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
repair of your paraesophageal hernia. You had a laparoscopic 
repair of your paraesophageal hernia with Nissen fundoplication 
without complications. You tolerated the procedure well and are 
now ambulating, voiding, tolerating a regular diet, and your 
pain is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are now 
ready to be discharged to home. Please follow the 
recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for 
pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 
3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery 
but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you 
are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take 
the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the 
Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to 
help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean 
off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

Additional: 
- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back
- urinary:  burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal: outer dressing can be removed on ___
-You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering 
your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. Do not remove steri-strips (thin paper strips 
covering incisions)--they will fall off by themselves in ___ 
weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and the edges are 
curling up, you may carefully peel them off. 

Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 

-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. 

Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities. 

- Your ___ Care Team
