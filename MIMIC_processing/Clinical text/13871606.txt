Chief Complaint:

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old R-handed male with hx of colon cancer 
inremission, HTN, remote smoking who presents with left arm and 
leg weakness. 
.
Pt was in normal state of health until ___ AM when he awoke at
11AM in the morning and felt that both of his legs and to a
lesser degree, his left arm felt weak and numb. The weakness was
more pronounced than the sensation of numbness. He was able to
get up and walk around the house without much difficulty and as
he did so, the right leg symptoms completely resolved but his
left sided symptoms remained. He was able to walk stairs with
mild difficulty and was able to go to work where he is a
___. At around 1pm when he was massaging he felt an 
increase
in the weakness in his left arm. He has not dropped any objects,
fallen, or had any real functional impairment due to his 
weakness
aside from some mild difficulty with walking. Denies any facial
weakness or droop. 
.
His daughter called his PCP ___ AM who told them to go to the ED
immediately and they arrived at 3pm. In the ED, due to initially
endorsing b/l ___ weakness, and his history of colon cancer, MRI
C/T/L spine were done to rule out spinal process - these did not
show any signs of compression. 
.
He does note that he is, at baseline, stronger in his right arm
than his left and usually does most of his work with his right
hand, holding his left arm flexed during work. This has been the
case for several years but he does feel a change in his strength
in his arm on this presentation.  
.
On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, hearing difficulty, incoordination. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies parasthesiaes. No
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. He does note at
baseline that after voiding urine, he will sometimes leak a 
small
amount. 
.
On general review of systems, he endorses generalized fatigue,
decreased appetite, and mild cough due to dry air in ED. No 
fever
or chills.  Denies shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or
tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain. No dysuria.

Retinal Detachment in ___ R greater than L requiring corrective
surgery
Cataract surgery in ___
Glaucoma
HTN

IMAGING RESULTS
==============================
MRI ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Right basal gangliar acute infarction. 
2. Areas of subacute infarction within the left centrum 
semiovale. 
3. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic changes. 
4. No evidence for intracranial metastatic disease. 
.
CTA Head/Neck ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality without evidence of 
infarct, hemorrhage,
or mass effect.
2. Nonspecific periventricular and deep white matter hypodensity 
likely
secondary to sequela chronic microangiopathy.
3. Hypoplastic maxillary sinuses which demonstrate 
mild-to-moderate mucosal
thickening.
4. Patent intracranial and neck vasculature without occlusion, 
dissection, or
aneurysm.  Mild stenosis at the origin of the bilateral 
vertebral arteries.
.
ECHO ___:
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified. Preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No 
significant valvular abnormality seen. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of colon cancer, HTN, remote smoker, here with 
weakness and mild sensory change in left arm and leg. His exam 
is significant for mild upper motor neuron pattern weakness in 
left leg more than arm, possible mild proprioceptive impairment 
on the left. Imaging demonstrated partial right anterior 
choroidal artery stroke, most likely due to intrinsic 
atherosclerotic disease. He did not have any cardiac arrhythmia 
and ECHO did not show any evidence for PFO or any thrombus 
formation.

His home anti-hypertensives were restarted, as well as ASA 81mg 
qday and atorvastatin 10mg qday.

He had ___ assessment and was found to be safe with regard to his 
walking. He will be discharged home today with outpatient 
physical therapy. His lipid panel is pending at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left arm and leg 
weakness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors where possible.

Your risk factors are:  
- history of smoking
- possibly high cholesterol, the tests have not come back prior 
to your discharge
- high blood pressure

We are changing your medications as follows:  
START ASPIRIN 81mg EVERY DAY
START ATORVASTATIN 10mg EVERY DAY
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:

- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

We wish you a speedy recovery,
Your ___ Neurology Team
