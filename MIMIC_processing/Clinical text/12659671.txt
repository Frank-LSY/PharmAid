symptoms after revealing 3 suicide attempts in the ___ period 
prior to admission to his psychiatrist at ___

difficulty filling his fluoxetine and bupropion prescriptions 
prior to his SA's and identified this as a contributing factor.  
As per patient's report, these attempts include briefly 
attempting to hang himself, attempting overdose on codeine and 
alcohol, and attempting to overdose on a "month's supply" of 
fluoxetine and bupropion. He did not disclose to his family, 
romantic partner, or psychiatric provider his emerging suicidal 
ideation prior to these attempt and waited over a week to 
disclose these attempts to his outpatient psychiatrist (who was 
also the moonlighting psychiatrist on our inpatient unit, and 
saw the patient in person in the capacity on ___. The 
patient was admitted and started on lithium for mood lability 
and antisuicidal properties, and reported improvement on it in 
his mood stability and improving depression. He was also 
restarted on bupropion given success on it in the past as per 
the patient and his outpatient psychiatrist. The patient was 
also started on quetiapine, due to reports of poor sleep and 
reports of auditory hallucinations which began in the second

preoccupation, thought disorder, or psychotic or delusional 
thinking. 

The patient reported benefiting from his time on the unit and

individual therapy that would allow him to better cope with 
negative feelings, he also felt more comfortable seeking help 
and more comfortable in feeling he deserved help if he felt 
unsafe. He stated that he would share with his girlfriend, 
family, and outpatient providers if he felt unsafe going 
forward. He identified life stressors that might predispose him 
towards SI, such as difficulties in school, and elected to take 
a leave of absence upon discharge in order to focus on mental 
health and participate in PHP and outpatient treatment. Losing 
his student status and thus student housing an access to ___ 
psychiatry services was also a stressor, but he was able to 
arrange for moving in with his girlfriend upon discharge and was

up. He denies SI, HI, AVH a time of discharge, was future 
oriented, feeling positive about discharge and planning for 
outpatient follow up.
