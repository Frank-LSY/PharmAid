Chief Complaint:
Right intraparenchymal hemorrhage
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and terminal extubation
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with PMHx significant for life long smoking, dementia, and

taken
to ___ were SBPs were in the 190s (193/80->190/70) and
INR=0.89. ___ showed large IPH. She was started on a
nicardipine gtt and given mannitol 25g. She was sent to ___ 
via
medflight. On arrival, she was given another 25g mannitol. 
Neurosurgery evaluated her and determined that no surgical
intervention was indicated. Prior to this, she was not
complaining of a headache and has had no recent traumas. She has
never been diagnosed with or treated for HTN. Neurology was
consulted for management recommendations.

IMAGING: 
- NCHCT ___: 
There is massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring
approximately 6.8 x 9.6 x 8.1 cm centered at the right
parietooccipital lobe with a layering hematocrit level.  There 
is
also a focus of intraparenchymal blood in the right frontal 
lobe.
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage is also identified. 
There is also blood within the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
There is extensive mass effect causing subfalcine herniation 
with
2.3 cm leftward shift of normal midline structures.  Downward
transtentorial herniation with complete effacement of the basal
cisterns with mass effect on the midbrain is present.  There is
entrapment of the left lateral ventricle with dilatation of the
left lateral ventricle and in particular, the temporal horn. 
Overall degree of hemorrhage and mass effect is not 
significantly
changed compared to the outside study performed two hours prior.
There is no evidence of fracture.  The visualized portion of the
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities 
are
clear.  The visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable. 
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the carotid siphons are noted.
IMPRESSION: Massive right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with extensive mass effect with subfalcine and
downward transtentorial herniation and entrapment of the left
ventricle.  Small amount of intraventricular and subarachnoid
blood also present. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx significant for life long smoking, dementia, and
melanoma who was found to have a massive intraparenchymal
hemorrhage on ___ after being found down at home. CT showed a
massive right parietal-occipital bleed as well as a small 
frontal
bleed as well as evidence of blood products of different ages. 
Admission exam was notable for fix dilated pupils, slight
corneals R>L, posturing with nasal tickle, no cough with 
suction,
no gag with dental sponge, BUE extensor posturing, BLE triple
flexion, toes up bilaterally.  No surgical intervention was 
offered and her prognosis is grim. Per her son, she previously 
voiced her wishes for DNR/DNI and this was reiterated by her PCP 
during transport to ___. She will be made
DNR on admission. She was terminally extubated ___ and 
passed away at 9:55pm with family at bedside.
