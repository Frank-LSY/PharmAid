History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ right handed man with a history of
oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, HLD, and HTN who was 
referred
to the ED for stroke workup after multiple left cerebellar
infarcts were discovered on an outpatient brain MRI.

He was driving his scooter by the lake on ___ ___ when he
lost control of his scooter and drove down a ramp into the lake.
He describes that he was aware throughout the incident with no
LOC. He's not quite sure what happened, but thinks he had 
trouble
with the controls and drove into the lake. His wife witnessed 
the
event from a distance and saw no seizure activity or anything
else abnormal. She went to help him and he was startled by the
cold water and in this setting seemed a little confused, but
otherwise at baseline. She looked for signs of a stroke and 
found
none. The scooter was still functional and he was able to
continue riding it just fine. He denied having trouble with
coordination, vision, dizziness, or any other new symptoms. He
has used this scooter for a long time. It is controlled by using
hand controller with both hands. He is not sure what happened to
cause him to drive into the lake. His wife is concerned that me
has been having some mild confusion lately. He saw his PCP later
in the week who ordered a brain MRI for possible syncope workup
which showed several subacute infarcts in the left cerebellum,
prompting referral to the ED. He currently feels at his baseline
with no new complaints. 
 
 
Review of Systems: positive for chronic BLE edema, skin changes
in legs. He has chronic leg weakness, dysphagia, and ptosis. The

RECOMMENDATION(S): 5 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule. As 
per the

follow-up at 12 
months is recommended and if no change, no further imaging 
needed. For high 
risk patients, initial follow-up CT at ___ months and then at

Echo ___
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, 
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

 IMPRESSION: No ASD or PFO seen. Normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Posterior MVP with mild mitral 
regurgitation.    

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted after cerebellar strokes identified on 
ambulatory scan for stroke work-up.

A1C 4.9. LDL 108 and his home simvastatin 20mg was increased to 
atorvastatin 20mg daily (to monitor for elevated CKs in setting 
of higher statin). Echocardiogram without PFO, EF >55%. 

He did have elevated troponins and CK-MB with normal serial 
EKGs. Troponin peaked on ___ at 0.04 and downtrended to 0.02. 
CK was elevated given muscular dystrophy to 350-450. CK-MB ___ 
during admission with normal MIB index. This was thought to be 
most likely due to his muscular dystrophy. He was asymptomatic 
and thought not to be of clinically significant cardiac 
etiology. 

He was monitored on telemetry without arrhythmia, and will be 
discharged on ___ of Hearts monitor. 

He was evaluated by ___ who recommended discharge to home with 
home ___. He was evaluated by speech who felt he could continue 
regular diet. 

He was continued on his home blood pressure medication losartan 
50mg-HCTZ12.5mg daily. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. CTA noted 2 mm aneurysm in L M1 that will be followed by 
neurology. No other work-up indicated at this time given small 
size in the anterior circulation.
2. 5mm RUL nodule detected, recommend follow-up scan in ___ 
months by PCP.
3. Of note, he did have an elevated troponin that downtrended 
with normal EKGs, asymptomatic and elevated CK in the setting of 
muscular dystrophy. Please evaluate should he become 
symptomatic, but this was thought to be unlikely of cardiac 
etiology.
