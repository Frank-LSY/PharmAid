Discharge Instructions:
-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to 
possibly experience some urgency and frequency over the next 
month;  this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or 
the indwelling ureteral stent.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter.; This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed. 

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) 

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You

changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.  HOLD ASPIRIN and aspirin containing products for one 
week unless otherwise advised.

-IBUPROFEN (the ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be taken 
even though you may also be taking Tylenol/Acetaminophen. You 
may alternate these medications for pain control. For pain 
control, try TYLENOL FIRST, then ibuprofen, and then take the 
narcotic pain medication as prescribed if additional pain relief 
is needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)

-You MAY be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM 
that will help with the "burning" pain you may experience when 
voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.
