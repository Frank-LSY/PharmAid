Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o HTN, back pain, hypothyroidism who presents with altered 
mental status.

# Altered mental status 
# Weakness
-Her presentation is consistent with catatonia. Psychiatry and 
neurology saw the patient as well. Outside records were obtained 
which indicated that she has a history of depression with 
psychotic features, and had been put on fluphenazine which may 
have been causing some parkinsonism. When she first presented, 
her encephalopathy/AMS may have been related to polypharmacy; 
she does not know all of her medications and the patient's 
family reports she has a bag of medications that is not 
consistent with her meds list. It is unclear if she had excess 
sedating or interacting medications in her body that cleared but 
this is likely what triggered her presentation. She recently 
relocated from ___ to ___ as her grandson did not feel she was 
improving. There was concern that a spinal injection ___ 
may have caused some trauma/injury to the back and caused an 
encephalitis like picture but she remained afebrile/no wbc count 
and had no signs or symptoms of infection, and her mentation 
improved with cessation of narcotics and anti psychotics.

and has done very well on this regimen which is what she should 
stay on

arranged. They are talking about relocating her permanently to
