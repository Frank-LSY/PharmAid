IMAGING
================================
CXR ___:

___. 
Borderline cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old F w/ Alzheimer's dementia who was 
found down at her nursing home after an unwitnessed fall where 
she hit the back of her head while walking across the dining 
room, found to have a subdural hematoma, not planned for 
surgical intervention based on GOC. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[] Patient largely normotensive during admission. Recommend SBP 
<160 for subdural hemorrhage. 
[] Keppra should continue for 7 days, final day ___.
[] Consider taper of sertraline over ___ weeks given unclear 
benefit with advanced dementia.
[] Would recommend continuing discussions around transition to 
hospice care. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
==================
# Subdural hemorrhage 
CT head showing left mixed density holohemispheric SDH, max 
thickness 1cm with 7mm of midline shift. Neurosurgery was 
consulted, but family opted for non-surgical management at this 
time given advanced dementia. Neuro exam limited by cooperation, 
but overall remained ___, with improving alertness throughout 
admission. Patient was started on a course of keppra for a 7 day 
course for seizure prophylaxis. 

# Recurrent falls
# Dementia
# Acute encephalopathy
Patient with three falls in two days prior to admission. Likely 
mechanical in setting of confusion, dementia; per sister (HCP),
patient sometimes ambulates at facility without her walker (e.g. 
at night, for unclear reasons), and this is when falls occur.
Likely also some component of dehydration, poor PO intake given 
advanced dementia, elevated BUN on admission. No evidence of 
infection precipitating fall. Telemetry was without events and 
EKG was reassuring. Mental status not significantly different 
than prior per report of sister, though patient was initially 
less interactive likely in the setting of subdural hemorrhage. 
She was cleared for regular diet by speech and swallow therapy.

# Normocytic anemia
Baseline anemia likely in setting of malnutrition and chronic 
disease. Hgb downtrended from 10.9 to 9.1 initially, but then 
rebounded without intervention. 

# Goals of care
Per sister/HCP, does not want anything aggressive given baseline 
dementia. Transition to hospice care may be appropriate pending 
mental status evolution and rehab course. DNR/DNI code status 
was confirmed.
