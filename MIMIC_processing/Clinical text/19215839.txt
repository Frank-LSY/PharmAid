Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
left partial
nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; 
please see dictated operative note for details. In the PACU she 
complained of blurred vision and pain at her left eye. The 
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient 
ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, drain and urethral 
Foley catheter were removed without difficulty and diet was 
advanced as tolerated. She was evaluated for corneal abrasion by 
our colleagues in ophthalmology. The remainder of the hospital 
course was relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged 
in stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, 
voiding without difficulty, and with pain control on oral 
analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with 
no evidence of hematoma collection or infection. The patient was 
given explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic in 
approximately four weeks time.

Discharge Instructions:
Please also refer to the provided handout that details 
instructions and expectations for your post-operative phase as 
made available by your urologist. 

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications except as noted. 
ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication changes 
and your post-operative course with your primary care doctor.

-___ reduce the strain/pressure on your abdomen and incision 
sites; remember to log roll onto your side and then use your 
hands to push yourself upright while taking advantage of the 
momentum of putting your legs/feet to the ground.

--There may be bandage strips called steristrips which have 
been applied to reinforce wound closure. Allow these bandage 
strips to fall off on their own over time but PLEASE REMOVE ANY 
REMAINING GAUZE DRESSINGS WITHIN 2 DAYS OF DISCHARGE. You may 
get the steristrips wet.

-UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED; AVOID aspirin or aspirin containing 
products and supplements that may have blood-thinning effects 
(like Fish Oil, Vitamin E, etc.). This will be noted in your 
medication reconciliation. 

IF PRESCRIBED (see the MEDICATION RECONCILIATION):
-IBUPROFEN (the ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be taken 
even though you may also be taking Tylenol/Acetaminophen. You 
may alternate these medications for pain control. 

For pain control, try TYLENOL (acetaminophen) FIRST, then 
ibuprofen, and then take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)

-Call your Urologist's office to schedule/confirm your follow-up 
appointment in 4 weeks AND if you have any questions.

-Do not eat constipating foods for ___ weeks, drink plenty of 
fluids to keep hydrated

-No vigorous physical activity or sports for 4 weeks or until 
otherwise advised. Light household chores/activity and leisurely 
walking/activity is OK and should be continued. Do NOT be a 
couch potato

-Tylenol should be your first-line pain medication. A narcotic 
pain medication has been prescribed for breakthrough pain ___.

-Max daily Tylenol (acetaminophen) dose is THREE to FOUR grams 
from ALL sources

 AVOID lifting/pushing/pulling items heavier than 10 pounds (or 
3 kilos; about a gallon of milk) or participate in high 
intensity physical activity (which includes intercourse) until 
you are cleared by your Urologist in follow-up.

-No DRIVING for THREE WEEKS or until you are cleared by your 
Urologist

-You may shower normally but do NOT immerse your incisions or 
bathe

-Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do not 
operate dangerous machinery

-You may be given prescriptions for a stool softener ___ a 
gentle laxative. These are over-the-counter medications that may 
be health care spending account reimbursable. 

-Colace (docusate sodium) may have been prescribed to avoid 
post-surgical constipation or constipation related to use of 
narcotic pain medications. Discontinue if loose stool or 
diarrhea develops. Colace is a stool-softener, NOT a laxative.

-Senokot (or any gentle laxative) may have been prescribed to 
further minimize your risk of constipation. 

-If you have fevers > 101.5 F, vomiting, or increased redness, 
swelling, or discharge from your incision, call your doctor or 
go to the nearest emergency room
