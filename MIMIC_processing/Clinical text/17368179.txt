sided "heavyness" and weakness. the pt denies loss of vision,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted for weakness in your right arm and leg 
resulting from an acute ischemic stroke. You had imaging of your 
brain with CT and MRI which confirmed these findings. Stroke is 
a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors.  Your risk factors are Lupus and high blood pressure, 
and high cholesterol. 

You also had imaging of the blood vessels in your brain with CTA 
which showed no acute issues. We have checked an ultrasound of 
your heart which showed no clots or abnormal communication 
between its chambers. To modify your stroke risk factors you 
were started on aspirin 81mg daily and atorvastatin 20mg daily. 
You have been evaluated by physical therapy who recommended you 
continue to have physical therapy service once discharged. You 
will have follow up with your primary care doctor and 
___.

Instructions: 
Please take your other medications as prescribed. 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below. 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms: 
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision 
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth 
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you 
- sudden weakness of one side of the body 
- sudden drooping of one side of the face 
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body 

Sincerely,

Your ___ Neurology Stroke Team
