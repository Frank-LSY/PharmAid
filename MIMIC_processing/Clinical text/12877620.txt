Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the plastic surgery service on 
___ and had a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, sentinel 
lymph node biopsy and immediate bilateral ___ flap breast 
reconstruction. The patient tolerated the procedure well and 
recovered in PACU and transferred to the floor POD1.
. 
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Morphine PCA with 
good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral 
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.  
. 
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored. She was anemic on POD#1 
with Hct 23.0, but asymptomatic so transfusion was held off.
. 
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored. 
. 
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. She was also started on a bowel 
regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on POD#2. 
Intake and output were closely monitored.  
. 
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV cefazolin, 
then switched to PO cefadroxil for discharge home. The patient's 
temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.  
. 
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible.  
.
Chest: Right breast mastectomy flap with mild scattered 
ecchymosis worse on the inferior portion. Left nipple viable, 
right nipple was dusky, ecchymotic with minimal cap refill. ___ 
skin paddles viable bilaterally, with strong doppler signals and 
stable ViOptix. Bilateral breast incisions were intact with no 
evidence of hematoma, and JPX2 with serous fluid draining. Lower 
abdominal incision was C/D/I with JPx2 draining serous fluid.
.
At POD#3, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital 
signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without 
assistance, and pain was well controlled. 

POD#4 No issues overnight. Comfortable this morning with 
adequate pain control. On exam, bilateral reconstructed breasts 
are soft. Mastectomy skin flaps viable with improving 
ecchymosis. Left nipple appears viable, the right appears 
ischemic and continues to demarcate with an area of 
epidermolysis inferiorly. ___ skin paddles soft bilaterally 
with good color and cap refill. Strongly dopplerable arterial 
signals. ViOptix were removed this morning. Abdomen soft, umbo 
viable, lower abdominal incision without erythema or drainage. 
Drain outputs 36/452/93/220- all thin and serosanguinous. Will 
re-apply nitropaste to the right nipple and discharge home today 
on ASA, Duricef and pain meds.
