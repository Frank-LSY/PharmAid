She has not noticed any exacerbation of asthma with NSAIDs. She

Three days prior to admission, Ms. ___ had URI symptoms 
consisting of sore throat, cough, and nasal congestion. She

The patient was seen by ___ urgent care yesterday at 12pm. 
She was given a duoneb in the office with pre peak flow 150 and 
post peak flow 175. She continued to have wheezing on exam with 
HR 140 and was given 125mg IV solumedrol. Patient was then able 
to take a deep breath and peak flow was 225. She was given a 
60mg prednisone taper, albuterol, and Flovent for home use. She 
continued with albuterol nebs at home. She was given 
azithromycin to cover URI symptoms. She returned at 4pm due to 
increasing SOB since leaving urgent care despite using her 
nebulizer at home. At this point, she stated that she was 
wheezing continuously. Her peak flow was 100, HR 140, O2 sat 95% 
on RA. She was placed on 2L and O2 sat increased to 98% on RA. 
Patient was then sent to the ___ ED by ambulance.

In the ED, initial VS were 97.2 136 159/94 24 99% RA. Peak flow 
250 on arrival (baseline 400-450).

Lung exam was symmetric with poor air movement and wheeze 
consistent with asthma.

Labs showed patient was not pregnant. Flu swab was negative for 
influenza A and B.

CXR showed no PNA.

Patient was given multiple albuterol and duonebs x4 q4-8 hours, 
3L NS, 60mg PO prednisone, and chloraseptic throat spray. 
Admitted to ED obs overnight, however peak flow in AM 150-180, 
so decision was made to admit the patient to Medicine for 
further management.

Transfer VS were 97.7 120 143/89 25 99%RA. 

On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeing SOB and anxious.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of asthma who 
presents with severe acute asthma exacerbation after viral URI 
symptoms.

# Severe acute asthma exacerbation: This exacerbation likely 
occurred in the setting of URI given sore throat, cough, and 
nasal congestion for 2 days prior, and sick contact (daughter 
with URI) to exacerbation, as well as increased environmental 
exposure to dust, which has been a trigger in the past. There 
was no evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray. Patient received 
flu vaccine this year and influenza testing was negative. 
D-dimer was slightly elevated but given the clear URI component 
as well as her Wells of 0 and her PERC score which was 0 when 
her tachycardia resolved with treatment of her asthma, PE was 
thought very unlikely and the risks of CTA were thought to 
outweigh the benefits. Patient was given IVF and multiple 
albuterol and duonebs in the ED. Her peak flow did not improve 
overnight and she was admitted to Medicine. She continued to 
receive albuterol nebs q2hrs PRN, prednisone 60mg daily, 
guaifenesin, gauifenesin-codeine-phosphate, and chloroseptic 
throat spray. She did not have an oxygen requirement on the 
floor as O2 saturation remained >94%RA. Peak flow continued to 
be 160 for several days before improving. As patient has 
symptoms ___ times/week and nighttime symptoms ___ times/month 
reflecting moderate asthma at baseline, we switched her from 
Flovent to Advair for daily asthma control at home. Discharge 
peak flow 200s but patient reported feeling much better with 
assurance from patient that she would be able to follow up 
closely on discharge. Counseled on avoiding triggers for asthma. 
A post-discharge phone call demonstrated continued improvement.

# Tachycardia: Patient was tachycardic to 140 in the ED. She was 
given 3L IV fluids with decreased HR to 110-120. Patient 
continued to be tachycardic in the ___ until wheezing and 
peak flow improved.

# Hypertension: Patient had hypertension to the 140s-150s on 
admission that decreased to the 120s-130s with improvement in 
asthma symptoms.

# Diabetes mellitus: HbA1c 6.7%. Patient is aware and plans to 
improve diet and exercise once her asthma exacerbation resolves. 
She also plans to have more consistent outpatient follow-up as 
she has not seen her PCP for the past ___ years.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- f/u peak flow at next visit
- New diabetic: please f/u blood sugar control, lifestyle 
modifications and need for pharmacotherapy at next appointment; 
provide diabetes education if needed
- f/u BPs at next PCP visit, consider ___
- patient noted to have ptosis on exam though neurologic exam 
otherwise within normal limits, follow-up at next visit
