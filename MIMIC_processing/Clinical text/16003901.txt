History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed former smoker with a
past medical history including HTN, HLD who presented with an
acute change in mental status and, subsequently, difficulties
with language that prompted a code stroke.

The pt's wife explains her husband was in his usual state of
health upon awakening on the day of admission.  The two enjoyed
lunch together at about 1:15 pm (at which time the pt was last
well).  The pt's wife ran an errand and returned home about 2pm. 

At that time, her husband said he "felt funny in his head."
Although he has reportedly never used recreational drugs, he
compared the sensation to tripping on LSD.  As he seemed
increasingly confused, she brought him to the ___ where he
underwent a non-contrast head CT (which was found to be
negative).  Upon his return to the room, he began to use
"non-sensical" words and exhibit difficulties with 
comprehension.
Accordingly, a code stroke was called.

Upon our evaluation, the pt did not address questions directly. 
He did spontaneously (and repeatedly) volunteer phrases such as
"My head hurts; what do I do about that?  Can I have an 
aspirin?"
and "my mind is really screwed up," and " who are you?"  His 
wife
also thought he had composed some novel words.  The pt could not
identify his wife or remember meeting members of the care team. 
His wife denied similar episodes in the past.

The pt's wife denies focal weakness, numbness, facial asymmetry,
slurred speech, incontinenece, and tonic/clonic activity.  She
denies recent medication changes.  She denies the pt's use of
non-prescription drugs.  The pt has no h/o cardiac arrythmias 
and
dose not use asa or coumadin.

Radiology Report MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRASTStudy Date of ___ 
7:02 ___

FINDINGS:
 
There is no evidence for acute ischemia. There is no mass, mass 
effect or
midline shift. There is no hydrocephalus. There is a cerebral 
atrophy which
is predominant in the parietal lobes. There is also cerebellar 
atrophy.
 
 
MRA of the circle of ___ demonstrates no hemodynamically 
significant
stenosis or aneurysm within limits of exam. However, please note 
that the
study is motion degraded.
 
There is a large maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst on the 
right.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
No evidence for acute ischemia.
 
Parietal volume loss.
 
No hemodynamically significant stenosis in the intracranial 
vasculature.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed former smoker with a past 
medical history including HTN, HLD who presented with an acute 
change in mental status and, subsequently, difficulties with 
language.  The patient was initially evaluated as a code stroke. 
 He was not determined to be a tPA candidate, and had an MRI 
which showed no sign of ischemia and patent vasculature.  In the 
context of these symptoms, he also developed a headache, with a 
prodrome of 'wavy lines.'  It was suspected that his symptoms 
were secondary to complex migraine.  Exam on discharge showed no 
neurological deficits.

Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Complicated migraine vs. transient global amnesia
Secondary: HTN, HL

 
Discharge Condition:
Stable, memory and language deficits resolved.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with a transient episode of memory 
impairment and possible confusion.  You underwent an evaluation 
with MRI, and laboratory tests that did not show a tumor or a 
stroke or blood derangements.  Given that you had a headache, it 
was felt that you most likely had a complicated migraine or 
transient global amnesia.  An EEG was done to assess if you had 
signs of seizures and preliminary read did not show clear 
seizure focus. 

The following changes were made to you medications:
- none

Please follow up in clinic withe neurology as listed below. 

Should you develop weakness, tingling, difficulty with speech, 
changes in vision, fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, worsening 
headache, falls or any other symptom concerning to you, please 
call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
