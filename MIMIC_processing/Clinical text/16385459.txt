History of Present Illness:
The patient is an ___ year old gentleman with history of left

Imaging: 
CTA neck: 
1. Extensive atherosclerotic disease with severe stenosis at the 
origin of the 
left vertebral artery. 
2. By NASCET criteria, 25% stenosis of the petrous internal 
carotid arteries 
bilaterally. 
3. Partially imaged left lower lobe lung mass with extensive 
mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy, compatible with the patient's known history of 
malignancy. 
4. Left intraparotid mass lesion with heterogeneous enhancement 
as described 
detail above, probably consistent with Warthin's tumor, 
pleomorphic adenoma, a 
metastatic lesion cannot be completely rule out. 
5. Degenerative changes within the cervical spine. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted after a recent OSH MRI showed a small 
subacute ischemic stroke. This was completely incidental as he 
had no neurologic deficits on examination. CTA was without 
significant stenosis by NASCET criteria. Risk factors were 
modified by starting aspirin 81 mg daily. Given LDL 121, 
atorvastatin 40 mg daily was also started. Our goal LDL for him 
is <100. 
Given likely malignancy and stroke, which together likely 
indicate hypercoagulable state, we recommended that his 
oncologist and PCP consider whether or not therapeutic 
anticoagulation is indicated. If so, we feel comfortable with 
warfarin or any of the novel oral anticoagulants, and defer 
decision to his PCP. 
He has an OSH neurologist, with whom he will follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized after an MRI showed a recent ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
possible cancer, high cholesterol. 
  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
Start taking aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily. 
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Neurology Team
