Contrast injection revealed no filling defects in the biliary 
tree.  
A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed with the 
sphincterotome.  
There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding.

defects in the CBD.  
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically.

a hospitalization in mid ___ for 3days with negative

RUQ u/s
  
  
1. No signs of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. 
2. Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation seen in the left 
hepatic lobe is 
new since the prior MRCP.  Please correlate clinically and may 
consider 
nonemergent MRCP for further evaluation. 
3. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease 
including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded 
on the basis of this examination.
