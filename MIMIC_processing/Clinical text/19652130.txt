Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Dr. ___ service for 
nephrolithiasis management with a known left obstructing stone 
and acute kidney injury.  He was admitted to the general 
surgical floor and overnight treated for pain, hydrated and 
optimized for surgical intervention. On HD2 he was taken to the 
operative theatre and underwent urgent (as an add-on) 
cystoscopy, left retrograde ureteral pyelogram, left stone 
manipulation, left double-J stent placement. He tolerated the 
procedure well and recovered in the PACU before transfer to the 
general surgical floor. See the dictated operative note for full 
details. Overnight, the patient was hydrated with intravenous 
fluids and received appropriate perioperative prophylactic 
antibiotics. On POD1, he was voiding well without complaint and 
confident about returning home. At discharge on POD1, patients 
pain was controlled with oral pain medications, tolerating 
regular diet, ambulating without assistance, and voiding without 
difficulty.  He was explicitly advised to follow up as directed 
as the indwelling ureteral stent must be removed and or 
exchanged and definitive treatment must be addressed.

Discharge Instructions:
-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to 
possibly experience some urgency and frequency over the next 
month;  this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or 
the indwelling ureteral stent (if there is one).

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter.; This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed. 

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) 

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You 
should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.  HOLD ASPIRIN and aspirin containing products for one 
week unless otherwise advised.

For pain control, try TYLENOL FIRST, and then take the narcotic 
pain medication as prescribed if additional pain relief is 
needed.

gentle laxative. These are  over-the-counter medications that 
may be health care spending account reimbursable. 

-Colace (docusate sodium) may have been prescribed to avoid 
post-surgical constipation or constipation related to use of 
narcotic pain medications. Discontinue if loose stool or 
diarrhea develops. Colace is a stool-softener, NOT a laxative.

-Senokot (or any gentle laxative) may have been prescribed to 
further minimize your risk of constipation. 

-Do not eat constipating foods for ___ weeks, drink plenty of 
fluids to keep hydrated
