   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): 

___ Imaging:

Date of Service: ___
Procedure(s): US abdomen RT upper quadrant
FINDINGS:  Liver is mildly echogenic.  No focal liver lesions 
are identified.  There is no intrahepatic biliary
dilatation.  Common duct measures 4 mm in diameter.  Patient is 
status post cholecystectomy.  Flow in the main portal
vein is hepatopetal.  Pancreas is not well visualized due to 
overlying bowel gas.  The right kidney measures 11.4 cm in
length.  In the interpolar right kidney, a simple appearing cyst 
measures 1.2 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm.  No evidence for stones,
solid masses or hydronephrosis involving the right kidney.

IMPRESSION:  Echogenic appearance of the liver suggesting 
steatosis although more advanced forms of liver disease
cannot be excluded.  No biliary dilatation.  Simple appearing 
cyst in the right kidney.

Date of Service: ___
Procedure(s): CT abdomen pelvis w con
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute abnormality involving the abdomen or 
pelvis.
2. Incidental note is made of a partially imaged lobulated mass 
in the right lower lobe, measuring up to 2.8 cm.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o HTN, Afib on Xarelto, s/p Pacemaker, CAD s/p CABG, 
Bacterial Endocarditis, coccidiomycosis in ___ with residual 
lung nodule, s/p CCY admitted with abd pain, nausea and found to 
have elevated LFTs c/w hepatitis

# Acute Hepatitis
  Mr. ___ presented with abd pain, nausea to ___ 
___.  LFTs were found to be elevated : ALT AST in the 1000s 
ALKP 200s TB 2.5.  Abd CT scan and RUQ U/S showed no bil dil or 
choledocholithiasis.  He presented here to ___ thereafter - 
and here, in the ED, the LFTs were noted to be even greater in 
value.   Hepatology was consulted in the ED.  Multiple tests 
were sent, including Hep serologies, HCV VL, EBV VL/serologies, 
CMV VL, HSV PCR, HEV RNA detection. Hep A, B, and C serologies 
were negative.  There was no ingestion of illicits. He was 
admitted for further eval. The other tests are pending at the 
time of discharge.
     During the hospital stay, his symptoms were steadily 
improving - with reduced nausea and abd discomfort.  By the time 
of discharge, he noted recovery of his appetite and ability to 
tolerate breakfast without any issues.   His AST/ALT were 
downtrending on HD1 but TBili/Alk Phos was still increasing only 
until HD2.  Given the transient elevation of LFTs and short 
course of symptoms, his presentation was attributed to acute 
viral infection.  Given his recent CCY in ___, the 
possibility of CBD stone (passed) was considered - however, the 
dramatic rise in LFTs without significant biliary dilatation and 
the steady rise in LFTs persisting 2 days after an abd CT, RUQ 
U/S showed no CBD dilatation, argued strongly against a CBD 
stone as the etiology.  
    He was discharged with instructions to hold off on resuming 
the Lipitor until his f/u with his PCP.  His other medications 
may be continued.  His albumin was normal and there was no signs 
of encephalopathy during his stay here.  He was ambulatory 
throughout the hospitalization.  

# CAD s/p CABG
- Atorvastatin was held. Has been off Aspirin for a year

# Primary Hypertension
- Amlodipine was continued 

# Atrial fibrillation - normally on Xarelto
 - No rate control agents
 - Xarelto was held and restarted on discharge
 - CHADS2VASC ~2 (primary risk is age) so did not require any 
bridging

# Lung Nodule
- This nodule is known by both the patient and his providers, so
does not need us to arrange followup.  Attributed Valley Fever

# Obstructive Sleep Apnea
- CPAP

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
   It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you 
presented with abdominal pain, nausea - and were found to have 
markedly elevated liver tests.  Imaging here (ultrasound and CT 
scan) showed no clear anatomical problem that could have caused 
your problem.
   
   You were observed in the hospital, and over time, your 
symptoms and liver function tests improved.  Given the 
relatively short rise and decrease in liver tests, we believe 
that your symptoms are attributable to a viral infection.  
Hepatitis A/B/C tests were negative, but other causes (such as 
CMV, EBV, etc..) are pending at the time of your departure.

    There are no real restrictions to your physical activity.  
You may also resume your previous medications as prescribed 
(note: except for the Lipitor which can cause liver function 
test abnormalities - we recommend holding this until you see 
your doctor).  Please follow up with your primary care doctor 
and obtain a blood test to ensure steady improvements in your 
liver tests.  

    If you have any questions,  feel free to contact 
___ (Dr. ___.  We wish you well, safe 
travels, and quick recovery.
