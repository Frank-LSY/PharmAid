MRCP:
1.  Surgically absent gallbladder. Elongated, approximately 5.7 
x 1.2 x 1.7 cm heterogeneous, irregularly marginated, T2 
hypointense collection in the gallbladder fossa, which tracks 
along the medial margin of the inferior right hepatic lobe.  
Areas of T1 hyperintensity within this collection, likely 
representing hemorrhage.  No extravasation of hepatobiliary 
contrast into the collection to indicate bile leak. 
  
2.  Mild contour nodularity of the liver, suggestive of 
cirrhotic change.  No focal hepatic lesion. 

ERCP:
Impression: 
Normal major papilla.  
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.  
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification.  
Upon contrast injection extravasation was noted at the cystic 
duct.  
The right intrahepatic biliary tree was not well visualized.  
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using 
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.  
No evidence of post sphincterotomy bleeding  
A ___ cm biliary plastic stent was placed.  
Post stent placement excellent bile and contrast was noted both 
endoscopically and fluoroscopically.  
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with recent cholecystectomy (___) who was 
diagnosed with a bile leak and underwent ERCP on ___ with CBD 
stent placement. MRCP showed possible hemorrhage in the 
gallbladder fossa but no extravasation of hepatobiliary contrast 
into the collection to indicate bile leak. Of note, MRCP also 
showed liver contour nodularity concerning for cirrhosis. Pt was 
admitted post-procedure for observation. He did well overnight, 
H/H remained stable, and he was tolerating an oral diet with no 
abdominal pain prior to discharge.

He was instructed to complete a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin as 
an outpatient. Per the ERCP team, he was okay to resume his 
warfarin 24 hr post-procedure. He was instructed to have his INR 
checked in 2 days given the interaction with ciprofloxacin and 
warfarin. He will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent pull and 
re-evaluation. ERCP also recommended he follow-up with 
hepatology as an outpatient due to the findings on MRCP 
concerning for cirrhosis.
