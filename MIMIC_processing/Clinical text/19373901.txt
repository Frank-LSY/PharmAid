Imaging: 

___: EKG:
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm with an atrial premature beat 
with aberration versus ventricular premature beat. Late R wave 
progression. No previous tracing available for comparison.  

___: CT L-Spine:
1. Loss of T12 through L3 vertebral body height of uncertain 
chronicity, 
although there is no evidence of prevertebral soft tissue 
swelling or edema to suggest acuity.  However, in the context of 
osteopenia and if clinically indicated and there no 
contraindications, MRI would be more sensitive to acute 
fractures in the setting. 
2. Scoliosis with severe degenerative changes. 
3. Large hiatal hernia. 

___: CT Head:
Unchanged left parietal subdural hematoma with minimal 
effacement of the 
underlying sulci but no shift of normally midline structures. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female who was transferred from 
___ after being seen there for multiple recent falls with 
increasing confusion.  At ___, she was found to have a L SDH 
as well as possible offset of C1 over C2 on left side, possibly 
due to patient neck position. She was admitted to the Acute Care 
Surgery/Trauma service for further medical management.  

On HD1, the patient had a head CT which demonstrated a left 
parietal SDH without shift.  She was evaluated by the 
Neurosurgery team and started on Keppra x 7 days with future 
follow-up in clinic.  The patient had a CT C-spine concerning 
for minimal offset of C1 over C2 on the left side.  On HD1, she 
was evaluated by the Orthopaedics team and they felt that, given 
her lack of neck pain and reassuring neurological examination, 
they did not feel that this finding on CT warranted further
diagnostic evaluation unless the patient becomes symptomatic.

On HD1, the patient was started on a regular diet which was 
well-tolerated.  SQH was held given risk of bleeding with SDH.  
The patient had a UA positive for UTI and she was started on a 5 
day course of Bactrim.  Urine was sent for culture which was 
pending at the time of discharge, but will be followed-up. 

The remainder of the ___ hospital course is summarized by 
systems below: 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization with periods of confusion and forgetfulness as 
per baseline. Pain was managed with oral acetaminophen. 

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 

GI/GU/FEN: The patient tolerated a regular diet. Patient's 
intake and output were closely monitored

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of acute bleeding, of which there were none.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after suffering a fall and were found 
to have a left subdural hematoma (head bleed) and a urinary 
tract infection.  You were admitted to the Trauma/Acute Care 
Surgery team for further medical care.

Your subdural hematoma was evaluated by the Neurosurgery team 
and you were started on a one (1) week course of a medication 
called Keppra to prevent seizures. Please follow-up with the 
Neurosurgery team at your listed appointment below.

The Orthopaedic team evaluated your neck for any injury and 
found no concerning findings.  They recommended that you can 
wear a soft collar for comfort, but also recommended that if you 
begin to experience pain in your spine, have numbness, or 
weakness in your extremities, that you call the Orthopaedic 
Spine office for a follow-up appointment (the phone number is 
listed below). 

You were started on an antibiotic called Bactrim to treat your 
urinary tract infection.  Please complete the full course of 
this medicine.  

You are now medically cleared to be discharged back to your 
skilled nursing facility.  Please note the following discharge 
instructions:

Return to the Emergency Department or see your own doctor right 
away if any problems develop, including the following:
 Persistent nausea or vomiting.
 Increasing confusion, drowsiness or any change in alertness.
 Loss of memory.
 Dizziness or fainting.
 Trouble walking or staggering.

compared to the other eye.
 Weakness or numbness of an arm or leg.
 Stiff neck or fever.
 Blurry vision, double vision or other problems with your
