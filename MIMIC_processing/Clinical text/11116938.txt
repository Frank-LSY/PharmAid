Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female admitted to ___ from an OSH on ___ s/p MVC. Pt

numbness/weakness. At OSH CT of the head was negative and CT of 
the C-spine and T-spine were also read as negative.

numbness in left upper extremity. She underwent C/T-spine MRI 
that was unrevealing On exam, the patient had generalized 
numbness to pin prick isolated to the left arm involving 
multiple dermatomes, mostly C5 through T1. These findings are 
suggestive of a lesion likely involving the brachial plexus.  
The mechanism of injury is likely stretch from whiplash injury.  
They recommended ___ additional testing at this time. If 
weakness/numbness persists, may consider EMG/NCS in several 
weeks as an outpatient, and ___ clinic follow up for post 
concussive syndrome.

ENT was consulted for patient's complaints of muffled hearing in 
her left ear. They recommended outpatient audiogram. ___ and OT 
evaluate the patient and clear her for discharge home with
