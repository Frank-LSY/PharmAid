Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented on ___ for an open ventral hernia 
repair with mesh for his strangulated fat-containing ventral 
hernia. There were no adverse events in the operating room; 
please see the operative note for details. Post-operatively the 
patient was taken to the PACU until stable and then transferred 
to the wards until stable to go home. 

#NEURO: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was managed with oral pain medications 
that included Tylenol and oxycodone. Pain was very well 
controlled.

#CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.  

#PULMONARY: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.  

#GI/GU/FEN: The patient had a foley that was placed 
intraoperatively that was removed postop. However, likely due to 
his underlying BPH, patient had post void residuals and so was 
straight catheterized on POD1. He again was retaining urine and 
so a foley catheter was placed that was kept for 24 hours. He 
was able to void spontaneously on POD2. The patient was 
initially given clears and advanced to a regular diet. He was 
tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge. He also was 
passing flatus and stooling prior to discharge.

#ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs 
of infection, of which there were none. However, his mid 
abdominal wound where the regular wound VAC was placed showed 
some blanching erythema. The wound VAC was removed on POD1 and 
he was started on Keflex that he would continue for 7 days. He 
was afebrile and the wound did not show other signs of infection 
such as fluctuation or purulent drainage.

#HEME: Patient received BID SQH for DVT prophylaxis, in addition 
to encouraging early ambulation and Venodyne compression 
devices.
