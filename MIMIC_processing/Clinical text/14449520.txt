Brief Hospital Course:
Spoke with patient's daughter ___ and ___ at bedside with
neurosurgical team. Neurosurgery recommended against EVD, as it
would not be likely to improve her outcome. Discussed with
___ son and daughter that we have no medications to fix the
bleeding in the brain. Our options are to support her medically
as we face the impending sequalae of a large intraventricular
hemorrhage, the most devastating of which is hydrocephalus 
(which
was already noted to be developing on the CT scan). Our other
option is to make ___ comfortable, and forego invasive
measures in an effort to prolong life, and instead focus on
making her as comfortable as possible. Her son and daughter said
that ___ has spent quite a bit of time focusing on end of 
life
issues for others; she cared for her husband in the end of his
life, and she also worked in an Alzheimer's support group 
helping
people cope with end of life issues. Her children know that she
would not want to live a life that she could not be at least
mentally fully functional. Her ICH score was a 4, meaning that
she has a very high 30 day mortality risk (~97%). Given her poor
prognosis, they opted to pursue comfort measures only, which
seems appropriate given her high baseline functional status, her
goal of a high quality of life, and minimizing suffering.
