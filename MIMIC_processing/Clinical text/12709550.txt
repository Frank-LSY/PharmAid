IMAGING
============
___ CTA HEAD AND NECK
1. No emergent large vessel occlusion. 
2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
3. Mild intracranial atherosclerosis, without stenosis. 
4. Mild extracranial atherosclerosis. No internal carotid artery 
stenosis by NASCET criteria. There is a small distal left ICA 
pseudoaneurysm, most likely the sequela of a remote dissection. 
5. Confluent opacification within the right upper lobe may 
reflect fibrosis related to prior radiation therapy given the 
clinical history of breast cancer. 
.
.
___ MRI BRAIN W/O CONTRAST
1. No evidence for acute infarction. 
2. Probable mild chronic small vessel disease.

CHEST XRAY ___
No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.

EKG
NSR

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with medical history of hypertension, asthma,
breast cancer in ___ status post resection, and complete
blindness in the setting of detached retinas presenting to the
emergency department for evaluation of cognitive 
slowing/fogginess with 1 hour of transient right upper and lower 
extremity paresthesias as well as a sensation of tongue 
numbness. 

Her extremity sensory symptoms were resolved by the time she was 
admitted and her cognitive symptoms improved slowly over time. 
At the time of evaluation the next morning after admission, she 
had a mild abnormal sensation over her tongue - 90% of normal. 

Her neurologic exam was significant for hyperreflexia on the 
right more than left - with right Hoffmans, right two beats 
patellar clonus, b/l crossed adductors, b/l 1 beat of ankle 
clonus. Otherwise, normal mental status, cranial nerves (aside 
for ocular motility - not tested due to blindness and corneal 
scarring), full strength, sensation, coordination, gait. 

Suspect TIA, however her report of cognitive slowing was odd - 
could have been related to hypertensive encephalopathy as she 
was reported to 180s systolic by EMTs. Ddx also includes 
migraine phenomena - she had migraines (throbbing HA, 
photophobia) when younger associated with menses - never had any 
visual or sensory phenomena. 

CTA showed subtle left ICA terminus possible pseudoaneurysm 
5mmx3mm which was not obvious on our review and b/l carotid 
artery atherosclerosis. 

MRI Brain was negative for any stroke or intracranial pathology 
but did show small vessel disease.

HbA1C pending, Lipid panel pending, TSH pending at the time of 
discharge - however, she has no history of DM and she was 
started on Atorvastatin. 

Echocardiogram can be obtained as an outpatient - ordered in our 
system and patient given the number to schedule.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Ms ___, 
  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right arm, leg, and 
face/tongue numbness likely related to a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC 
ATTACK, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is transiently blocked by a clot. The 
only odd part of your history is that you had the cognitive 
slowing/difficulty prior to the sensory symptoms - though this 
could have been related to high blood pressure. It is also 
possible that this was related to a migraine like phenomena.  
The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all 
the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being 
deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of 
symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Atherosclerosis in your vessels
- High blood pressure

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Starting an aspirin 81mg daily
- Starting Atorvastatin 20mg at night

Your primary care provider should follow up your cholesterol lab 
tests and adjust the atorvastatin as needed. 

You can schedule an echocardiogram at ___ - this has 
been ordered in the ___ system. 

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  

 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  

 Your ___ Neurology Team
