History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMH HTN, asplenia, SVT s/p ablation who 
presents as a transfer from ___ after a smear 
was concerning for babesiosis. He says the current presentation 
started 3 weeks ago. He first noticed he wasn't feeling well 
when he ate a burger at Five Guys with some friends and it felt 
like it took 2d to digest. He then developed a cough so a friend 
prescribed him a Z-pack. His symptoms did not resolve and he 
started developing fevers ranging from 100.4 to 103.3. He was 
also having such severe chills that at times he had to shut the 
AC off and turned the heat up to ___. 2d ago he presented to his 
PCP for the persistent cough and was prescribed Levofloxacin, 
and was told that if his symptoms did not improve by ___ 
he should get a CXR. The night prior to presentation he had 
drenching night sweats so he came to the ___ ED.  
 In the ___ ED he was found to be hyponatremic (128) 
with smear concerning for intracellular parasites so he was seen 
by ID. Parasite count and legionella antigen from OSH are 
pending. He was given CTX, atovaquone, and doxycycline. 
Initially he was afebrile on arrival but then spiked a fever to 
103.0 and was given APAP. He was also desaturating and requiring 
2L O2. He was transferred to ___ for concern for babesiosis.  
 Of note, he says he has had 4 tick bites this year, most 
recently at the end of ___. His most recent travel was to 
___ in ___. His mother recently had pneumonia but other 
than that he is not aware of any sick contacts. Other than his 
cough, fevers, and chills he denies CP, SOB, N/V/D, abdominal 
pain.  
 In the ED, initial VS were 98.9 95 134/93 18 95% Nasal Cannula. 
His exam was unremarkable. His labs were notable for 
hyponatremia (130), LDH 459, Hgb 11.6, plt 101. CXR showed a RLL 
consolidation with trace bilateral pleural effusions. He was not 
given any more medications in our ED.  
 Transfer VS were 99.3PO 145 / 83 92 20 94 RA  
 On arrival to the floor, patient reports that he is feeling ok. 
He is having a persistent cough. Upon arrival he was given 500mg 
Azithromycin for treatment of babesiosis as he had not yet 
received this.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMH HTN, asplenia, SVT s/p ablation who 
presents as a transfer from ___ after a smear 
was concerning for babesiosis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Lyme 
# Babesiosis: Given asplenia at greater risk for severe 
infection, but at the time of admission his parasite load on the 
parasite smear was only 1.8% (___) to 2.1% (___), did not have 
elevated alkaline phosphatase, and was < ___ y/o, which puts him 
at lower risk for fulminant disease. Decreased to 0.5% on ___. 
Fever curve trending down and clinically stable. Seen by ID who 
approved antibiotic course. Will continue azithromycin 250mg PO 
Q24 and atovaquone 750mg PO BID for babesia for planned 6 week 
course (last day ___. Will take doxycycline 100mg PO BID x 
14 days for Lyme (last day ___. PCP to please follow 
anaplasma and borrelia serologies still pending at ___ 
___.

# RLL infiltrate: 
# Cough: Patient has a persistent cough with RLL consolidation 
and pleural effusion. This may represent pneumonia or 
infiltrate/ARDS with babesiosis, but does not clinically appear 
to have ARDS. At ___ legionella antigen was sent because of RLL 
infiltrate and concomitant hyponatremia. Negative strep pneumo 
antigen and legionella at ___. Was treated with CTX from ___ to 
___, but due to low concern for CAP was discontinued and 
discharged on antibiotics as above. 

# Anemia: Babesiosis is often accompanied by hemolytic anemia 
and thrombocytopenia. This is most likely hemolytic anemia as a 
result of his babesiosis given his elevated LDH. DIC was also on 
the differential but his fibrinogen was normal. Unclear 
baseline.

# Asplenia: Although most likely source of his sepsis is 
babesiosis, he is at risk for bacterial pathogens as well. 
Provided with Augmentin for pill-in-pocket empiric therapy and 
instructions to see PCP for vaccinations.

# Hyponatremia: UOSm is 310 and UNa < 20, most likely 
hypovolemic hyponatremia from fevers with drenching night 
sweats. Resolved with IV fluids.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# HTN: Continued home losartan and metoprolol. 

# Alcohol use: He reported drinking 4 drinks per night at home, 
but has not had a drink in 1 week because of feeling ill. As his 
last drink was 1 week ago, he was out of the normal window for 
alcohol withdrawal symptoms so he was not put on a CIWA scale. 
AST elevated. Should have LFTs rechecked and alcohol counseling 
from PCP.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] New medications
- Atovaquone Suspension 750 mg PO/NG BID x 6 weeks (last day 
___
- Azithromycin 250 mg PO/NG Q24H x 6 weeks (last day ___ 
- Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg PO Q12H x 2 weeks (last day ___ 

- Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid ___ mg PO PRN fever over 100.4 or 
shaking chills 
[] Due to asplenia, provided with pill in pocket (Augmentin) if 
patient has fevers > 100.4 at home
[] PCP to ensure patient up to date on vaccinations below
- Influenza
- Tdap
- Hib 
- Pneumococcal vaccines 
- Meningococcal vaccines 
[] PCP to please follow up pending borrelia and anaplasma 
serology at ___
[] PCP to check repeat CBC and parasite smear to ensure 
infection resolved, refer to ID if still parasitemia (discharge 
1.1% parasitemia)
[] Elevated AST and reported 4+ drinks per night, PCP to recheck 
LFTs and counsel patient on EtOH use
[] Recommend PCP conduct outpatient repeat CXR to ensure 
resolution of infiltrate versus need for CT imaging

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were transferred to ___ with concern for a 
babesia infection. You were also found to have Lyme disease. 
This was causing fever, sweating, and cough.

You were seen here by our infectious disease specialists. You 
were started on several strong antibiotics that you will 
continue taking for several weeks. 

Because you don't have a spleen, you are at higher risk for 
infection. You should see your PCP for vaccinations to make sure 
you're up to date. If you EVER develop a fever over 100.4 or 
severe shaking chills, you should take an antibiotic pill 
(Augmentin) and see your doctor as soon as possible. We also 
recommend that you wear a medical alert bracelet explaining your 
asplenia.

When you see your PCP on ___, they should check some blood 
work to ensure the infection is controlled.

It was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish 
you all the best.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Health Team
