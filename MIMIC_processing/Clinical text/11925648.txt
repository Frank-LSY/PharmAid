IMAGING:
=========
CT ___ ___, prelim):
1. There is no evidence of suspicious masses or lesions within
the abdomen/pelvis. 
2. Mild dilatation of the common bile duct is nonspecific. It is
smoothly tapers to the ampulla. There is no evidence of an
obstructing mass or lesion. Please correlate with patient's
clinical picture and labs. An MRCP or ERCP can be performed for
further characterization if clinically indicated. 

EKG (___):
NSR at 94 bpm, nl axis, PR 165, QRS 89, QTC 434, TWI V1-V2
(similar to ___

CTA chest (___):
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.  No 
focal
consolidation. 

CTA head/neck (___):
1. Head CT: No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. CTA Head: Patent circle of ___ without evidence of
stenosis,occlusion,or aneurysm. 
3. CTA Neck: Patent bilateral cervical carotid and vertebral
arteries without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or dissection. 


R ___ (___):
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower
extremity veins.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx dysautonomia and chronic fatigue syndrome,
depression/anxiety, possible Sjogren's syndrome vs
undifferentiated autoimmune condition, chronic nausea,
osteoarthritis s/p recent R TKA presenting with nausea and
lightheadedness, admitted for acute on chronic anemia.

# Normocytic anemia:
# Iron deficiency:
Hgb 11.2 in early ___, downtrended to 8.4 on ___ and
nadired at 6.1 this presentation. Etiology unclear, but
potentially concerning for slow UGIB given one guaiac positive
stool this admission (in absence of gross melena/hematochezia)
and mild iron deficiency (ferritin 48, Tsat 9%). Colonoscopy in
___ (and per patient a more recent colonoscopy) normal; EGD 
___
showed non-erosive gastropathy. R knee without evidence of
hematoma, and onset of anemia reportedly preceded her recent
surgery. No e/o RP bleeding, hematuria, hemoptysis, or
post-menopausal bleeding. No e/o hemolysis with nl bili, LDH,
haptoglobin, and retic count. CRP WNL and ferritin 48, making
anemia of inflammation unlikely as well. B12/folate WNL.
Responded robustly to 2u pRBCs this admission, with Hgb 6.1 ->
9.4 on discharge. She likely warrants a repeat EGD +/-
colonoscopy, which can be performed as an outpatient given
absence of HD-significant bleeding and resolution of her
symptoms. Previously arranged GI ___ at ___ is scheduled for
___. Would consider initiation of iron supplementation at PCP
or GI ___.

# Lightheadedness:
# Palpitations:
# Fatigue:
# Dysautonomia:
# Chronic fatigue syndrome:
Presents with acute on chronic lightheadedness, palpitations, 
and
fatigue in setting of suspected underlying dysautonomia and
chronic fatigue syndrome. Suspect that these underlying
conditions were exacerbated by concurrent anemia, as above, but
low suspicion that anemia is directly/causally related. CTA 
chest
and CTA head/neck in ED without e/o PE, CVA, or carotid 
stenosis.
AM cortisol was negative. EKG NSR without e/o ischemia and
cardiac enzymes negative. Telemetry without arrhythmias. TTE
deferred in absence of murmur. Initial orthostasis resolved with
fluids and transfusion, so no clear indication for pharmacologic
intervention for dysautonomia at present (was previously on
florinef and mestinon; midodrine had previously been considered
but not initiated).  Her home propranol was held in hospital and
on discharge, to be resumed by PCP as deemed appropriate. She 
may
benefit from ___ with Dr. ___ at ___ for further evaluation
and management of chronic fatigue syndrome and dysautonomia. 

# Nausea:
Unclear etiology despite extensive evaluation over years. In
setting of possible slow UGIB, likely warrants repeat EGD, which
can be pursued as an outpatient (GI ___ previously arranged for
___ at ___). At request of patient's PCP, CT ___ w/cont
obtained, which preliminarily showed no suspicious 
masses/lesions
and no e/o obstruction. Preliminary read comments on mild
dilation of CBD, but normal LFTs argue against biliary
obstruction. Could consider MRCP vs ERCP for further w/u as
outpatient. Patient was tolerating a regular diet at discharge.

# Osteoarthritis:
# S/p R TKA:
R TKA appeared to be healing well without e/o hematoma. Home
oxycodone PRN continued. She will ___ with her orthopedic 
surgeon
as previously scheduled.

# Prior concern for Sjogen's:
# Positive ___:
Previously evaluated by rheumatology in setting of positive ___
with titer 1:320 (___), initially thought to have Sjogren's,
which was then deemed less likely on subsequent evaluations. Had
been on Cellcept, Plaquenil, and IVIG, not recently. No
arthralgias, myalgias, or sicca symptoms to suggest active
autoimmune condition, including Sjogren's. Absence of morning
stiffness largely exonerates PMR, and no HA/claudication to
suggest GCA (and CRP/ESR WNL). RF and CCP negative this
admission. ___ positive with titer pending at discharge, but SLE
thought less likely. Can consider further rheumatology 
evaluation
as outpatient.

# Depression:
# Anxiety:
Continued home clonazepam, brexpiprazole, paroxetine.

# Possible EBV viremia:
Reports that she was diagnosed with this by physician in
___ and started on valacyclovir. No clear marrow
suppression reported from valacyclovir, which was resumed on
discharge.

# Emergency contact: ___
Relationship: Husband Phone: ___

initiation of iron supplementation
