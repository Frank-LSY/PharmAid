Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with a h/o internal/external rectal hemorrhoids, colonic 
polyps presenting with 2 months of rectal bleeding and fatigue, 
found to be severely anemic with Hgb 5.  

# Symptomatic iron-deficiency anemia: Patient presents with 
severe microcytic anemia, marked iron deficiency with almost 
undetectable ferritin. Iron deficit is ~1500 mg.  This is likely 
the cause of her fatigue, dyspnea, cravings. Coags and platelets 
were normal, as was B12.  SPEP and UPEP pending at discharge.  
She received 2 units pRBCs with appropriate rise in Hgb to 7.8.  
GI and colorectal surgery were consulted and on colonoscopy on 
___, she was found to have small internal hemorrhoids without 
signs of active bleeding.  These were felt not to be the source 
of her profound anemia as hemorrhoidal bleeds are usually 
self-limited.  A TTG-IgA was pending at discharge and she will 
be set up for an outpatient EGD for further workup.  She was 
started on oral iron repletion and had no further significant 
bleeding during this admission.        

# HTN: On no therapy at baseline. She was not treated in this 
acute setting given bleeding.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please check CBC on ___ to ensure stability 
- Please ensure patient has outpatient EGD performed within ___ 
weeks
- Please follow up TTG-IgA which is pending at discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for rectal bleeding and very 
low blood counts.  We did a colonoscopy and did not find a 
significant source of bleeding that would explain why your blood 
counts were so low.  

You have very low iron levels and it is possible this is due to 
a lack of iron in your diet.  Please take your iron supplements. 
 We will also schedule you for an upper endoscopy to see if 
there is bleeding from your stomach, in ___ weeks.  You will be 
contacted by our GI department about this appointment.

Please see your primary care doctor on ___ and have your 
blood counts checked again.

Best wishes,
Your ___ Providers
