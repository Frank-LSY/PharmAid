Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was unremarkable

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  Given her history of DVT with her last knee 
surgery, the patient received Lovenox 40mg SXC daily for DVT 
prophylaxis starting 12 hours post-op.  The surgical dressing 
was changed and the Silverlon dressing was removed on POD#2. The 
surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without 
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the wound was benign

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
