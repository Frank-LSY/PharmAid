IMAGING:  
CT A/P (___) ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple gallstones with common duct stones.
2. Either congenital or surgical interaction involving the 
lumbar
spine with lytic changes and high density material involving the 
L5
vertebral body, fusion of posterior elements L4-S1, Tarlov cysts 
S2,
degenerative changes L2-L3. Please correlate to history
3. Renal cysts and diverticular disease of the colon.

RUQ U/S ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. 
2. Common bile duct is mildly dilated. Intrahepatic bile ducts 
are normal size. 
3. A 3 mm echogenic focus is identified in the common bile duct 

ERCP Impression: Normal major papilla 
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was 
injected resulting in complete opacification. The procedure was 
mildly difficult.   
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left 
hepatic ducts, and biliary radicles were filled with contrast 
and well visualized.
There was evidence of possible distal CBD filling defects 
consistent with bile duct stones. 
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using 
a sphincterotome.
The sphincterotome was exchanged for an extraction balloon 
catheter. Balloon sweeps were performed and yielded sludge and 9 
CBD stones.
 Further sweeps were performed until no debris was noted.  
Recommendations: NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration 
with LR at 200 cc/hr 
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated 
Recommend outpatient surgical evaluation for possible 
cholecystectomy. 
No aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for 5 days.
