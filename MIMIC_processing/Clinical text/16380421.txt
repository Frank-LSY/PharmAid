Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing robotic right 
nephroureterectomy and TURBT with instillation of gemcitabine.

No concerning intraoperative events occurred; please see 
dictated operative note for details. The patient received 
perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient was 
transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable condition. On 
POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated for urine output 
>30cc/hour, provided with pneumoboots and incentive spirometry 
for prophylaxis, and ambulated once.  

On POD1, the patient was restarted on home medications, basic 
metabolic panel and complete blood count were checked, pain 
control was transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was 
advanced to a clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, JP was 
removed without difficulty and diet was advanced as tolerated. 
The remainder of the hospital course was relatively 
unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable condition on 
POD#3 with foley catheter in place, eating well, ambulating 
independently, voiding without difficulty, and with pain control 
on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, dry, and 
intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection or infection. 
The patient was given explicit instructions to follow-up in 
clinic for void trial in 2 days and for routine post operative 
check in four weeks.

and return the log sheet at your follow up appointment. Remember 
to also bring the narcotic prescription bottle WITH YOU for your 
follow up appointment.

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications except as noted. 
ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication changes 
and your post-operative course with your primary care doctor.

-___ reduce the strain/pressure on your abdomen and incision 
sites; remember to log roll onto your side and then use your 
hands to push yourself upright while taking advantage of the 
momentum of putting your legs/feet to the ground.

--There may be bandage strips called steristrips which have 
been applied to reinforce wound closure.  Allow these bandage 
strips to fall off on their own over time but PLEASE REMOVE ANY 
REMAINING GAUZE DRESSINGS WITHIN 2 DAYS OF DISCHARGE. You may 
get the steristrips wet.

-UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED; AVOID aspirin or aspirin containing 
products and supplements that may have blood-thinning effects

medication reconciliation. 

IF PRESCRIBED (see the MEDICATION RECONCILIATION):

-IBUPROFEN (the ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be taken 
even though you may also be taking Tylenol/Acetaminophen. You 
may alternate these medications for pain control.  

For pain control, try TYLENOL (acetaminophen) FIRST, then 
ibuprofen, and then take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)

-Call your Urologist's office to schedule/confirm your follow-up 
appointment in 4 weeks AND if you have any questions.
