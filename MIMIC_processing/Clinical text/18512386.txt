History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ right handed woman with a past
medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents
for evaluation of new onset aphasia, likely stroke.

History gathered from family (2 daughters and 1 granddaughter) 
at
bedside.

Essentially, she was last known well at 730am when she was
talking on the phone with her daughter.  Her daughter called her
again at 11am.  On the phone that time, Mrs. ___ was just
speaking "gibberish".  Nothing she said made sense and most of 
it
was not recognizable language.  Her family rushed over and EMS
was called.  She was noted to have a right facial droop, but
otherwise was without clear weakness.

She was taken to OSH at roughly 11am.  where NIHSS was 8 "(R
facial droop, dysarthria, word salad, can repeat)".  She was not
felt to be a candidate for tPA given last known well of 730am. 
She was given aspirin 325mg.  NCHCT and CTA were without acute
findings and she was transferred for further management.

Of note, her daughters report that she has not felt herself for
the past several months.  She has been very nervous and kept
complaining about "nervousness and weakness". S he never wanted
to be alone.  She has had several CT scans in the past month
reportedly, but nothing was clearly found to be abnormal. 
Additionally, she had a recent fall in ___.

URINE CULTURE (Final ___: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 
COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL 
CONTAMINATION. 

==============
IMAGING
==============
ECHO (___):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild 
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (peak 20 
mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). 
Severe aortic valve stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be quanitified. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic global systolic 
function. Mild resting LVOT gradient. No definite structural 
cardiac source of embolism identified. Increased PCWP.  

MRI BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST (___):
1. Large acute to subacute left frontal infarct in the left MCA 
territory. 
2. Subacute infarct within the left splenium of the corpus 
callosum extending to the left occipital lobe. 
3. Punctate foci of acute infarct in the left superior 
cerebellar hemisphere, left periatrial white matter and left 
medial temporal lobe. 
4. Small subacute infarct in the right frontal centrum 
semiovale. 
5. Mild global atrophy and white matter signal abnormality in a 
distribution suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease. 
6. No hemorrhage. 

Non-Contrast CT of Head (___): No acute intracranial 
process.

CTA H+N: CONCLUSION (___): Mild common carotid and internal 
carotid artery vascular calcifications with no hemodynamically 
significant stenosis or occlusion. Normal intracranial arterial 
tree.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ right handed woman with a past 
medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented 
for evaluation of new onset aphasia. MRI showed a L MCA stroke 
and 2 small infarcts in the L cerebellar and R temporal areas. 
The bilateral distribution of the infarcts in both the anterior 
and posterior circulation territory was suggestive of a 
cardioembolic or aortoembolic source. Given she has severe 
aortic atherosclerotic disease, it was felt an aortoembolic 
source was more likely. Her LDL was 96. She was discharged on 
aspirin 81 daily and atorvastatin 80 daily for secondary stroke 
prevention. No atrial fibrillation was documented while pt was 
on telemetry in the hospital. Echocardiogram did not show any 
cardiac source of embolus. She should continue to be monitored 
for atrial fibrillation with telemetry at rehab. She should have 
a Holter monitor placed as an outpatient after she is discharged 
from rehabilitation.

Of note, all anti-hypertensives were held at admission to allow 
for permissive HTN given pt's stroke. Metoprolol was restarted 
while in the hospital with SBP 120s in the last 24 hours prior 
to discharge. Therefore, valsartan, amlodipine and HCTZ were 
held at discharge. These medications can be restarted as 
tolerated while at rehab or as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  hypertension, hyperlipidemia 
(high lipids). 

We are changing your medications as follows:  
1) You should take Atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Please discontinue 
your home simvastatin.
2) You should take Aspirin 80 mg daily.

Additionally, your blood pressure medications have been adjusted 
as your blood pressure was not high in the last 24 hours prior 
to your discharge. You will be discharged on metoprolol only. 
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor regarding when to 
restart your other blood pressure medications.

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
