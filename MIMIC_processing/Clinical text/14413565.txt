Chief Complaint:
right sided weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed man with past medical
history of left MCA M1 severe stenosis with previous
presentations with transient ischemic attack in ___ with right
sided weakness who code stroke was called for acute onset
dysarthria and right sided weakness. 

His history and interpretation is provided by ___, his
daughter, who can be reached at ___. 

He was in his normal state of health today.  He reports no being
dehydrated or taking in less fluids than he normally does.  He
was walking his grandchildren home from school when he suddenly
noticed at about 4:30 ___ that his right arm and leg became weak
and felt numb.  He was able to walk home on his own. 

His daughter noticed that the right side of his face was weak 
and
that his voice did not sound normal when he arrived him.  EMS 
was
called and he was brought here.  ED activated code stroke for
NIHSS of 8 with points scored for facial weakness, dysarthria,
and right sided weakness.  

He had a NCHCT which did not show bleed and CTA head and neck
which redmonstrated prior left MCA M1 severe stenosis.  By the
time I examined him he was back in his room and had been flat 
for
some time.  He told me that he was feeling close to back to his
baseline.  His daughter said that his voice still did not sounds
quite the same.  I gave him an NIHSS of 1 with a soft call for
dysarthria.  We elected against TPA given the low NIHSS and
because his neurologic deficits were likely because of
hypoperfusion.

Imaging 
========
CTA head and neck ___ 
FINDINGS:  
  
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: 
An age-indeterminate left basal ganglia lacunar infarct is seen. 

  
There is no evidence of new infarction,intracranial 
hemorrhage,edema,ormass.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in 
size and configuration. 
  
There is mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus.  
The mastoid air cells,and middle ear cavities are clear. The 
visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable. 
  
CT PERFUSION ANALYSIS: 
CBF < 30% volume: 0 mL 
T-max > 6.0 s volume: 0 mL 
Mismatch volume: 0 mL 
  
  
CTA HEAD: 
There is worse severe focal narrowing of the distal left M1 
segment with 
patent distal run-off. 
  
Otherwise, the vessels of the circle of ___ and their 
principal 
intracranial branches appear normal without stenosis, occlusion, 
or aneurysm formation.  The dural venous sinuses are patent. 
  
  
CTA NECK: 
Atherosclerotic calcification is identified in the aortic arch 
(series 4, 
image 22, series 602, image 37).  Atherosclerotic changes of the 
carotid 
bifurcations are seen without narrowing of the internal carotid 
arteries, by NASCET criteria.  Atherosclerotic calcification is 
identified on the left vertebral artery at V1 segment (series 
602, image 39), with no evidence of stenosis, otherwise, the 
vertebral arteries appear normal with no evidence of stenosis or 
occlusion. 
  
OTHER: 
The visualized portion of the lungs are clear.  The visualized 
portion of the thyroid gland is within normal limits. There is 
no lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.  Degenerative changes of 
the cervical spine are seen.  A 4 mm cystic lesion of the base 
of the tongue (4:141) is unchanged. 
  
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute large territorial infarct or intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
2. Age-indeterminate left basal ganglia lacunar infarct. 
3. Worse severe focal narrowing of the distal left M1 segment 
with patent 
distal run-off. 
4. Atherosclerotic changes throughout the neck vessels, however, 
no stenosis or occlusion of the cervical arteries. 

MRI Brain w/o contrast ___
FINDINGS:  
Areas of restricted diffusion involving the left putamen and 
caudate are 
associated with FLAIR/T2 hyperintense signal, and are new 
compared to ___, compatible with acute infarcts (04: 
___.  There is no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.  No 
midline shift of structures.  Prominence of the ventricles and 
sulci is likely related to age-related involutional change.  
There is mild periventricular and subcortical white matter 
FLAIR/T2 hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but likely 
reflect the sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. 
Major vascular flow voids appear well preserved.  There is a 
focus of low signal on susceptibility images along the left 
middle cerebral artery (11:11) which could be suggestive of a 
thrombus. 
  
Paranasal sinuses are essentially clear.  The visualized globes 
are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
Acute left basal ganglia infarction without evidence of 
hemorrhagic 
conversion.  Likely thrombus in the distal portion of left M1 
segment. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed man with past medical 
history of left MCA M1 severe stenosis with previous 
presentations with transient ischemic attack in ___ with right 
sided weakness who presented with acute onset dysarthria and 
right sided weakness which rapidly improved from NIHSS 8 to 1 
(just dysarthria) found to have left MCA M1 stenosis that looks 
worse compared to previous.

#Left M1 stenosis, likely inchemia vs. TIA
CTA showed left M1 stenosis worsened from prior. Given concern 
for atherosclerosis as etiology and NIHSS 1, he was loaded to 
Plavix and started on maintenance Plavix in addition to aspirin 
per POINT trial. Initially, he was made HOB flat and fluids, but 
activity was liberalized as his exam was stable with sitting up. 
His exam remained stable with only subtle dysarthria, right 
facial droop and slight right pronator drift. MRI showed acute 
left basal ganglia infarction without evidence of hemorrhagic 
conversion and likely thrombosis in distal portion of left M1 
segment. Risk factors were notable for HgA1c 6.1, LDL 47, and 
TSH 4.0. He was discharged with speech and swallow followup for 
his dysarthria. 

#Mild thrombocytopenia: During admission patient had mild 
thrombocytopenia 140-133. Patient will follow up with PCP and 
have CBC re-checked to ensure platelets are stable. 

#Pre-diabetes: Hgba1c checked on admission was 6.1, patient 
pre-diabetic. Will work with PCP for lifestyle modifications and 
will monitor as an outpatient. 

#Chronic Hepatitis B: Patient was continued on home entecavir 
during admission. 

Transitional Issues

plates. At discharge mildly decreased to 133.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right sided weakness 
and slurring speech resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms. 
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 - atherosclerosis in the vessel in your brain 
 - Pre-diabetes 
  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
 - Take aspirin 81mg and Plavix 75mg daily for 3 months. On ___ 
stop taking Plavix and continue to take only aspirin.  

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

Please call speech to schedule outpatient speech therapy to help 
with your slurring when you speak. Call ___

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team
