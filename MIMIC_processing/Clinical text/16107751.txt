Imaging: 
___ CT head/neck: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or loss 
of
gray-white differentiation to suggest acute infarction. 
2. There is no stenosis, dissection, occlusion, or aneurysm
greater than 3 mm in the great vessels of the head or neck.

___ MRI brain:1.  Study is moderately degraded by motion. 

2. Acute to subacute infarction involving the posterior limb of
the right internal capsule/ globus pallidus. 
3. No intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift. 
4. Mild paranasal sinus disease. 

      
___ ___: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the 
right or left lower extremity veins.

___ MRV pelvis: 
MRV of the pelvis demonstrates no deep venous thrombosis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted with acute onset of dizziness, abnormal 
facial movement (unclear which side, Ms. ___ noted R facial 
abnormality, ED noted L facial droop), L hemiparesis and L 
neglect. Initial NIHSS 15. The left-sided neglect may
explain why she did not note these deficits.  This presentation 
was concerning for a right MCA syndrome.  As she was about to 
receive tPA, her symptoms spontaneously resolved and she was 
subsequently at her neurologic baseline throughout her 
admission. MRI revealed acute infarct of the posterior limb of 
the right internal capsule and also the globus pallidus. Suspect 
initial larger area of ischemia with spontaneous dissolution of 
presumed embolus. She may have had embolus to the right central 
retinal artery (explaining the transient loss of vision of the 
right eye). Given lack of vascular risk factors and 
distribution, there was concern for hypercoagulable state vs 
paradoxical embolus vs cardioembolus. TEE showed PFO. ___ and 
MRV pelvis showed no thrombus. She was discharged with ___ of 
hearts monitor after telemetry showed no evidence of 
tachyarrhythmia while inpatient. 
Hypercoagulable workup was sent. 

She was discharged on ASA 81. Oral contraceptives were stopped 
and patient instructed to use barrier methods. 

========================
Transitional Issues: 
[ ] She should never again receive estrogen-containing 
contraceptives. Progesterone-only methods are acceptable.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of abnormal facial 
movement and difficulty using your left side resulting from an 
ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a 
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  Thankfully, your symptoms resolved on their own, 
though you still have a residual small area of stroke in the 
right thalamus and basal ganglia. 

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
An abnormal connection between the left and right sides of the 
heart (patent foramen ovale, or PFO). This can lead to a 
paradoxical embolus that travels to the brain (instead of the 
lungs).

Your ultrasound of your legs did not show blood clots in the 
legs.
 
Your MRV of the pelvis was negative for any blood clots. 

Your labs to check for a blood clotting disorder are still 
pending.

We are changing your medications as follows:  
Start taking baby aspirin daily
STOP oral contraception (estrogen can increase risk of stroke). 
Use progesterone only method, IUD or barrier methods - discuss 
options with your gynecologist.
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
