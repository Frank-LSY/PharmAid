======================================================
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; OUTSIDE FILMS READ ONLY   
Reason: Second opinion request for OSH MRI/MRA

1. Examination is moderately degraded by motion.
2. Redemonstration of patient's known right pontine acute 
hemorrhage, compared
to same day noncontrast head CT.  Please note that underlying 
mass is not
excluded on the basis of this examination.
3. No evidence of acute infarction.
4. Paranasal sinus disease and nonspecific left mastoid fluid, 
as described.
5. A 3 x 1 mm linear outpouching emanating anteriorly from the 
anterior
communicating artery complex as described.  While finding may 
represent
fenestration, small aneurysm is not excluded on the basis of 
this examination.
6. Otherwise, grossly patent circle of ___ without definite 
evidence of
stenosis orocclusion.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old with history of untreated HTN and 
pre-DM who presented with dizziness and left hemibody sensory 
changes found to have right pontine hemorrhage. On presentation, 
his exam was notable for right NLFF, vertical skew, decreased 
sensation in left arm and leg consistent with a pontine process. 
Based on the description of this lesion on the MRI, it is most 
likely a hypertensive bleed in a cavernoma.

===============================================

#Right Pontine hemorrhage, likely hypertensive bleed, but a  
cavernoma is in the differential: Patient presented with acute 
onset of dizziness, gait unsteadiness and left hemibody 
numbness. The head CT and brain MRI confirmed a circumscribed 
right dorsolateral pontine hemorrhage. This is likely 
hypertensive given systolics >160 requiring a nicardipine gtt 
initially. Patient's exam at presentation was remarkable for 
fluent speech without dysarthria. Pupils are symmetric and 
reactive. There is subtle right eye ptosis as well as vertical 
skew. He complained of diplopia on right horizontal gaze which 
resolves with individual eye closure. He had left pronation 
without drift and he had normal strength and coordination. He 
had decreased sensation in left face arm and leg to pinprick, 
temperature. Prior to discharge, his exam remained stable except 
for resolved decreased sensation on the left side. Patient's 
blood pressure remained stable on captopril, which was 
transitioned to lisinopril 20 mg daily at the time of discharge. 
He was evaluated by ___ who recommended follow-up with outpatient 
___. Exam was stable on discharge although with smaller right 
palpebral fissure, slight left pronator drift, slight left 
dysmetria and some decreased cold sensation on left hand.

#Prior possible inferior infarct on EKG, stable and he reports 
prior noted with negative stress test: Troponin were negative, 
we recommend follow-up with PCP for consideration of cardiology 
consult.

#Pre-Diabetic: Patient's stroke labs were checked and A1c was 
found to be 6.1. Patient was counseled re diet.

#presumed OSA:
During this hospitalization, patient was noted to have 
desaturations to ___ to ___ briefly overnight. This led to a 
concern for obstructive sleep apnea. This was discussed with the 
patient, we recommend an outpatient sleep study and 
consideration CPAP if the study is positive.

=======================================================

Transitional issues :
[ ] Neurology: We recommend obtaining a repeat brain MRI with 
and without contrast with DTI sequences in three months. Patient 
should follow up with a neurologist, number for Atrius Neurology 
and ___ Neurology has been provided.

[ ] PCP: ___ was started doing this admission, please 
consider titration of medication based on patients blood 
pressure. Consider checking electrolytes in a few weeks after 
discharge.

[ ] PCP : ___ consider an out patient sleep study due to 
concern for obstructive sleep apnea.

[] NEUROSURGERY:
Please make an appointment for Neurosurgery follow-up in ___. ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness and left body 
sensory changes resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGE in the brain.

Brain bleed can have many different causes, so we assessed you 
for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having 
these. In order to prevent future bleeds, we plan to modify 
those risk factors. Your risk factors are:

<> high blood pressure

We are changing your medications as follows:
<> start taking lisionpril 20 mg daily
<> Since this medication can alter your electrolytes, discuss 
blood check with your PCP

<> We recommend a repeat MRI in 3 months with and without 
contrast and follow up with a neurologist. 

<> We also recommended that you get a sleep study done, your PCP 
can help arrange this. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
