Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of PCOS, GERD, 
who initially presented with severe RLQ/R thigh pain, found to 
have fever and leukocytosis and expanding skin erythema of RLE 
with concern for SSTI and cellulitis. Was initially started on 
broad spectrum antibiotics Vancomycin and Zosyn. Was narrowed to 
cefazolin given thought to have had cellulitis with lymphangitic 
spread. Was then de-escalated to PO kelfex with plan for 7 day 
course (___). 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Cellulitis - Patient initially presented with fever to 102, WBC 
19.2, and R thigh pain for one day duration which progressed to 
R sided abdominal pain. CT RLE and A/P at outside hospital did 
not show any evidence of gas otherwise with no acute process. 
Here was started on broad spectrum antibiotics Vancomycin and 
Zosyn in the ED given concern for SSTI and possible 
intra-abdominal process. Given reassuring CT A/P findings with 
no evidence of intra-abdominal infection Zosyn was subsequently 
discontinued. Had evidence of cellulitis with lymphangitic 
spread to proximal portion of right lower extremity. Was 
narrowed to cefazolin with clinical improvement on exam. She was 
subsequently narrowed to PO kelfex with plan for 7 day course 
(___) prior to discharge.
