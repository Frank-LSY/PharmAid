History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
___ yo F with anxiety and depression who was sent in by BU after 
calling counseling services expressing SI and almost attempting 
to drown herself earlier. Psychiatry was consulted for a safety 
evaluation. 
.
Patient states she has been having difficulty handling the 
academic rigors of college the past few weeks. She has few 
social supports and does not have any current psychiatric 
treaters in the area. This has led to increased SI for the past 
few weeks. They have not had a formed plan most of the time. 
Today, she was running (which she does to help calm down the SI) 
along the Espl___ when suddenly she found herself at the edge 
of the ___ and wanting to jump in to drown herself. She was 
able to talk herself out of it and kept running. 10 min later 
she found herself on the dock with her head almost in the water 
and got
scared and ran back to her dorm immediately. This was concerning 
for her because she didn't even realize she was so close to 
attempting suicide. She feels the SI is becoming more intrusive 
and her attempts to avoid it are not working. She went back to 
her dorm and called her best friend from high school who 
suggested that she call the counseling center, which she did, 
who then sent her here. 
.
Patient has also had lots of thoughts of self injury. She has 
frequent thoughts of cutting her wrists (not for SA), cutting 
her Achilles tendon, or mutilating her vagina. She is disturbed 
by these. She thinks she has these thoughts because she deserves 
punishment and pain. 
.
Patient states she has done IFS therapy (Internal family systems 
model) as well as EMDR (Eye movement desensitization and 
reprocessing). She is very concerned that "she is not her inner 
self. I am worried that I cannot be that person, and if I am not 
that person what is it all worth? What do I do with that?" 
Patient states this is part of the IFS therapy. She is also 
struggling with her religion. She has gone from atheist, 
agnostic, ___, universal spiritual and back and forth. She 
is very distraught about what she believes in. 
.
