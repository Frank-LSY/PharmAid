History of Present Illness:
HPI: 
___ male, previously healthy, presenting with high 
fever,
and pruritic erythematous rash.  Patient reported that several
weeks ago, he developed a boil on his right chest, which he
subsequently popped.  Approximately 1 week ago, the boil
continued to drain pus, increased in size, "appear infected." 
Patient initially presented to his PCP ___ ___, and was
prescribed Bactrim.  During that time, the patient reported a
temperature to 104, which improved within a few days.  3 days
prior to presentation, the patient reported that he "felt sick,"
and presented to an outside hospital, where he was prescribed
Keflex for left middle ear infection.  Patient began to have a
pruritic generalized erythematous rash initially over his chest
and torso.  On the morning of admission, patient noted that 
after
he took a shower, the rash spread across his whole body and he
"looked like a tomato".

In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.1 102 167/97 16 100% on
RA.
Labs were notable for a CBC with a WBC of 3.7 (70% neutrophils,
19% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 6.8% eosinophils), BMP WNL, LFTs
with ALT 207, AST 191 146, T bili 0.3, lactate elevated at 2.5. 
ProBNP 44.  UA notable for protein and ketones.
Physical exam was notable for mild erythematous eruption over
bilateral upper extremities, chest, back, and a healing skin
lesion on his right upper chest, with inferior auricular
lymphadenopathy.
Patient was evaluated by dermatology who felt that his syndrome
was overall consistent with DRESS.  She received IV Zofran, IV
Benadryl, 100 mg doxy, 1000 mg of acetaminophen, normal saline,
prednisone 80 mg Ã—1.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient tells the story as above.
He reports that he first became ill approximately ___ weeks ago. 

During that time, he was noted to have high fevers, up to 104,
and he went to a clinic.  Reportedly, the doctor told him "his
spleen was enlarged" which was assessed via physical exam,
without radiographic evidence.  He took antibiotics at that 
time,
but he does not know which one. He also reports that he was told
he had a viral infection. Reportedly, he was tested for mono
during that time, and he believes this came back negative.  At
that visit, he was also told that his liver enzymes were
abnormal, but reports no further testing. Review of pharmacy
records show that in early ___, he took a course of penicillin
and most likely dexamethasone, so it is unclear if this is the
episode he is mentioning. He did not have a rash at that time. 

He reports that in the last month, he has had increasing fatigue
and lack of energy.  He tells a story as above, beginning with a
boil, with antibiotic history as above.  However he notes, that
whenever he has high fevers, he feels extremely unwell,
associated with headaches, chills, rigors.  She reports that the
lymph nodes in his neck swell to the point that is extremely
painful, and seems to be associated both with this incident as
well as his incident of fevers approximately ___ months ago.  He
reports some nausea without vomiting that occurs with these
episodes. On the day of admission, the patient was taking both
Bactrim and Keflex as prescribed.

He otherwise denies chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria,
diarrhea, bloody bowel movements.  She otherwise denies sick
contacts, recent travel, recent hiking or outdoor activity, or
recent tick bites.  He reports that his family recently traveled
to ___, but he "stayed in hotel" and did not
participate in outdoor activities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: ___ otherwise healthy presenting with erythroderma, 
fevers, and lymphadenopathy with recent outpatient treatment 
with Bactrim and Keflex, found to have transaminitis, with 
clinical presentation concerning for possible DRESS, however, 
with over 1 month of fevers and lymphadenopathy at home.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:

#Fevers
#LAD: Patient's differential was broad at admission. Initially 
there was a concern for DRESS and he was given 1 dose of 
steroids before they were discontinued. He received a CT 
neck/chest and abd/pelvis notable for cervical and axillary LAD. 
He was febrile with a Tmax of 101.8 shortly after admission, 
weakness/fatigue, an erythematous rash diffusely on his chest, 
and painful cervical LAD. Differential was broad and 
rheumatology, oncology and ID were consulted. Patient had an 
extensive workup sent outlined in the discharge summary. He was 
started on doxycycline out of a suspicion for tick borne 
illnesses, particularly anaplasmosis (recently traveled to ___) 
and for a L chest skin infection. Patient improved significantly 
with resolution of his palpable LAD. Notable positive labs 
included an elevated ferritin in the 2000s, LDH that trended 
downward, CRP of 32, and leukopenia to 1.8 which improved. 
-will treat with doxycycline for 10 days 
-f/u EBV, CMV,lyme/babesia/anaplasmosis serologies, HTLV
-f/u SPEP, UPEP, immunoglobulins, protein/creatinine urine 
- Mupirocin BID topically to the drained abscess on right chest

# Transaminitis: Patient presenting with elevated LFTs and a
hepatocellular pattern, with ALT of 207 and AST of 191 mild
elevation of alk phos. Given diffuse erythematous rash as above
and ongoing fever, transaminitis could be consistent with DRESS,
however, in speaking with the patient, the transaminitis has 
been
present for at least one month and was commented on by his PCP. 
Coagulation factors not yet drawn in the ED. No other evidence
for asterixis for worsening liver failure. CT abd/pelvis 
unremarkable, liver function tests stably elevated. 
- negative HIV, hepatitis panel

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You presented after 4 months of systemic symptoms including high 
grade fevers, lymphadenopathy and abnormal liver enzymes. We 
were initially concerned about an infectious or rheumatologic 
process and we are still concerned about an underlying condition 
that may have been complicated by an overlying infection that is 
now being treated with doxycycline. You have 8 more days of 
doxycycline to complete. 

Please follow up with the ID, rheumatology and hematology 
doctors as ___ outpatient to get more information about your lab 
test results. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you, 
Your ___ Care Team
