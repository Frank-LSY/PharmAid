History of Present Illness:
___ male with history of hypertension diabetes who
presented to OSH with left-sided chest pain with radiation to 
the
back, found to have an elevated troponin and transferred here 
for
further evaluation and management.

The patient reports that he was at rest and developed chest pain
in his central chest. It initially remitted on its own. Then it
came back, spread across his chest and went to his back. It
lasted from ___ pm. Later that night it came back again around 
6
pm. It was non-radiating chest pain, he had no sweating, no jaw
pain, no arm pain, he had no nausea or vomiting. 

A similar situation occurred ___ years ago. At that point he was
admitted to ___ for evaluation and had a negative
stress test. This was in the setting of stress. The patient
reports increased stress again recently with the death of his 
Son
from an MI about 2 weeks ago. His father also passed away in his
___ from an MI.

ECG was notable for sinus rhythm, no elevations, depressions, 
but
a RBBB. He had some non-specific T wave changes. 

He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. At the OSH he had
normal VS and an elevated trop to 0.053 that decreased to 0.04
here. He had an elevated lipase to 128 and a Tbili to 1.09. WBC
was mildly elevated to 11.46. WBC continued to uptrend during
admission to 13.2. 

He had a CTA chest to rule out a dissection that showed
centrilobular emphysema, 4 mm and 3 mm nodules, focal 
indentation
within the posterior wall of the proximal descending thoracic
aorta could represent a focal non-penetrating ulcer within
atheromatous plaque or simply a takeoff of an intercostal 
artery.
No PE. 

He was treated with a full dose aspirin and heparin gtt. 

On the floor he endorses the above and notes that he is chest
pain free.

size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with inferolateral
and anterolateral hypokinesis (see schematic) and 
preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. The

cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal for gender with mildly dilated
ascending aorta. The aortic arch diameter is normal. There is no

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of hypertension diabetes who 
presented to OSH with left-sided chest pain with radiation to 
the back, found to have NSTEMI with diffuse CAD on 
catheterization. 

#NSTEMI
#Coronary artery disease
Patient had chest pain, small troponin leak, and wall motion 
abnormality on TTE in LAD distribution consistent with Type I 
NSTEMI. CTA was negative for PE. Cardiac catheterization showed 
multivessel disease, notably 70% stenosis of proximal LAD, 70% 
stenosis of ___ diagonal, and 100% stenosis of proximal RCA, 
though there was no clear culprit lesion for event. Medical 
management was continued, including ASA 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 
mg, Lisinopril 40 mg, and atenolol 25 mg. Future workup for CABG 
may be warranted if patient has recurrent chest pain or ischemic 
events. 

#Elevated lipase
Transient elevation to 87, with resolved on repeat. No history 
of abdominal pain or vomiting. 

#HLD
Continued atorvastatin 80 mg. TC 117 and LDL calc 23 during 
admission.

#DM
Oral hypoglycemics held during admission and restarted on 
discharge. 

Transitional Issues:
[] Emphysematous lung changes noted on CTA. No dyspnea or 
hypoxia during admission and patient was able to ambulate 
without difficulty. Consider outpatient PFTs if symptomatic.
[] 4 mm and 3 mm nodules within the right upper and right middle 
lobes noted on CTA. For incidentally detected multiple solid 
pulmonary nodules smaller than 6mm, no CT follow-up is 
recommended in a low-risk patient, and an optional CT follow-up 
in 12 months is recommended in a high-risk patient. 
[] Given multi-vessel disease, consider cardiac surgery 
evaluation for potential CABG if CAD continues to be 
symptomatic. 
 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
1. Lisinopril 40 mg PO DAILY 
2. Atenolol 25 mg PO DAILY 
3. Januvia (SITagliptin) 100 mg oral DAILY 
4. MetFORMIN XR (Glucophage XR) 500 mg PO BID

in the coronary arteries of the heart. 
-The cardiologists decided the best course of action was to 
continue medical management of your heart disease, and to 
monitor your symptoms going forward.
