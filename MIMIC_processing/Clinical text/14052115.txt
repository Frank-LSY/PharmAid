History of Present Illness:
Per Dr. ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry Consult note:

"This is a ___ single, domiciled, unemployed, male 
student from ___ with reported history of 
depressive episodes, no hospitalizations, no past medical 
history coming in for suicidal ideation.

The patient was a poor historian, presenting in a very 
tangential manner throughout his history. His mother was present 
in the emergency room and available for collateral after the 
initial interview.

When asked what brought him in, the patient stated, "I've been 
sad and anxious, and embarrassed to exist since I was ___ or ___." 
When redirected to the immediate cause for his presence in the 
emergency department the patient states that he was having 
suicidal thoughts in the setting of returning to school. This is 
the second time he has started as a freshman at ___ 
___ and he is concerned that he has chosen an educational 
focus that will not be productive way to live his life. He goes 
on to state, "I am attached to the industry but I play classical 
guitar and there is no place for me in the music business, but 
there are too many people working everywhere, homeless people 
all over the place who graduated from ___." He then 
reiterated that he was feeling suicidal because he is back in 
___ and at ___ and he feels "like everyone here is a 
___

Currently he denies SI, HI, AVH. When asked if he ever had a 
plan, the patient states "I would think about it but then I 
would think about my parents and then it would stop." 

When asked about stressors he notes numerous stressors, 
comparing them to a "building on fire." He goes on to state that 
his stressors include, "having to go to school, having to go 
out, this interaction between [this clinician] and me, the idea 
that I want to help myself but I do not have the energy to do 
anything. My body feels like a brick." 

He also noted a recent death of an ex-girlfriend, named ___, 
"spelled with an e-y even though she is not ___ She was 
awful and manipulative. I was with her for ___ years and developed 
a sense of worthlessness while I was with her." They became a 
couple when the patient was ___ and the girlfriend was ___ and 
broke up ___ years later. According to the patient, she died 
recently in a, "freak accident," while the girlfriend was 
sitting with her legs hanging out of an open freight train. When 
the track switched, her dress was caught and she was dragged 
under and crushed. This clinician is unable to corroborate the 
story. The patient states that shortly before the ex-girlfriend 
died, the patient saw his ex-girlfriend and cheated on his 
current girlfriend with ___. He then reports, "flipping 
out," on ___ shouting that she made him "cheat on the only 
person who really cared for him." While the patient noted that 
this was a significant stressor, he was unable to characterize 
how the death of ___ affected him beyond "shock."

With regard to depressive symptoms, the patient states that he 
has experienced episodes of "sadness" since the age of ___ years 
old. He is unclear how long these episodes lasted but feels the 
depression came and went, and worsened when people were ___ 
to him. He does endorse a depressed mood, anhedonia, and he 
states that his ability to derive joy from his life stopped when 
he no longer had an ability to "achieve spontaneous erections in 
the morning." He states that his sleeping pattern has changed 
and he will go to sleep as soon as he returns home but finds 
himself waking up at 5 in the morning very often. He denies any 
appetite or weight changes. States that he is able to 
concentrate but he is having memory difficulties. He attributes 
his memory difficulties to having smoked a lot of cannabis from 
the ages of ___. Regarding his memory difficulties he states 
that he is "losing faith in [his] mind I am getting stupid, and 
I don't remember things."

With regard to anxiety the patient states that he constantly has 
ruminating thoughts but also has brief episodes of 
lightheadedness, palpitations, nausea.

The patient denies auditory or visual hallucinations, however he 
reports a belief that his roommate is a cannibal. He states that 
he has this belief because of the way his walls are painted. It 
appears to the patient as if, "somebody took a hatchet to 
someone else's head and the blood flew on the wall, and that 
blood was painted over with white paint on the wall." Patient 
states that he has nowhere else to go when asked why he 
continues to live with a man who he believes to be a cannibal, 
though he did also state that he is concerned his roommate will 
kill him. When asked for rationale the patient stated because 
"am a spoiled brat." And went on a tangent about how he relies 
heavily on support from his mother. Also noted that he will more 
than ___ times per day hear someone call his name while walking 
around town. 

The patient denies symptoms of mania such as distractibility, 
erratic behavior, grandiosity, flight of ideas, increased 
activity, decreased need for sleep, or talkativeness/pressured 
speech. "

In the ED, patient remained in good behavioral control. He did 
not receive any medications.

On interview today, patient shares a similar narrative as above. 
He notes that you "may need more paper to take this all down." 
He reports that since moving to ___ to re-enter ___ for 
the second time, he has been more stressed, thinking " all these 
people are frauds, and ___ wannabes". He reports that he 
feels hatred and disdain for schooling in general and has always 
had issues with the day to day expectations of school. He 
reports distress in taking something that he used to enjoy and 
turning it in to something that he does not like, by making it 
more academic. He also discusses that over the summer he went 
home to talk to his ex-girlfriend ___ (who he dated when he 
was ___, and who he felt manipulated him and "had him in a 
yoke"). He notes he went to confront her about the pain she had 
caused him growing up, and rather they ended up "hooking up". 
After this he "let her have it". At this point he was seeing his 
current girlfriend ___, so he was distressed that he was 
unfaithful. Later in the summer a friend from home called and 
informed him that ___ had died in a freak accident. He notes 
after this incident he found he had a lot of anger towards 
___ "she won again", which he finds distressing and also 
some guilt that in some way he caused this accident. He relates 
this of part of a reason he came in, however denies having 
intrusive thinking about this event on the day to day. 

He reports that prior to presentation he had low mood with some 
degree of anxiety, as well as hypersomnia with interrupted 
sleep, avoidance of school work and difficulty with completing 
tasks, and recurrent passive suicidal ideation recently. The was 
worse since his arrival to school 3 weeks ago. He denies any 
suicidal plan or intent. He reports that was reaching up out to 
his mother "a lot" for help reporting he has been calling ___ 
times at least daily. He does note approximately 1 week period 
of resuming cannabis use (last used 3 days ago) prior to 
presentation. Prior to this he was only using "occasionally" and 
last used regularly this year. He denies any other recurrent 
substance use. At this time, the patient endorses a lot of 
guilt, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness about his 
feelings about being able to make it through the semester in 
___. He notes that he feels that being at ___ is a 
"punishment" for how he approached his life growing up, "I could 
have done all the right things in the past to prevent this." 
When patient is feeling more distressed, he also notes he has 
paranoid thinking that he later thinks is "extreme" including 
the notion that his roommate is a "cannibal". 

At this time, patient continues to endorse feelings of guilt, 
helplessness, and worthlessness. He denies any suicidal ideation 
or thoughts of harming himself (last self harm episode was 
approx ___. He denies current or past auditory or visual 
hallucinations. He reports that he continues to have issues with

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Legal/Safety:
Mr. ___ refused to sign a conditional voluntary agreement and 
was admitted on a ___ on day of admission. That evening 
patient signed a CV, however this was rejected due to concern of 
patient's lack of understanding about his current presentation, 
ongoing irritability, and refusal to accept or engage in 
treatment. Patient later became more engaged in treatment and 
signed a conditional voluntary which was accepted; he also 
signed a 3 day notice that expired on ___. Of note, despite 
some intermittent irritability, patient maintained his safety 
throughout his hospitalization and did not require physical or 
chemical restraints. 
.
#. Psychiatric: Depression, emotional lability
- Mr. ___ is a ___ single, domiciled, unemployed, 
male student from ___ with self-reported 
history of depressive episodes, organizational difficulties, 
cannabis use, no hospitalizations or suicide attempts and no 
past medical history who self-presented to the ___ ED for 
suicidal ideation, and demonstrating odd behavior and paranoid 
thinking. On initial presentation, patient reported long 
standing depressive mood symptoms, auditory hallucinations, 
paranoid/bizarre delusions, and a long history of intermittent 
substance use with a focus on cannabis. Collateral on admission 
was notable for concern for the patient's daily functioning, and 
ability to remain safe in the community. 
- Mr. ___ presentation is complex and given history of 
school difficulties, there may be a component of low distress 
tolerance as a result of underlying learning disability or 
possible autism spectrum disorder, especially in light of 
possible diagnosis of Asperger's as a child per his mother, and 
concrete thought process with evidence of poor mentalization. 
This may interplay with adjustment disorder given multiple 
recent significant events and life changes which have been 
distressing for the patient. Additionally, given reports of 
depressed mood with problems with schooling, low self esteem, 
feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, hypersomnia and 
occasional passive SI, and increasing irritability, affective 
disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder could also be 
considered. Lastly, patient does report some vague paranoid 
thinking, and seems concrete in his thinking concerning for 
possible psychotic component to his presentation, however given 
its temporal association with marijuana use, and the fact that 
this resolved in the absence of cannabis use, makes a degree of 
substance induced psychosis most likely.
- During his hospitalization patient was started on risperidone 
0.5 mg QHS for irritability, and paranoid thinking. Patient 
tolerated initiation of this medication well, and without side 
effects and with some apparent improvement in his irritability. 
- He had intense periods of irritability throughout his 
admission, however was generally able to self regulate and did 
not require physical or chemical restraints. Patient attended 
occasional groups with variable participation, however was more 
engaged with treatment throughout his admission. He engaged 
appropriately with his peers on the unit. 
- On discharge, patient was set up with intensive outpatient 
program in the evenings, to continue to work on coping skills 
and distress tolerance. Additionally, patient was counseled to 
stop smoking marijuana as this can worsen his mood, increase 
paranoia, and impair his ability to tolerate distress. 
-  At discharge, patient reports improvement in mood, and 
hopefulness for his future. He denies any passive or active 
suicidal thinking. He denies any significant paranoia or 
perceptual disturbances. 
.
#. Cannabis use disorder:
- Patient with ongoing cannabis use prior to presentation. 
Patient was counseled on the negative effects of cannabis use 
and the recommendation to remain substance free at discharge. He 
was scheduled with follow up to continue cannabis use 
counseling..
