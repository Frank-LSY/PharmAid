Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you. As you know you were admitted 
to rule out TB. At ___ you had a CT scan which was 
read as "cavitary mass ___ the right upper lobe which may be 
related to cavitating pneumonia vs granulomatous infection". On 
arrival here you were started on an antibiotic called augmentin. 
You will need to remain on this for three weeks. You had three 
sputum cultures sent which are negative for TB. They did show 
mixed bacteria, we are waiting for the final speciation. As we 
discussed it is important that you have another CT scan after 
you complete treatment to ensure the area resolves and that if 
it doesn't you see a pulmonologist (lung specialist). 

You should discuss this with your primary care doctor on follow 
up tomorrow. 

It was a pleasure caring for you, 
Your ___ Doctors
