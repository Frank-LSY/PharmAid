Per ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry Consult
note:

___ is a ___ year old male with PMH of self-reported
depression, anxiety and ADHD who was brought in by EMS after his
girlfriend called ___ due to receiving suicidal text messages
from him. He states that everything was a huge misunderstanding
and taking his words out of context in order to "interpret it
incorrectly." He reports that ever since he let his girlfriend
know that he takes medications for his depression and anxiety, 
he
reports that she has been more on edge with him and not
understanding where he is coming from and calling him lazy when
he feels depressed. He endorses hypersomnia and amotivation and
intermittent suicidal ideation, but denies having any plan or
intent. He states that after having an argument with his
girlfriend last ___ night, he texted her a provocative
statement stating, "What if I had hung myself?" due to his
irritation that she had not texted or called him for an entire
day after their argument. He endorses that he sent this message
not to state that he would actually try to hurt himself, but in
order to make a point and to help her understand how he feels.

He
also notes intermittent anxiety about executing tasks. "

did not require any chemical or physical restraints.

Per Dr. ___ ___ ED note 
"He made comments that if he had
to go to jail, he would kill himself, and is facing ___ year
sentence after selling to undercover detective in ___. He
acknowledged to ___ he had the suicidal thoughts but claims he
would never have acted on the thoughts. While here he has
minimized all recent events. He says to me that he took FMLA
because he was too lazy to work and couldn't get any more
Adderall, but also stated that he took the leave because his
depression and anxiety were so severe. He has been treated for
depression and anxiety as an outpatient and is on Zoloft, Xanax
bid prn, and Adderall tid which patient acknowledges he has been
abusing. Says he only used 30 tabs of Xanax over a few months 
and
did not take daily. Psychiatrist noted many early refills and
concerns for abuse of both Xanax and Adderall. Patient not well
connected to outpatient psychiatrist per his report. He says he
had already broken up with gf and it's no big deal that they're
not going to be living together, but can't explain then why he
made the suicidal comments if not in setting of breakup. Patient
acknowledges disliking job. He was supposed to go back to work
last week but asked for an extension. He acknowledges he used
adderall to get through the job he hated. Inconsistent remarks
about how everything would have been fine if we would have just
not held him in the ED when he was supposed to go back to work
yesterday, but can't explain why if everything was so great he
was making suicidal statements other than that "I was just high
on Adderall". Denies ever making suicidal statements when on
Adderall in past. Says video he sent gf referring to ___ member related suicide was more about depression; he says 
he
wanted her to understand how depressed he was and to prove he
wasn't "lazy", but then again backtracks and says he wasn't all
that depressed."  

On interview today, patient discusses that sending the text
message as "juvenile, stupid, super silly." He notes when he
re-reads the text message it makes him uncomfortable, and if a
family member sent him the text message he would have acted the
same way his girlfriend did. He denies having suicidal ideation,
intent, or plan. He states he is "too much of a coward" to 
commit
suicide. He also states he would not want to hurt his family or
friends. He describes being anxious and depressed for the last 3
months, which led to a strain on his relationship. He notes he
reached out to his girlfriend prior to to the suicidal texts
asking her to talk, but she wasn't responding to his text
messages, at which point he wrote the suicidal text message. He
notes being on adderral at the time. 

Regarding adderral he notes misusing it for over ___ yrs, and he
states he specifically got care from his psychiatrist bc he had
heard he would give him a prescription for adderral. Patient
describes several consequences from adderral namely sexual side
effects, increased anxiety, poor sleep, and impulsive behavior.
He describes sometimes "blacking out" on adderral and not
remembering conversations he had via text message. He states he
does feel he has a problem with adderral, and he wants treatment
for his stimulant use. He states he does not ___ any barriers
to stopping because he has been able to stop tobacco easily in
the past. 

Interview is recursive to patient stating he wants care, but he
feels like he should not be at the psych unit involuntary. He
states that "someone like me should not end up in an asylum". He
continues that he was making 6 figures. Denies HI, AVH, and
delusional thought content.

and collateral contacts reporting recent suicidal thoughts and 
statements by text along with psychosocial stressors of legal 
difficulties, recent unemployment and financial instability and 
social isolation.  On admission to the emergency department the 
patient denied suicidal ideation, and continue to do so for the 
remainder of his admission.  He also denied depressive symptoms, 
stating that anxiety was the most prominent symptom he 
experienced, for which he was on sertraline 150 mg p.o. daily.  
The treatment team discussed with the patient increasing his

medication, with this patient.   We discussed the patient's 
right to decide whether to take this medication as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team.  
 
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon concerning 
collateral consisting of suicidal ideation in the setting of 
medication mis-use, substance abuse and multiple 
psychosocial-legal stressors. His static factors noted at that 
time ADD, male gender, recent dissolution of a relationship, 
single relationship status, recent financial/job loss, pending 
legal charges, recent estrangement from psychiatrist given 
concern for misuse of prescriptions.

His modifiable risk factors included stimulant misuse, 
impulsivity, anxiety, and homelessness. The modifiable risk 
factors were addressed during hospitalization via medication 
management, psychotherapeutic intervention, and aftercare 
coordination.  

Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including responsibility to family, 
reality-testing ability, and support of parents, medication 
adherence, lack of suicidal ideation, future-oriented viewpoint. 
 Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness.
