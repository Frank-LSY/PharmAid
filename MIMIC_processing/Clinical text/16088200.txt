-Serum tox: Negative 

___ CXR (___):

represents a
small calcified granuloma or less likely a vessel on end. 
Otherwise, the lung
fields are clear. There is no pneumothorax, fracture or 
dislocation.  Limited
assessment of the abdomen is unremarkable. No acute 
cardiopulmonary abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
SAFETY: Patient was placed on 15 minute checks on admission and 
remained here on that level of observation throughout. She was 
unit restricted. There were no acute safety issues during this 
hospitalization.

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC:
#Psychosis: On admission, patient was isolative, guarded but 
maintained behavioral control. During hospitalization, patient 
was evaluated and found to have tangential, disordered thoughts 
with some loose associations as well as delusions. Patient was 
perseverative with somatic symptoms, including hand and leg 
discoloration, facial rash, and later arm weakness. On admission 
exam, patient appeared markedly disorganized, paranoid, with 
tangential thought process, +LOA, perseverative on somatic 
symptoms, irritable labile affect, and pressured speech. Patient 
was restarted on Olanzapine ___ in ___ ___ and admitted 
2 days later to the inpatient psychiatry unit, where Olanzapine 
was continued without interruption.

Initial interviews on the inpatient psychiatry unit were 
challenging due to marked somatic preoccupation, paranoia, 
tangentiality, and delusional content. However, patient 
demonstrated improvement in psychotic and affective symptoms, 
and gradually tolerated and engaged more in team interviews. 
Patient was able to sit for full interview with the team, though 
required redirection and encouragement to continue with 
interview. Patient demonstrated improved thought process and 
organization; however, continued to demonstrate irritability and 
marked paranoia. Throughout patient's hospitalization, even 
after significant improvement in symptoms, patient reported 
others were recording her, patient frequently stated she felt 
wronged and slighted by staff on the unit. Patient's delusions 
appeared to be longstanding, and exacerbated by recent affective 
symptoms. Patient's presentation is most consistent with 
decompensated primary psychotic disorder, most likely 
schizoaffective disorder. Differential diagnosis also includes 
BPAD w/ psychosis. It is also possible that substance use 
contributed to patient's symptom, though patient reported rare 
("medical") cannabis use prior to presentation. Patient's 
discharge psychiatric medication regimen included Olanzapine 20 
mg PO daily and Olanzapine 5 mg PO daily PRN anxiety.

Patient identified past trauma as triggering. Due to 
destabilizing nature of past trauma, CPVR was consulted and 
participated in patient's care.

MEDICAL:

significant for unremarkable CBC, BMP, UA, TSH, B12, folate, 
thiamine, LFTs as well as negative serum and urine tox screens. 
RPR was non-reactive.

# Right lung density: ___ workup (___) significant for CXR 
with circumscribed punctate density at the right lung base, 
small calcified granuloma vs. less likely a vessel on end 
(___). On exam, VSS and lung exam was CTAB, with 
comfortable breathing.  Given patient's exposure to possible TB 
(homeless shelters), CXR finding, and many somatic complaints 
(notably no continued respiratory complaints past admission), a 
PPD was placed for concern of latent TB. Patient's PPD read 0 mm 
induration on ___. At discharge, patient was instructed to 
follow up with her PCP ___ 2 weeks or sooner if respiratory 
of new symptoms.

issues. Following some symptom stabilization, patient began to

shelter at this time after arguments with others, which is not 
unusual for her. Patient frequently appears hypomanic. Patient's 
baseline includes some disorganization. Patient demonstrates 
limited insight into own symptoms and mental health problems. 
Patient is typically paranoid, evasive, guarded, and somewhat 
grandiose, though superficially pleasant. At most recent visit

risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medication, with this patient. We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as

with the treatment team, and I answered the patient's questions.

risk factors include chronic and severe mental illness, active 
psychiatric decompensation, active cannabis abuse, lack of day 
structure, history of legal involvement (alleged significant 
severe harm to son during previous bipolar decompensation, 
single status, history of noncompliance (with both medications 
and active engagement with treater), evidence of impulsivity, 
constricted psychosocial support, and homelessness, network 
place patient at moderate to high risk of harm to 
self/inadequate self-care. Protective factors include help 
seeking behavior and established outpatient psychiatrist, and no 
past suicide attempt.

PROGNOSIS:
Fair- While patient is prone to relapse into mania/psychosis 
given nature of her illness, h/o noncompliance, and prolonged 
functional decline, patient appears motivated to obtain 
treatment, is help seeking, and demonstrated significant 
improvement in stabilization while hospitalized.
