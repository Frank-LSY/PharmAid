History of Present Illness:
HPI:
___ is a ___ left handed man who presents to the ED 
with vision changes. Over the past few months he has had ___ 
episodes of loss of vision focus while at rest. Most recently 
the recurred ___ afternoon. He was at work walking around his 
office when he noticed sudden onset vision change as if "looking 
through water." He noticed that if he was looking at a word, he 
couldn't see the first letter. He tested himself by looking at 
his finger and noticed that the left field of his vision was out 
in both eyes. This improved in ___ minutes and his vision was 
95%+ back to normal. Since then, one eye has felt a little 
strange and he took some Tylenol for a mild HA, which is not 
unusual for him. 

He made an appointment to see his PCP ___. There, he was found 
to be in new onset rapid atrial fibrillation. 

Two weeks ago he was doing intervals on the stair master and 
noticed he was easily SOB, which is atypical for him. This 
resolved after a few minutes and his exercise tolerance then 
returned to baseline.

He saw his PCP today who found him to be in new onset atrial 
fibrillation and he was referred to the ED. On ED exam, he has a 
right homonymous hemianopia. Neurology consulted for stroke 
evaluation. 

For his atrial fibrillation, he presented with RVR to 150s, got 
1 IV dose and subsequent PO dilt with good effect and rate 
control.
 
Review of Systems: Reports some mild balance difficulties for a 
couple weeks. He gets some numbness in his hands at times 
(chronic).
The pt denies diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, 
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties 
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, 
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or 
retention. The pt denies recent fever or chills.  No recent 
weight loss. Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest 
pain or palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or 
bladder habits.  No dysuria. Denies rash.

IMAGING: 

IMAGING:
CTA head/neck ___:
"1. No stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm greater than 
3 mm in the great vessels of the head or neck.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or loss of gray-white 
differentiation to suggest acute infarction.
3. Final read pending 3D reformations."

MRI HEAD:  
1. No acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Probable chronic small vessel microangiopathy.
 

EKG: afib at 117 bpm, minimal ST depressions
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a healthy ___ gentleman who was 
admitted to the ___ Stroke Neurology service for transient 
visual obscurations which had already resolved during our 
Neurologic evaluation on admission. These symptoms occurred in 
the setting of newly diagnosed A-fib (seen on EKG at his PCP's 
office) which was concerning for TIA. 

 Imaging revealed no major vessel occlusions on CTA. MRI did not 
show any acute strokes, however the FLAIR did show small 
punctate foci in the frontal lobes which could suggest prior 
embolic strokes. In any case, given his new diagnosis of afib, 
he will be anticoagulated to prevent cardioembolic stroke with 
Eliquis (5mg BID). Mr. ___ was monitored on telemetry during 
his hospitalization at ___. He was started on rate controlling 
medication and had stable heart rates throughout his stay. He 
remained hemodynamically stable. He also had resolution of his 
neurologic symptoms and no further physical exam changes. Given 
the likely etiology of his transient symptoms, we agreed to have 
the rest of his stroke work up to be done in the outpatient 
setting. Specifically, he will have a trans-thoracic 
echocardiogram (TTE) in the ___ outpatient echo lab. In 
addition, he is to see a Cardiologist (PCP to refer him for one) 
given that he has new onset a-fib and has been started on 
eliquis. 
 
In terms of other stroke risk factors, Mr. ___ LDL returned 
at 104 which is mildly elevated. Given his TIA and elevated LDL, 
he was started on atorvastatin 20mg and discharged on this dose. 
Initially, for atrial fibrillation, Mr. ___ was started on 
diltiazem 30mg TID, however given the interactions this 
medication has with eliquis and atorvastatin, he was switched to 
metoprolol 50mg BID and was sent home on this medication. This 
medication can be titrated as needed for better heart rate 
control. No acute complications or other significant events 
occurred during this hospitalization. 

TRANSITIONS OF CARE ISSUES: 
1. Patient to follow-up with Dr. ___ (stroke Attending) 
within ___ months time (Patient to call the office to schedule 
appointment as patient was discharged over the weekend) 
2. Patient to START taking eliquis 5mg BID 
3. Patient to START taking metoprolol 50mg BID
4. Patient to START taking atorvastatin 20mg daily 
5. Advised patient on increased risk of bleeding with eliquis 
and to be cautious while performing high risk activities such as 
skiing and bicycling. 
6. Patient to follow up with his PCP ___ 1 week.
7. Patient to have an outpatient TTE (echocardiogram) early next 
week (___), order has been placed 
8. Patient to also follow up with a Cardiologist (PCP to refer)
9. Patient to STOP taking Adderall   as this can exacerbate the 
heart rate/ fib. Patient to take all other home medications as 
prescribed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted for an episode of transient vision blurring/ 
loss of part of your visual field. Your PCP found you to be in 
new onset atrial fibrillation which is an abnormal heart rhythm. 
Given that this new heart rhythm can cause blood clots, there 
was a risk of you having had a stroke. MRI of you brain 
thankfully did not reveal any evidence of stroke. Given that you 
were found in this rhythm however, you will need to take a blood 
thinner that will prevent you from forming clots that could 
cause stroke in the future. 
Likely, your symptoms can be described as a TIA (transient 
ischemic attack) which is a mini-stroke. 
Your new medications are as follows: 
1. Eliquis (apixaban)
2. Atorvastatin 20mg daily
3. Metoprolol 50mg twice daily 
Please STOP taking Adderall as this can worsen your afib

You will follow up with Dr. ___ neurologist) in a few 
months and will be contacted shortly for a follow up 
appointment. 
 
Followup Instructions:
