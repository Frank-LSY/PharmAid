2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) ___ is a ___ y/o female with a past psychiatric history of 
PTSD, MDD, and recent discharge from an inpatient psychiatric 
unit (___), who self presented to the ED with complaints of 
worsening mood, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts, plan and 
intent. 
 
On admission ___ described worsening mood and anxiety for the 
few months in the setting of several recent stressors, her main 
one being the recent break with her best friend ___ who was 
also her therapist for the past ___ years. Her and ___ were very 
close and would take trips together, every time ___ was distress 
___ would be her point person. However on a camping trip with 
___ and ___ husband ___ was assaulted by ___ s husband, which 
caused her PTSD sx's to re-emerge and re experience trauma. She 
noted that after this incident she was hospitalized for 2 weeks 
at ___ were her therapist was filed on for 
concerns of boundary crossings. ___ feels guilty regarding these 
turn of events. She endorsed feelings of worthlessness, guilt, 
hopelessness, helplessness, as well as insomnia was only 
sleeping ___ hours a night, severe anxiety, hyper-vigilance, 
avoidance, flash backs, nightmares, and suicidal ideation with 
plan which she developed and elaborate during her last 
admission. She stated during her admission at ___ 
___ she was able to develop a to do list before she hung 
herself. She had already tied a rope in a tree in her back yard, 
which was the reason for her last inpatient hospitalization. The 
police never found this rope, but she continued to intend to use 
this method to end her life. The list was composed of things her 
family needed to take care of before she committed suicide. She 
admitted to lying to the inpatient team stating she was no 
longer suicidal, and went home with the intent to kill herself. 
She cleaned her room, and began to make her list, but could not 
go through with it because her parents were in her home at the 
time. 

While at work, she works as a ___ but must park in a 9 story 
parking garage, patient admitted to thinking of jumping off the 
ledge. She notes at this time while looking over the ledge she 
felt peace. She endorsed feeling her family would be better off 
with out her, and that she was a burden to everyone. On MSE 
patient had moderate psychomotor agitation as well as pronounced 
startle response, her affect was restricted and anxious, and she 
continued to endorse suicidal ideation. Clinically the 
differential is broad there is clearly evidence for a diagnosis 
of PTSD given her trauma history and symptoms, however there 
appears to be a separate mood component.  It is unclear if 
patient has a mayor depressive mood disorder or if she could 
have an underlying bipolar affective disorder mixed episode. 
Given her multiple failed trials with SSRIs including ( Celexa, 
Cymbalta, Effexor, Remeron, Paxil, Welbutrin) . She does clearly 
have a depressive mood disorder but the etiology remains 
unclear. 

Given concerns for activating effects of Cymbalta patients dose 
was decreased from 120 mg to 60 mg on ___ her Zyprexa was 
decreased from 10 mg BID to 15 mg QHS due to concerns of 
akathesia. On ___ patient was started on clonidine to 
target her PTSD symptoms.  On ___ patients trazodone was 
increased to 200 mg QHS to aid with insomnia , and her buspar 
was increased to 20 mg TID to aid with anxiety . Patient 
tolerated these medication changes well but continued to endorse 
minimal change in her presenting symptoms. 

On ___ a family meeting was held with father, mother, and 
brother present as well as primary inpatient team to discuss 
patients diagnosis, management, providing psychoeducation as 
well as discuss safety and disposition planning. During this 
meeting family noted concerns for patients worsening mood and 
inability to share her feelings with them in the past, leading 
to them not being able to provide adequate supports. Family was 
educated on possible differential diagnosis, and medication 
changes were discussed. At this meeting patient was agreeable to 
trial Lamictal for mood stabilization, therefore on ___ 
patient was started on 25 mg of lamictal daily.  Patient also 
agreed to referral to outpatient partial hospitalization 
program, as well as participation in psychological testing in 
order to clarify her diagnosis. During this meeting patient 
endorsed she no longer felt suicide was an option and was able 
to note how her disease had affected her family. 

At time of discharge she noted improvements in her sleep and 
somewhat in her anxiety, she also denied suicidal ideation as 
she felt this would negatively affect her family. She recognized 
during the family meeting that her relatives care about her. On 
MSE her psychomotor agitation had improved, and self reported 
mood was noted to be less anxious, she endorsed being motivated 
to continue to work on her mood though intensive outpatient 
therapy. Given patient signed a 3 day notice, which expired on 
___.
On ___, another family meeting was held with pt and her 
father. Ms. ___ continued to ask to be discharged. Inpatient 
team has hoped that pt agrees to stay until ___. This way, 
she could have smooth transition to the partial hospital program 
in addition to therapeutic milieu, opportunity to complete 
psychological testing and re assess effect from medication 
regimen.
However, Ms. ___ expressed concern that staying on the psychiatric 
floor has triggering her memories of traumatic experiences. 
E.g., she was upset to observe some disorganized behaviors of 
another male client.
Pt's father was involved in the conversation and discussion. 
Family recognizes the severity of issue. Pt and family agreed 
that pt will stay with her parents for the next week. Pt and 
father are planning to work together on renovating patient's 
house in ___. Pt and family were educated about risk of EtOH: 
rec'd that pt refrains from EtOH as it can increase depression, 
impulsivity and increase risk for suicide.

We discussed emergency steps that pt and her family could take: 
call ___ reach out to ___ Emergency Services Team 
___ contact pt's providers.
Option of filing for involuntary treatment (sect 7, 8, 8b) was 
considered and rejected. While pt is at high risk long term, 
there is no evidence for imminent risk. Also, that step will 
likely , retraumatize pt and negatively affect pt's motivation 
to treat her serious but long standing condition.

Pt reported that intensity of suicidal ideation actually 
decreased.
Given patient was no longer endorsing suicidal plan or intent; 
team felt she did not pose an imminent risk to self. Family was 
aware of clinical impression and was educated on importance of 
providing supervision after discharge. Patient was provided 
referral to a partial hospitalization program, outpatient 
psychiatry, therapy, and primary care for medical follow-up.

increased risk of harm to herself based upon endorsement of 
suicidal ideation with plan and intent.  Their static factors 
noted at that time include history of abuse, chronic mental 
illness, history of substance abuse, recent discharge from an 
inpatient psychiatric unit, Caucasian race, marital status, 
chronic pain.   The modifiable risk factors were also addressed 
at that time including suicidal ideation with intent/plan, 
hopelessness, social withdrawal, limited social supports, 
limited coping skills, insomnia, lack of purpose, active 
substance abuse/intoxication, polarized thinking, and recent 
personal loss. Finally, the patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors, help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, 
good coping skills, good problem-solving skills, lack of 
suicidal ideation, no history of substance use disorder, and 
strong social supports. Based on the totality of our assessment 
at this time, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is, guarded.
