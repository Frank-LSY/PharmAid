INSTRUCTIONS AFTER HAND SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for hand surgery. It is normal to 
feel tired or "washed out" after surgery, and this feeling 
should improve over the first few days to week. 
- Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow 
your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING:
- Non-weightbearing right upper extremity, light activities of 
daily living only (hair brushing, tooth brushing, etc)

MEDICATIONS:
  1)  Take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours around the clock. This is 
an over the counter medication.
  2)  Add  oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean 
off this medication in 1 week or sooner.  This is an example on 
how to wean down:
Take 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days, 
then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every before bedtime as needed x 1 day.  
Then continue with Tylenol for pain.
  3)  Do not stop the Tylenol until you are off of the narcotic 
medication.
  4)  Per state regulations, we are limited in the amount of 
narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must 
contact the office to set up an appointment because we cannot 
refill this type of pain medication over the phone. 
  5)  Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you 
should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and continue 
following the bowel regimen as stated on your medication 
prescription list. These meds (senna, colace, miralax) are over 
the counter and may be obtained at any pharmacy.
  6)  Do not drink alcohol, drive a motor vehicle, or operate 
machinery while taking narcotic pain relievers.

physicians at discharge.

instructed to stop by your surgeon.

- Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken 
out at your 2-week follow up appointment.
- Incision may be left open to air unless actively draining. If

follow up appointment unless otherwise instructed. Do NOT get 
splint wet.
