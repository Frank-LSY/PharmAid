Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with right breast cancer and nodal 
involvement admitted for observation after a right radical 
mastectomy and lymphovenous bypass. She had uneventful recovery 
in PACU and was transferred to the floor.  She had good pain 
control with IV pain meds and then PO pain meds. She was given 
IV fluids until tolerating PO. Patient was able to void 
spontaneously. Patient was concerned about drain care at home 
and was amenable to a visiting nurse but also nervous because 
her apartment is a 'mess'. She states she is not a 'hoarder' but 
she just doesn't like to clean up her place.  She felt good 
discussing it as a problem.  Patient met with social work to 
talk more about the situation and her resources.  Patient was 
discharged home on POD1 in a compression wrap around her torso 
and with 2 JP drains. Her pain was well controlled and she was 
anxious to get home.
