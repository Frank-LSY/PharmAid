Program for further assessment regarding possible refeeding

#Anorexia nervosa:
Presented with concern for refeeding syndrome. Of note, gained 
~12 pounds over the last 10 days. During this admission, vital 
signs remained stable (SBPs ranging 91-108/55-68, HR 56-70), 
labs remarkable for asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyponatremia 
(unlikely to be related to refeeding syndrome, likely represents 
volume status on presentation). EKG with sinus bradycardia (56 
BPM), without PR elongation or ischemic changes. Telemetry with 
HR 65 at rest to 90 with activity, without arrhythmias.

Placed on formal eating disorder protocol, compliant with lunch 
and dinner meals. Continues to have severe malnutrition, however 
overall low risk of refeeding syndrome given clinical stability. 
Ultimately, benefit of returning to residential therapy 
outweighs the risk of refeeding and will not benefit from 
further intensive monitoring in the hospital per summative 
interdisciplinary decision with medicine, psychiatry, nutrition 
teams.
