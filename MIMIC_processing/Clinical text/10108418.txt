IMAGING
=======
MRE (___): Mild CBD prominence, possibly related to 
cholecystectomy.  Otherwise, unremarkable MR enterography. 

UPPER EUS (___): 
Impression: The ampulla was normal.
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz 
frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the 
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body and tail 
[partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus.
Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the entire pancreas was 
homogenous, with a normal salt and pepper appearance. Few 
hyperechoic strands were noted - over all pancreas was within 
normal limits.
Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct measured 3 mm in maximum 
diameter in the head of the pancreas and 1.7 mm in maximum 
diameter in the body of the pancreas. The duct was normal in 
echotexture and contour. No intra-ductal stones were noted. No 
dilated side-branches were noted.
The bile duct was imaged at the level of the porta-hepatis, head 
of the pancreas and ampulla. The maximum diameter of the bile 
duct was 5 mm. The bile duct was normal in appearance. No 
intrinsic stones or sludge were noted. The bile duct and the 
pancreatic duct were imaged within the ampulla and appeared 
normal.
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum 

Recommendations: Over all pancreas was normal.
Follow-up with refering physicians as already scheduled.
Return patient to hospital ward. 

EGD (___):  Normal mucosa in the whole stomach (biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy)
 (PEG)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

undifferentiated chronic abdominal pain for endoscopic

#Chronic Abdominal Pain. Ms. ___ has been having chronic 
abdominal pain for several months which has resulted in nearly 
30lb weight loss. She reports that she is unable to consume 
meals by mouth aside from coffee and occasional bites of fruit. 
She has had an extensive work up as an outpatient with no clear 
etiology identified. NJ tube was placed on ___ and tube 
feeds initiated without incident. She reached her goal rate on 
___. She underwent endoscopic ultrasound and EGD which was 
unremarkable. MRE revealed mild prominence of the CBD (which is 
likely related to her cholecystectomy). GI was consulted, 
thought that her current presentation can be explained by 
narcotic bowel syndrome, with frequently recurring abdominal 
pain that worsens with continued or escalating doses of 
narcotics. They have advised slow weaning from her opiate 
regimen and replacement with alternative pain modalities. DDx 
for her abdominal pain include adrenal insufficiency (AM 
cortisol normal), porphyria (urine porphobilinogen negative), 
angioedema (C4 negative), and lead poisoning.

She has a follow up nutrition appointment scheduled for ___, 
___ with her dietician. Her pain was treated with her home 
pain regimen: PO hydromorphone 2mg q6 PRN, PO oxycodone 5mg q6h 
PRN, duloxetine 60 mg, and ondansetron 4mg q8 prn for nausea.

#GERD. She was continued on her home omeprazole.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[ ] Please follow up with your dietician to manage your tube 
feeds on discharge
[ ] Consider transitioning to TCA or SNRI and wean narcotics as
outpatient in the event that symptoms are related to narcotic 
bowel syndrome 
[ ] Consider outpatient heavy metal testing

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for placement of a feeding 
tube as well as tests to better understand the cause of your 
abdominal pain.  You had an NJ (___) tube placed by 
interventional radiology and have been started on tube feeds.  
To evaluate your abdominal pain you underwent a MRI of your 
small bowel which showed mild prominence of your common bile 
duct which can be seen if your gallbladder is taken out. There 
are no other abnormalities seen on your MRI. You also underwent 
an endoscopic ultrasound to evaluate your pancreas which did not 
show any abnormalities. The exact cause of your abdominal pain 
remains unclear.

On discharge, please follow up immediately with your registered 
dietician to help determine your nutritional needs. We will 
include a copy of your nutrition evaluation to help you and your 
dietician. You should also be sure to follow-up with your 
primary care doctor Dr. ___: ___ within the 
next week.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your ___ team
