IMAGING
====================
___ RUQ US
IMPRESSION:
1.  Cholelithiasis with a mildly thickened and edematous 
gallbladder wall, which can be seen in acute cholecystitis.
2.  1.1 cm echogenic lesion in the left hepatic lobe.  Given 
lack of risk factors, this is statistically likely a benign 
hemangioma.

___ EUS
Impression:
Sludge in the distal CBD.

___ ERCP
Impression:
The scout film was normal.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification. 
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left 
hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct were filled with 
contrast and well visualized. The course and caliber of the 
structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression 
and no ductal abnormalities.
A small filling defect consistent with sludge was seen in the 
distal CBD.
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed with the sphincterotome. 
There was no evidence of post-sphincterotomy bleeding.
Balloon sweeps were performed with removal of sludge. The CBD 
and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further sludge was seen.
An occlusion cholangiogram was performed which confirmed the 
absence of any filling defects.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations:
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 
cc/hr.
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated.
Recommend surgical evaluation for possible cholecystectomy.
No aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for 5 days.
Continue with antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 5 days.
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain, 
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP 
fellow on call ___

following instructions.

incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages
