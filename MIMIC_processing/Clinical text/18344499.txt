IMAGING
- CTA chest: The heart is normal in size. There is no coronary 
calcification or circumferential pericardial fluid collection. 
The thoracic aorta looks normal. There is no mediastinal or 
hilar nodal enlargement. There is a nonocclusive saddle embolism 
within the right main pulmonary artery. There are occlusive and 
nonocclusive emboli
within right upper, middle, and lower lobe pulmonary arteries. 
There
is also acute thrombus on the left involving lobar, segmental 
and
subsegmental arteries. Some of these are occlusive. The RV/LV 
ratio is
greater than 1. Despite this there is no reflux of contrast into 
the
IVC or hepatic veins. The visualized portions of the solid 
organs in
the upper abdomen look normal. Incidental note is made of a 
small
lipoma along the inferolateral aspect of left chest

The lungs are clear. There is minimal right pleural fluid. There 
is no
left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax on either side.

IMPRESSION:
1. There are large acute bilateral pulmonary emboli with 
elevation of
the RV/LV ratio to greater than 1.

2. There is a small right pleural fluid collection.

- TTE: The left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal 
left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size.
There is normal regional left ventricular systolic function. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection
fraction is 70%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow 
tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is no 
mitral valve stenosis. There is trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal with systolic prolapse. There is
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of HTN, 
HLD, recent arthroscopy who was admitted with a submassive PE

# Submassive Pulmonary Embolism: Patient transferred from OSH 
with submassive PE: large clot burden including saddle 
component. He was hemodynamically stable and on room air. 
Troponin was negative and BNP was normal. He received 4 doses of 
BID enoxaparin, starting at OSH and continued on the hospital 
floor. Case was discussed with ___ on call who recommended 
anticoagulation and TTE. Exam notable for pulmonary 
hypertension, but normal RV size and function. Ambulatory sats 
were notable for nadir of 86% on room air, which corrected with 
2L. He was sent home on ambulatory O2. He was transitioned to 
apixaban dosing. There was no evidence of bleeding. Home 
diuretics were held. 
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Patient started on apixaban, for at least ___ months after 
discharge. Anticoagualtion plan will need to be discussed at 
next PCP ___.
- Please follow-up with outpatient CXR to ensure resolution of 
small pleural effusion seen on CT imaging.
- Home diuretic and potassium were held to preserve preload, 
patient counceled to stay well hydrated. 
- Please assess need for ongoing ambulatory oxygen at next 
appointment
- Will need follow-up TTE to assess change in pHTN
- Consider hypercoagulability workup (Some labs from 
___ pending)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were short of 
breath. You were diagnosed with a blood clot in the lungs. 
Because the clot was large, you also underwent an ultrasound of 
your heart which demonstrated that there was elevated pressures 
in your heart, but that it was pumping well. We did not see any 
other blood work evidence of injury to your heart or lungs.

Because your oxygen levels were low when walking, you were 
prescribed oxygen to wear at home when your are walking or 
moving around. You do not need to wear the oxygen if you are 
stationary or sleeping. Please speak to your primary care doctor 
before stopping using oxygen. 

You were treated with 48 hours of injectable blood thinners 
before your were transitioned to an oral medicine called 
apixaban. You will need to take this medication for at least 3 
months. If you experience bleeding on this medication please 
seek medical attention or call your doctor. 

We recommend that you do not take you indapamide or potassium 
until you speak to your primary care doctor.

You should stay well hydrated for the next several weeks.

Please take all medications as prescribed and keep all scheduled 
doctor's appointments. Seek medical attention if you develop a 
worsening or recurrence of the same symptoms that originally 
brought you to the hospital, experience any of the warning signs 
listed below, or have any other symptoms that concern you.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
Your ___ Care Team
