Pertinent Results:
US of gallbladder:

Gallbladder wall thickening and edema is nonspecific, and may be

fluid, however cholecystitis is not excluded.  Consider HIDA

cholecystitis.  Follow-up ultrasound gallbladder on an 
outpatient basis is also recommended ___ weeks following 
resolution of the acute presentation if no intervention is 
planned. 
2. Mildly complex left renal cysts one of which demonstrates 
slightly 
thickened septations, and the other demonstrating multiple thin 
septations.  
6-month follow-up renal ultrasound is recommended. 
3. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease 
including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on the basis of this examination.

presentation if no intervention is planned.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with gallstones. You were

see your surgeon at your next visit.

weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You 
might feel somewhat depressed.
You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks.

incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

otherwise.

the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:

surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness".

mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not

prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
