History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ yo woman who presents transferred from an 
OSH
for evaluation of one day of LT sided body numbness with an
abnormal MRI and subacute gait disturbance since ___.  
Reports woke up at 5am and felt her LT index finger tingling. 
She
went on with her life and then around 7am she felt like her arm
was tingling, she washed her face and brushed her teeth. Her lip
felt swollen but when she looked in the mirror her face was
normal. About 9am she felt her entire LT side was numb "like 
when
you have novocaine at the dentist". She feels like it was only 
on
the left side and stopped at the midline of her body because she
could notice at her nose which felt rubbery on the LT but normal
on the RT. This episode has lasted about 5 hours but she still
feels some remanents of this now.

Reports since ___ she has difficulty walking over certain
distance, as she develops pain sore to touch in her calves.
Radiates up the back of her thighs, buttocks, lower back. This
lasts as long as she keeps walking. She rests and waits about 10
minutes for the pain to go away. She only notices it when she is
walking or standing for a long period in the shower. She has 
also
noted bilateral arm and neck pain when she makes her bed or
washes her hair. She was initially given prednisone 10mg, now on
40mg since early ___. She has also been taking gabapentin,
prescribed by her rheumatologist which was not effective so she
was weaned off. Her PCP and rheumatologist have performed CT
scans of her chest, and doppler of her legs which she reports
have been normal. She was also given hydromorphone by PCP but
nothing has worked and it has just made her feel tired.      
 
Of note last summer she was in ___ and found to have
pernicious anemia. Since then has seen her hematologist, had
several blood transfusions, and iron infusions. 

On neurologic review of systems, the patient notes numbing
pressure in her LT ear. She also notes urinary hesitancy 
recently
(3 weeks). Denies headache, lightheadedness, or confusion. 
Denies
difficulty with producing or comprehending speech. Denies loss 
of
vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing
difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies loss of sensation.
Denies bowel incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, rigors,
or noticeable weight loss. Denies chest pain, palpitations,
dyspnea, or cough. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. Denies dysuria or hematuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Left hemibody numbness and gait instability:
Patient was admitted to ___ for left hemibody numbness and 
subacute gait instability. Her neurologic exam on admission was  
notable for decreased sensation in all modalities on the left 
hemibody, extending from face down to legs. Initially, her 
sensory loss was minimal (80-95% of normal) however, ___ 
reported a "funny", "off" kind of sensation on the left 
hemibody.  By the time patient had presented to ___ from OSH, 
her sensory loss had essentially resolved over the past 24 
hours, remaining with just the persistent, "funny" sensation.  

Workup on outpatient basis was notable for MRI with T2 flair 
abnormalities in the pons, periventricular white matter and 
corpus. Repeat MRI head and cervical spine WITH contrast was 
attempted while an inpatient at ___, however this was not 
successful due to patient complaining of significant anxiety, 
even despite receiving Ativan prior to MRI.  Patient had a large 
volume lumbar puncture (40cc) done on day of discharge (___), 
for which a broad inflammatory and autoimmune workup was sent. 

Overall, the etiology for patient's symptoms was unclear. The 
most likely etiology was thought to be demyelinating disease 
(i.e. possible MS) given the imaging appearance of lesions, 
episodic timecourse of symptoms and age of the patient.  Less 
likely possibilities included subacute infarct given numerous 
vascular risk factors.  While patient did have significant 
pontine lesion on imaging, the clinical significance was 
uncertain given that her symptoms were minimal, with no cranial 
nerve deficits.  

By the time of discharge, patient was able to ambulate 
independently. She was also assessed 2 hours after her lumbar 
puncture. A number of CSF studies were pending at the time of 
discharge. Patient was arranged to follow up with 
Neuroimmunology specialist within her health insurance system 
upon discharge, as well as repeat MRI.  

#Diabetes Mellitus: Patient did have elevated blood glucose 
levels during admission, in the 100s to 200s by time of 
discharge. Due to unavailability of patient's ___ insulin 
in-house, she was placed on sliding scale. She also preferred to 
not consistently take her Prednisone (was prescribed by PCP as 
outpatient), therefore sugars were not more aggressively 
managed.  Patient reports that she does not wish to continue the 
Prednisone moving forward and will discuss this with primary 
care physician on the day following discharge. Therefore, no 
changes to insulin regimen were made, seeing that this depends 
on whether patient will continue home prednisone regimen.  
Patient educated at length about the importance of strict 
glucose control, and to check sugars before meals and bedtime.  
Patient educated about warning signs of hyperglycemia 
(polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, weight loss, headache) and 
when to contact physician.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Follow up MRI brain and cervical spine with and without 
contrast- appointment made at ___ MRI in large MTI scanner. 
- Follow up numerous CSF studies, pending at time of discharge:  
Herpes Simplex Virus PCR, Angiotensin 1 Converting Enzyme, 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Profile. 
-DOES NOT NEED REPEAT LUMBAR PUNCTURE. LARGE VOLUME LP DONE ON 
DAY OF DISCHARGE (___) WITH 40CC TAKEN. TO FOLLOW UP ON 
STUDIES, PLEASE CALL ___ LABORATORY AT ___. 
ADDITIONAL CSF HELD FOR WHICH ANY ADDITIONAL STUDIES CAN BE 
ADDED ON 
-Clarify prednisone regimen with PCP as discussed above. Patient 
is prescribed prednisone for unclear reasons (possible 
polymyalgia rheumatica) but patient reports it is not helping. 
Given importance of glycemic control, this should be established 
as it affects insulin regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital with numbness on the left side 
of your body and instability of your gait. To look into your 
symptoms, you already had an MRI of your brain, which did reveal 
some abnormal signal changes in certain parts of your brain. The 
cause for these signal changes are unclear at this time, and 
could be due to a number of reasons, including autoimmune and 
infectious causes.  We obtained a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) 
to check for a wide range of conditions.  We set you up for a 
repeat MRI of your brain and spinal cord with contrast to obtain 
additional pictures of your brain.  You will follow up with your 
prior Neurologist moving forward. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ care team
