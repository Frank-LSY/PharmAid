osteoporosis presenting with decreased po intake and worsening 
functional status found to have UTI.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Uncomplicated UTI
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
The patient has advanced dementia and is nonverbal at baseline. 
Presented with subacute to acute change in mental status, 
thought to be secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the 
setting of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Completed 3 
day course of ceftriaxone with slight improvement in mental 
status. However, remained nonresponsive and nonverbal likely in 
the setting of advanced dementia as below.

# Advanced Dementia 
# Nutrition
# Goals of care
Patient remained nonresponsive and nonverbal even after 
treatment for urinary tract infection without evidence of 
reversible cause. Likely baseline in the setting of advanced 
dementia. Complicated by difficulty to inability to take oral 
nutrition (pocketing of food with oral feeding), concerning for 
poor overall prognosis. Therefore, palliative care was consulted 
to assist with further management. Several goals of care 
discussions were held with the patient's husband and healthcare 
proxy with an ultimate decision to make patient DNR/DNI/do not 
hospitalize except for comfort and to discharge her home with 
hospice services.
