Service: NEUROLOGY
 
Allergies:

Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Dysarthria, facial droop, L arm
weakness/ataxia. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old R-handed woman with hx of atrial
fibrillation previously on Coumadin, recent fall with LLE
hematoma requiring transfusion, CKD stage 3, NHL s/p chemo, HTN
who presents with dysarthria, facial droop, L arm weakness now
improved, sometime before 6pm today. 

Pt is unable to give an exact time for her symptom onset.
However, she had eaten some dinner today when her family arrived
to visit her at 6pm. They reported that when they saw her, she
had left facial droop, her speech was slurred and when she took 
a
drink of tea, it "went down the wrong way" and she 
coughed+gagged
and vomited up some of her dinner. Her daughter reports that 
when
they saw her at 6pm her left arm was "flaccid" but that this
improved gradually since that time. She presented to ___ ___ where ___ was reported as 4 by one provider for
dysarthria, facial droop, and ataxia of LUE and weakness of LUE
and 2 via teleneurology for only dysarthria, facial droop. 

Earlier in the day she had a R frontal headache at 2:30pm that
improved with Tylenol and yesterday, ___ reported that pt had 
some
slurred speech that resolved before her family saw her at 
dinner.

At the time of interview, pt notes that her speech is not normal
and it is harder to move her left arm with accuracy. 

Reportedly 12 days ago per family, (but hospitalization was only
10d ago) she fell and developed large left hip/leg hematoma
requiring transfusion - she was admitted from ___ and INR
was 2.6 at that time. Coumadin was stopped due to bleeding and
planned to resume in 2 weeks. She did not have any fractures, 
but
hospital stay was complicated by ___ to Cr 1.9 -- decreased to
1.6 at time of dc and last Cr check 1.4 at her rehab facility;
Low BPs causing DC of home torsemide. She was DCed to rehab 
after
this and has been unable to ambulate but slowly working towards
this at rehab. 

On neuro ROS, she has been unable to walk since her fall. The pt
denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia,
dysphagia, vertigo. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel 
or
bladder incontinence or retention. No reported LOC or 
involuntary
movements. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills. Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or
tightness.  Denies nausea, vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was transferred to the stroke service on ___ from 
the ___, where she presented from her rehabilitation 
facility with dysarthria, left lower facial droop and left arm 
weakness. 

CTA was obtained at admission, which showed a cutoff in the R M2 
segment-superior division with distal reconstitution. An MRI was 
obtained on the morning of ___, which showed small punctate 
infarcts in the MCA distribution of the corona radiata, and she 
was monitored on telemetry. She was restarted on warfarin on 
___. 

Her home lisinopril was held for permissive HTN, and her beta 
blocker dose was halved. She remained hemodynamically stable 
with vital signs within normal limits throughout her admission. 
These were both returned to prior home doses on the day of 
discharge. 

Her neurologic exam improved throughout her admission, with 
significant improvements in both her dysarthria and facial 
droop. 

___ consults were obtained which recommended ___ 
rehabilitation, though Ms. ___ and family preferred that she 
return to SNF, as they were worried that three hours per day of 
therapy might be too much activity for her. SLP recommended 
ground diet with nectar thick liquids. 

Routine admission urinalysis was indicative of urinary tract 
infection and she was started on 7 day course of cefpodoxime.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of <> resulting from an 
ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a 
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
atrial fibrillation
high blood pressure

We are changing your medications as follows:  We restarted your 
warfarin. 
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Neurology Team
