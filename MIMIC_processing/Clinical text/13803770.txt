History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman, recently immigrated to the ___ 
from ___, history of ovarian and possibly intestinal 
malignancy, presenting with abdominal pain and chest pain.

Per patient, she was first diagnosed with cancer back in ___, 
during an appointment to assess for varicose veins. The doctors 
in ___ noticed an abdominal mass (unclear on exam vs. 
imaging) and recommended surgical resection. The patient 
underwent surgery with pathology resulting (per patient's 
report) as ovarian cancer. Pathology showed "tumor constituido 
por proliferacao de celulas com nucleos ovalados, redondos e 
fusiformes, alguns com entalhes separados por feixes finos e 
fibrosos, escassas fibguras demitose; tumor de celulas de 
granulosa, invadindo o tecido ___ (PT4NxM1). She did not 
report any use of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. She 
attributes this to seeing multiple doctors with multiple 
opinions and poor overall communication. She at this point went 
to ___ to seek a second opinion, again with no further 
treatment pursued.

She continued to be well until ___, when she start 
noticing LLQ pain. She went to a surgeon in ___, who felt 
that she had just a hernia. She underwent hernia surgery, during 
which she was found to have signs concerning for a tumor. The 
tumor was biopsied, with pathology showing "Tumor de celulas da 
granulosa do adulto, recidivante." She again did not receive any 
therapy as she was feeling well.

About 3 week prior to admission, the patient developed sharp, 
intermittent abdominal pain. She denies any other symptoms - 
tolerating PO intake, making regular bowel movements, and 
without any N/V. She endorses maybe 10 pound weight loss since 
her hernia surgery attributed to intentional dietary changes and 
denies any night sweats, fevers, or LAD. 2 days prior to 
admission, she actually came to the ___ for the birth of her 
niece's child. She again began developing abdominal pain, 
similar to prior, and presented to the ___ ED for further 
evaluation. 

In the ED, her initial vital signs were: 97.6 95 187/84 18 97% 
RA. Labs were notable for normal lactate, Cr, mild leukocytosis 
to 11.3, and unremarkable U/A. She did have CT Torso with IV 
contrast notable for large, heterogeneous soft tissue masses (up 
to 15cm in diameter) apparently arising from mesenteric tissue, 
as well as diffuse mesenteric lymphadenopathy. These lesions 
were felt to be consistent with possible lymphoma and amenable 
to percutaneous biopsy. She was given morphine for pain and 
subsequently transferred to medicine for further work-up and 
management.

On the floor, her vitals have been stable and she denies any 
current symptoms. She denies any chest pain, which was 
originally felt to be chief complaint, stating that the pain is 
actually in her epigastrium and b/l lower quandrants. She did 
endorse some anxiety, which may have triggered the initial 
concern. She denies any f/c/r, SOB, N/V, LAD, constipation, or 
increased ___ swelling. She does have varicose veins which hurt 
her at times.

She does express that she wishes to receive treatment and would 
be willing to remain in the ___ to do so if there is anything 
that can be do for her possible underlying cancer. However, she 
would like to go home to ___ if there is nothing to be 
done.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with history of malignancy, likely 
metastatic ovarian/granulosa cell tumor s/p 2 abdominal 
surgeries, presenting with abdominal pain of unclear etiology 
and abdominal masses concerning for recurrent ovarian tumor.

# Abdominal Masses: The patient presented with intermittent, 
cramping abdominal pain (as detailed below) and was found on 
imaging to have large abdominal masses with diffuse abdominal 
LAD. Given her prior history of malignancy, there was 
significant concern for recurrent ovarian/granulosa cell tumor, 
especially as the patient has only had surgical intervention 
without any prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There was 
some concern for more indolent hematologic process such as 
lymphoma, however, this was felt to be less likely given absence 
of fevers, night sweats, or significant (unintentional) weight 
loss. The patient did have TLS labs, which were unremarkable on 
admission. The patient presented with a large collection of 
prior labs and results in ___ from ___ and 
___, where she has received all of her medical care. These 
were translated with assistance from Interpreter services at 
___ as detailed in her oncologic history. Per the patient, she 
expressed the desire to stay in the ___ to receive treatment for 
her cancer if any were possible. As such, she was evaluated by 
both GYN Onc, who felt there to be no surgical options given 
location of her abdominal masses, as well as 
Hematology/Oncology, who felt that she should have repeat biopsy 
of her masses for further pathologic analysis prior to 
consideration of chemotherapy. As she was clinically doing well 
without any further pain, she was set up for CT-guided biopsy 
with ___ and Heme/Onc follow-up thereafter as an outpatient.

# Abdominal Pain: The patient presented with abdominal pain, 
which appeared to be subacute-to-chronic, intermittent, sharp, 
and crampy. Given finding of abdominal masses, this was felt 
most likely to be due to tumor burden and pain from diffuse 
lymphadenopathy. The patient denied any symptoms of obstruction, 
denying any nausea, vomiting, or severe constipation. Imaging 
was also unrevealing for obstructive signs and initial lab work 
was negative for liver involvement, pancreas involvement, or 
infection. She was provided APAP and tramadol throughout this 
admission and on discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet 
well and without any further complaints of pain.

# Chest Pain: There was initially concern that the patient had 
chest pain and she had an EKG, troponins, and CK-MB obtained, 
all not concerning for ACS. The patient was not tachypneic or 
hypoxemic and she actually felt her symptoms more to be due to 
anxiety. On exam, her pain appeared to be more epigastric in 
nature, as detailed above.

# Hypertension: The patient has a known diagnosis of 
hypertension and is on home "Co-Targen", a combination of 
Valsartan 80mg PO daily and HCTZ 12.5mg PO daily. She was only 
continued on HCTZ on admission given lack of formulary for this 
medication and initial inability of patient to remember home 
medications without assistance of prior records. Her blood 
pressure was within normal limits, however, during this 
admission and she was discharge home on her home regimen.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Patient has a history of T4NxM1 Granulosa Cell Tumor of the 
Ovary, s/p surgery in ___ without any chemotherapy or radiation 
therapy
-Patient subsequently had pain felt to be due to hernia in ___, 
but was found to have recurrent Granulosa Cell Tumor at that 
time in her intestines, again without any radiation or 
chemotherapy.

mass on ___ and follow up with Hematology/Oncology on 
___ to discuss potential chemotherapy options
