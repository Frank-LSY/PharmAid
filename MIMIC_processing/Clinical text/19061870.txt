IMAGING
======================
RUQ US (___)  
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or 
cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.  
2. Heterogeneous hepatic parenchyma limits evaluation for focal 
masses.  
3. Normal gallbladder and biliary tree.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of NAFLD, NIDDM, presents from ___ clinic with 
several days of emesis and diarrhea, found to have elevated 
lipase and transaminitis.

# Acute Pancreatitis
Patient presented from ___ clinic with 3 days of severe nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea. She had lipase of lipase 524 and AST/ALT 
101/66 on admission. RUQ u/s was wnl. Notably, she had 5 such 
episodes over the last 8 months. ___ and IgG4 were sent to 
evaluate for autimmune pancreatitis, and those were negative. 
Her symptoms improved with IVF and she was tolerating PO's by 
hospital day 2. AST/ALT downtrended to 74/54. An MRCP was 
ordered in-patient but was unable to be scheduled in a timely 
manner. She was discharged with recommendation for MRCP as 
outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- ___ and IgG4 pending at time of discharge
- Should have MRCP as outpatient to evaluate for mass or 
pancreatic duct anomaly
- Atorvastatin and Lisinopril can cause pancreatitis. If no 
other etiology found, then consider trial of discontinuation.
- Consider outpatient GI referral

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you. You came to the hospital with 
pancreatitis, which is inflammation in the pancreas. We did not 
find a clear cause for this. We performed blood tests and final 
results are not back yet. Please follow-up with your PCP to 
discuss the findings. You should have an MRCP (an MRI of the 
abdomen that is specific to the pancreas) performed as an 
outpatient. In the meantime, you may take anti-nausea medication 
called ondansetron. Please be sure to stay well hydrated.

We wish you the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ care team
