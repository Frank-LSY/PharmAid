Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on ___ under the acute care surgery 
service for management of symptomatic cholelithiasis versus 
early acute cholecystitis. RUQ ultrasound showed gallstones 
without GB thickening or pericholecystic fluid, however the 
patient had constant RUQ pain and a new leukocytosis. He was 
taken to the operating room and underwent a laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy. Please see operative report for details of this 
procedure. He tolerated the procedure well and was extubated 
upon completion. He was subsequently taken to the PACU for 
recovery.

He was transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically stable. 
His vital signs were routinely monitored and he remained 
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was initially given IV 
fluids postoperatively, which were discontinued when she was 
tolerating PO's. His diet was advanced post-operatively to 
clears and then regular, which he tolerated without abdominal 
pain, nausea, or vomiting. He was voiding adequate amounts of 
urine without difficulty. He was encouraged to mobilize out of 
bed and ambulate as tolerated, which he was able to do 
independently. His pain level was routinely assessed and well 
controlled at discharge with an oral regimen as needed.
