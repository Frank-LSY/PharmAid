IMAGING
=======
CTA HEAD AND NECK ___:  
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
2. No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm, dissection or 
vascular 
malformation, or significant luminal narrowing. 
3. Dental disease.  Dental consultation is recommended. 

MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___: 
1. Study is mildly degraded by motion. 
2. Two questionable punctate subacute infarctions in the 
bilateral frontal 
centrum semiovale versus artifact. 
3. No acute infarction of the posterior fossa. 
4. Few scattered nonspecific white matter lesions as described. 
Differential considerations include chronic microvascular 
ischemic changes, demyelination, history of migraines, sequela 
of prior trauma or infection and vasculitis. If clinical concern 
for active demyelinating process, consider contrast-enhanced 
brain MRI for further evaluation. 
5. Minimal paranasal sinus disease as described. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ a ___ yo woman with medical history of obesity, 
diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presenting with an 
episode of acute onset vertigo. She was admitted to the stroke 
service for further workup.

Hospital course by system: 

NEURO: Initial presentation concerning for central vs peripheral 
vertigo. Symptoms improved over the course of 24 hours and her 
neurologic exam was non focal on discharge. She was evaluated 
for an acute stroke with a NCHCT (unremarkable), a CTA showing 
small vertebral and basilar arteries likely in the setting of 
fetal circulation. She also had an MRI which showed a punctate 
finding in the LT centrum semiovale with no ADC correlate, 
therefore no acute stroke. However in the setting of her risk 
factors (HgbA1c 7.6%; LDL 212)these findings are concerning for 
possible TIA. We have modified her risk factors by adding ASA 
81mg PO daily as well as Atorvastatin 10mg PO daily.    

CV: She has known history of hypertension. Continued her home 
antihypertensives and monitored on telemetry without evidence of 
arrhythmias. 

ENDO: Known DM, continued home metformin and glipizide A1C 7.6% 
as above.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness and vomiting 
concerning for an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms. We have imaged your brain and blood 
vessels but found no evidence of acute stroke.
  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. We have determined to add aspirin 81mg, as well as 
atorvastatin 10mg to modify your risks. We will also obtain a 
cardiac echo and event monitor to follow up in neurology clinic.

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
