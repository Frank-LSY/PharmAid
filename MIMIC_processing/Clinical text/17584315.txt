elevation was noted in lead AVR.  These ST segment changes 
resolved quickly post-exercise and were absent 1 minute 
post-exercise. The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated APBs and  
VPBs. Resting systolic and diastolic hypertension with an 
exaggerated systolic blood pressure response to exercise.

with an 
exaggerated systolic blood pressure response to exercise.

**** Above plan reviewed and discussed with Dr. ___. All 
questions answered to Mr. ___ satisfaction as well his 
wife who was present during discharge instructions.  

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with complaints of headaches, 
shortness of breath, chest pain and numbness/tingling of 
hands/feet. You underwent multiple tests including head Cat Scan 
(CT SCAN), Echocardiogram (ultrasound of heart), stress test, 
cardiac catheterization and multiple blood tests. The above 
testing was normal and did not require any treatment.

Your blood pressure was noted to be elevated and we recommend 
medical treatment. Uncontrolled/untreated elevated blood 
pressure may be contributing to your symptoms and also places 
you at high risk of stroke.

We recommend you start the following medications:
1. Amlodipine 5mg daily in the morning
2. Metoprolol Succinate 25mg once daily in evening. 

Amlodipine is to lower your blood pressure. Metoprolol will also 
lower your blood pressure, as well as hopefully decrease the 
amount of "abnormal beats" and symptomatic palpitations that you 
have. (You were noted to have seven seconds of a fast heart rate 
called supraventricular tachycardia or SVT that was seen on the 
telemetry/cardiac monitor. You did not require treatment or 
intervention at the time. You reportedly felt "palpitations" at 
that time.) 

Restrictions and care of your right radial access site from your 
cardiac catheterization procedure have been provided.

We also recommend strict compliance with your sleep apnea 
treatment. Maximizing your sleep apnea treatment will decrease 
your cardiac risk factors. 

You will ___ with your PCP within one week. We recommend 
monitoring and charting your blood pressures at home once-twice 
daily at varying times of day for the next few weeks. Please 
bring your blood pressure log with you to your PCP ___. Your 
thyroid and cholesterol blood work was pending at time of 
discharge. Please review results with PCP at ___ 
appointment and address need for treatment if abnormal. 

If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your medical issues or are experiencing any 
symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need 
to return to the hospital, please call the ___ HeartLine at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner. It has been a pleasure to have participated in 
your care and we wish you the ___ with your health!
