Service: MEDICINE

codeine
 
Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Fall w/R-sided weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ man with medical history notable for reported Gullian ___ 
Syndrome who presented one day after syncopal episode with 
persistent pain after his fall admitted to medicine for further 
work up. 

Per ED and neurology notes, one day prior to admission patient 
collapsed while playing football, he felt as if his leg gave 
out, he states after the fall he could not walk and had to be 
carried in the house. Morning after the fall, he awoke with 
right sided numbness from the neck down. He notes that his left 
leg is increasing painful since the fall. He noted pan-sensitive 
review of systems including pain in the back of the neck, 
stomach, muscles in the back of the legs, hands. 

Per patient report, on ___ patient was playing football 
with his niece, went to through the football and that was the 
last thing he remembers until he woke up on the ground with his 
friends surrounding him. His friend told him that he hit his 
knee and head. After the incident he went home and slept well, 
next morning he noticed pain in his left knee, numbness and 
tingling in his right hand that progressed to include numbness 
and tingling on his right lower leg and face and he reported to 
the ___ ED. 

Patient reported to ___ on AM ___, had CT scan 
head and neck which were normal. MRI brain was reportedly 
normal, but couldn't tolerate MRI c-spine due to pain in the 
back of his neck. Labs at ___ was positive 
for opiates (not prescribed), negative for EtOH/APAP/ASA, Cr 1.3 
(1.0-1.1 in ___, hgb 15.8, INR 1.1, TSH1.2, CK 374, trop 
<0.02, BNP ___

CT Cervical Spine  ___
1. Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis; non-specific and 
can be due to muscle spasm 
2. No DJD 
3. Hypoenhancing lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid gland 
new compared compared from prior study.  

CT Head w/o Contrast 
No acute intracranial abnormality. No significant change since 
___. 

MRI Brain w/o Contrast
No infract, mass or hemorrhage; normal MRI of the Brain 

Of note, methadone is listed as a previous medication in his 
medication records. 

Similar episode happened to him in ___ when he lost 
consciousness, hit his chin on a counter and was brought to ___ 
treated with IVIG for GBS. Patient states it took weeks for the 
numbness/tingling to completely resolve 

Neurology was consulted in the ED, per their assessment, 
patient's physical exam does not have any focal deficits that 
can be localized to one area of the brain or spinal cord. The 
hemibody sensory loss involves the face, and therefore if brain 
imaging was already done today (as per report) then there is no 
need for c-spine imaging. In addition, given his history of GBS, 
and his report of a similar prodrome to the last GBS episode in 
___, it is worth keeping an eye on his respiratory status. 
Would recommend daily NIFs and VC's (or more regularly if 
worsening). If his neurological exam worsens then would consider 
an LP, though given the hemi-sensory loss, intact reflexes and
improving exam without intervention, suspicion for GBS at this 
time is low.

___ 06:22AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.7 Mg-1.___ year old male with past medical history of Guillain-BarrÃ© 
syndrome, remote opiate abuse, hepatitis C, recent incarceration 
admitted for fall/syncope and R-sided weakness, now with 
persistent RLE weakness/numbness without clear organic cause, 
suspicious for conversion disorder.

# RLE weakness/numbness:
Patient presented with fall and R-sided weakness (initially 
upper and lower extremity) to OSH and was transferred for 
further w/u. MRI brain at OSH was negative, as was MRI of the 
C-spine performed on admission. Plain films of the R hip without 
acute pathology, and HIV and RPR were negative as well. He was 
evaluated by neurology, who thought his presentation 
inconsistent with ___ syndrome given the unilateral 
nature of his symptoms. EMG of the RUE and RLE showed only 
mild-mod R median neuropathy at the wrist without additional 
evidence for cervical or lumbar radiculopathies or a generalized 
polyneuropathy. He had migratory weakness and paresthesias, 
isolated to the right side and most prominent in his RLE, 
without a clear organic explanation, and neurology was able to 
elicit a positive Hoover sign. In that setting, his symptoms 
were thought most likely attributable to a functional movement 
disorder (conversion disorder) vs malingering  (unclear 
secondary gain, but patient recently incarcerated with possible 
home stressors). Psychiatry was consulted and recommended 
aggressive physical therapy. He was seen by ___ daily and made 
slow progress during his stay. At the time of discharge, he 
reported no sensation below the R knee but was intermittently 
able to lift the R leg against gravity and wiggle toes on the R 
foot. He remained unable to ambulate, but was pivoting with 
assistance. In discussion with neurology, ___, and OT, he was 
discharged to rehab for ongoing physical therapy.

# Abdominal discomfort:
# Nausea:
# Hx HCV:
# Mild transaminitis:
Reported mild abdominal discomfort with intermittent morning 
nausea that improved over the course of the day. Abdominal exam 
reassuring and appetite intact without diarrhea/constipation.
Labs revealed a nl lipase and a very mild transaminitis in the 
setting of known, untreated HCV, without laboratory evidence of 
biliary obstruction. He was referred to hepatology for 
consideration of HCV therapy and has an appointment on ___.

# Syncope:
Occurred while playing football on a hot day - likely 
orthostatic vs vasovagal. CT PE was negative. Low suspicion for 
ACS (EKG non-ischemic, trop negative at CHA PTA) or arrhythmia 
(telemetry negative). No recurrence while hospitalized.

# ?CKD: 
Cr 1.4 on admission from 1.0 in ___. No change with fluids, and 
Cr stable at 1.3 on discharge. This may be his baseline in 
setting of above-average muscle mass. He should ___ with his PCP 
for repeat BMP as outpatient.

#Thyroid nodule: 
Incidentally seen hypoenhancing lesion in the right lobe of the 
thyroid gland with normal TSH 1.2 at ___ prior to admission. He 
should ___ with his PCP for ___ routine thyroid U/S.

#Acid Reflux
Continued home 20mg omeprazole daily.
