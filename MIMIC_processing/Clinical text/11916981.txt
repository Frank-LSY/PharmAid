___ URINE URINE CULTURE-FINAL EMERGENCY WARD 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to urology service from the emergency 
department for nephrolithiasis management with a known left 
ureteral calculus in setting of recent urinary tract infection . 
She was started on empiric antibiotics and prepped for operative 
decompression. She was taken to the OR urgently on hospital day 
2 and underwent left ureteral stent placement. She tolerated the 
procedure well and recovered in the PACU before transfer to the 
general surgical floor. See the dictated operative note for full 
details. Overnight, the patient was hydrated with intravenous 
fluids and received appropriate perioperative prophylactic 
antibiotics. She had significant pain that required multiple 
medications to manage. On POD1, the urethral catheter was 
removed and she voided.  At discharge on POD1, patientÂ’s pain 
was controlled with oral pain medications, tolerating regular 
diet, ambulating without assistance, and voiding without 
difficulty.  Ms. ___ was explicitly advised to follow up as 
directed as the indwelling ureteral stent must be removed and or 
exchanged. She has plans to visit ___ in the next weeks and 
is concerned about definitive stone management but will 
re-address this at follow-up.
