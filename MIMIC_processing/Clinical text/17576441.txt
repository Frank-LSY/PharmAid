Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with history of traumatic brain 
injury, history of disorganized behavior, admitted ___ 
with reported episode of confusion, with course notable for 
obtaining additional information from patient and PCP that chief 
complaint was actually her baseline symptomatology for which she 
is followed by her PCP and neurologist, assessed by psychiatry 
and felt to have safe discharge home with close PCP and 
outpatient psychiatry ___. 

# Mild Cognitive Impairment / Disorganized Behavior - patient 
initially presented with concerns of forgetfulness and visual 
changes; spoke with patient and PCP further on morning after 
admission---patient has reports of chronic "haziness of vision" 
and "forgetfullness".  She denied recent syncope, vertigo, 
dizziness, seizures, motor/sensory loss.  Given PCP concerns 
regarding patient's bizarre disorganized behavior, she was 
assessed by psych service.  They felt she might have had 
potential worsening of her visuospatial and executive function 
in the context of her known cognitive impairment.  However, they 
did not feel she had evidence of a mood, anxiety, or psychotic 
disorder, and did not have acute safety concerns. We reinforced
