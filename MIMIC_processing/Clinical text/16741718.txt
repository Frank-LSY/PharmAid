Service: NEUROLOGY
 
Allergies: 
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions
 
Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Confusion; falls
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ PMHx alcoholism (ongoing) with EtOH
cirrhosis, prior brain bleed (further details unclear, ___
c/b seizures (non-compliant with Keppra), and pancytopenia who
presents after recurrent falls at home and worsening
disorientation and confusion. History is obtained from HCP 
___
(daughter) over telephone and OSH records as pt is unable to
provide a reliable history.

Per daughter (HCP), pt fell two weeks ago (___) and went to the
___ ED. There, he had an unremarkable ___ (report
not available but transfer note from ___ states this) and 
was
discharged home. 

Now, over the past couple of days, pt has had increasing falls
and confusion. He has hit his head. Pt's girlfriend (no longer
available during my history) brought pt to the ED. Pt continues
to be a heavy daily alcohol drinker and reportedly drank ~12
beers on day of presentation. His girlfriend was also worried pt
may have had a seizure on day of presentation (further details
unavailable). Pt is non-compliant with all medications including
Keppra.

At the OSH, vitals were: 98.7 62 128/77 18 100% RA. Labs notable
for plt 52, WBC 1.9, serum EtOH 3, TBili 1.7 and DBili 1.0. 
NCHCT showed an acute left frontal lobe hematoma (3.8 cm x 3 cm 
x
4.5 cm) with local mass effect and subfalcine herniation (no
transtentorial herniation). Pt was given 100 IV thiamine and
multivitamin and then transferred to ___ for further
management.

Of note, daughter states pt was hospitalized at ___ in ___ for "a bleed in back on brain". She states it was from
"falling, drinking and low platelets". He was on the neurology
service (not neurosurgery, per daughter) and was in the hospital
for 6 weeks. His hospital course was complicated by seizures. At
the time of discharge and since discharge, he has remained
disoriented and confused and generally weak. 

Of note, records from ___ had a bleed in ___
however, daughter does not recall this bleed.

ROS unable to be reliably obtained. Pt does deny fevers, chills,
headaches or lateralized weakness or numbness.

IMAGING: 
NCHCT ___, OSH):
Acute left frontal lobe hematoma measuring 3.8 cm x 3 cm x 4.5
cm. Local mass effect, subfalcine herniation, and no
transtentorial herniation.

CTA head/neck ___: 1. Large mixed density left frontal 
intraparenchymal hematoma.  Surrounding
vasogenic edema is concerning for underlying mass.
2. No evidence of vascular malformation.
3. No evidence of stenosis in the intracranial or cervical 
vessels.

MRI brain ___: 1. Intrinsically T1 hyperintense lesion in the 
left frontal lobe, which has an
appearance typical of subacute hematoma.  No definite 
enhancement is seen
although evaluation is limited, followup is recommended to 
exclude an
underlying mass or a vascular malformation (as a nidus could be 
tamponaded by team mass-effect of the hematoma).
2. Blood products involving left posterior parietal sulci, 
differential includes superficial siderosis in the setting of 
prior bleed or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MRI SPECT ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Study is mildly degraded by motion. 
2. Grossly unchanged 70 x 41 x 58 mm left frontal largely fluid
structure with associated mass effect, 6 mm rightward midline
shift, and surrounding  vasogenic edema most likely represents a
subacute intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Structure demonstrates
minimal rim of enhancement, no definite underlying enhancing 
mass
or vascular malformation is seen.  Please note that underlying
mass or vascular malformation is not excluded on the basis of
this examination.   
3. Left frontal mass demonstrates decreased perfusion with
nondiagnostic MR 
spectroscopy. 
4. Grossly stable susceptibility artifact in the left middle
frontal and 
posterior parietal sulci, compatible with siderosis from prior
hemorrhage. 
5. No new hemorrhage or enhancing mass. 
The left frontal lesion given MR characteristics most likely 
represents intraparenchymal hematoma, though again, underlying
lesion cannot be fully excluded given the volume of hemorrhage,
and continued surveillance to resolution is recommended.  Repeat
MR spectroscopy with voxels placed in different areas will not 
be
of benefit as hemorrhage in all areas of the lesion will give
similar artifacting, and result in nondiagnostic spectra. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted with increasing falls and confusion. 
CT head showed an irregulular hyperdensity concerning for 
hemorrhage. He received 10 mg IV vit K, 2 u FFP and 2 u plt for 
immediate goal INR <1.5 and plt >50. Plt never reached 50, but 
given clinical stability and ongoing splenic sequestration, 
decision was made to transfuse for clinical bleeding rather than 
for specific INR or plt goal. His systolic BP was maintained 
<150.  MRI showed a very well circumscribed lesion which was 
overall consistent with hematoma, though there was only patchy 
areas of low signal on GRE, which raised suspicion for other 
alternate etiologies of the lesion. MR ___ was then 
performed, which was non diagnostic thus MR brain ___ contrast 
will be repeated in 2weeks. ___ recommend discharge to rehab. 

Hospital course by system:
# Neurology - ICH: L frontal 
- INDEFINATELY HELD ASA, NSAIDs, other anti-platelet agents 
- Cont home Keppra 1000mg BID for hx sz disorder
- Thiamine, folic acid, MTV for EtOH abuse
- Discussed with radiology, stated that hypointense area 
difficult to view due to overlying hemorrhage. At this time they 
suspect lesion is hemorrhagic but cannot rule out underlying 
tumor/mass. They do not think repeating MR ___ will be
beneficial as there is no way to get a better view. 
- NSGY consulted: Do not recommend OR this admission. Recommend 
repeat MR ___ contrast in 2weeks. Can reevalute need for OR at 
that time and follow up with outpt NSGY as needed. 

# CV: 
- Monitored by telemetry 
- Goal SBP < 150
- Propanolol 60mg PO BID

# ENDO: 
- Fingersticks QID goal >80 and <200, insulin sliding scale

# HEME: Pancytopenia
- Corrected coagulopathy and low plts PRN, patient's baseline 
platelet is around 30

# GI: Cirrhosis
- Patient is a high risk for OR as he is not a candidate for 
splenctomy. He is coagulopathic and will require intraoperative 
platelet
transfusion if taken to OR. 

# PPX: 
- Senna, Colace PRN
- Pneumoboots 
- Precautions: fall and aspiration

# CONSULTS 
- ___ 
- Speech
- NSGY
- Neuro onc 

# Code Status: Confirmed Full - by daughter  

# Health Care Proxy Contact Information: ___ ___
(daughter), **able to communicate health care information to GF
but GF not able to make medical decisions**

# Dispo: rehab, plan for ___

==========================================
Transitional Issues: 
- Please encourage patient to stop drinking 
- Increased BP medication Propanolol to 60mg BID 
- Patient was on CIWA which was discontinued on day 6 of 
hospital stay 
- Patient to have MRI brain with and without contrast as 
outpatient in 2weeks 
- INDEFINATELY HOLD ASA, NSAIDs, other anti-platelet agents as 
patient is coagulopathic and has brain bleed
