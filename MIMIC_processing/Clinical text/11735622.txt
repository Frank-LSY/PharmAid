History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ hx HTN, HLD, CAD s/p MI ___ s/p 3

 She states that while in ___ on vacation she had two 
episodes of acute-onset, severe chest pain on the right side of 
her chest, with radiation to the R axilla and R scapula, with 
radiation to the jaw and down her right arm. She presented to a 
hospital there, where EKG changes were found on ___ EKG. She had 
catheterization with DES placed to the LAD, and reports that 
disease was seen in RCA and diag as well, but were not 
intervened upon. She was discharged and then the next day felt 
unwell. She re-presented to the hospital and was transferred 
then to another OSH, where 2 more DES were placed to the RCA and 
diag. She then returned to her usual state of health until 1.5 
weeks ago, where she had completely different episodes of chest 
pain. She reports that she had several episodes of chest pain 
during moments of stress, reported as a stabbing-like feeling 
that was different than her previous pain. Pain was relieved 
with SL nitro. This morning she had L breast stabbing pain and 
so presented to ___.  
 At ___, EKG showed NSR, TWI in II, III, aVF, V3-V6, Q 
waves in III. Troponin was negative, CXR negative for acute 
process. Cardiology was consulted and believed the patient 
required recatheterization of recently-placed stents. 
Heparinization was deferred and pt was transferred to ___ ED.  

 In the ED initial vitals were: 97.7 64 127/80 14 93% RA  
 EKG: Sinus bradycardia @54 bpm, nonspecific IV conduction 
delay, Q waves in II, aVF, V1, TWI II, III, aVF, V3-V6. No 
previous tracing available for comparison.  
 Labs/studies notable for: normal CBC, chemistry panel  
 Trop-T <0.01  
 CRP 0.6  
 U/A with 3 WBCs, 3 epis, moderate leuks  
 Patient was given 1g APAP and 650 mg ASA.  
 Initial bedside echo by ED resident demonstrated ?small 
pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted and reviewed the 
EKG and performed another bedside echo which was less concerning 
for effusion. Cardiology recommended obtaining inflammatory 
markers to evaluate for pericarditis and to admit the patient to 
___ for formal TTE.  
 On the floor, patient denies any chest pain.

STUDIES:
===========
ECHO ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic 
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No 
significant valvular disease.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx HTN, HLD, CAD s/p MI ___ s/p x1 DES to RCA with 
recurrence of angina s/p ___ cath w/x2 DES to LAD, diag p/w 
L-sided chest discomfort with negative ischemic work-up c/w 
atypical chest pain. 

#Chest pain: patient reported xseveral episodes of chest pain 
during moments of stress, reported as a stabbing-like feeling 
that was different than her previous pain with her MI; it 
improved w/SLN. She then noticed L-sided chest wall TTP 
prompting her presentation to the hospital. Trops negative x2, 
CXR without acute process. ECG at ___ notable for NSR, TWI 
in II, III, aVF, V3-V6, Q waves in III. Due to concern for ? 
stenosis of recently placed stents, she was transferred to 
___. EKG in ED showed sinus bradycardia @54 bpm, nonspecific 
IV conduction delay, Q waves in II, aVF, V1, TWI II, III, aVF, 
V3-V6. Bedside echo was concerning for small effusion. She was 
monitored overnight without recurrence of pain. CRP: 0.6. TTE 
without WMA, effusion, normal EF. She was discharged with plan 
to f/u with her Cardiologist.
# CAD s/p recent MI, stent placement: records were obtained from

diag w/x1 DES
She was continued on her home regimen of clopidogrel, 
metoprolol, statin, ASA.
