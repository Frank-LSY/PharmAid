History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male without contributory history 
referred from outside hospital emergency department for left 
lower extremity DVT and bilateral pulmonary embolism. He was in 
his usual state of health until ___ when he presented to 
his primary provider for upper respiratory symptoms and 
productive cough, which was attributed to reactive airway 
disease in the context of mild persistent asthma, prompting 
addition of inhaled beclomethasone, which was not effective, so 
returned to his primary provider today with the
same. He noted left lower extremity swelling on the order of one 
week too. Left lower extremity ultrasound revealed extensive 
thrombus of the common femoral vein extending to the popliteal. 
A chest x-ray was obtained in the setting of his unrelenting 
cough, which revealed slightly prominent lung markings only, but 
no pulmonary edema or consolidation. He was instructed to 
present to ___ in the setting of slight tachycardia and 
oxygen saturation in the mid-nineties, where he was again 
borderline tachycardic, but hemodynamically stable with oxygen 
saturation in the low to mid-nineties. CTA chest was obtained, 
which revealed non-occlusive saddle pulmonary embolism of the 
right main pulmonary artery bifurcation with extension into the 
right and upper lobe segmental arteries. Thrombus within a 
medial segmental left upper lobe pulmonary artery was also 
noted. RV:LV ratio was greater than one, suggesting right heart 
strain. ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with PVCs only. Troponin 
was undetectable. He was anticoagulated with Lovenox 1 mg/kg at 
17:30, then transferred for presumed ICU-level care. He is 
hemodynamically stable with
normal oxygenation on arrival. Second troponin is undetectable. 
CBC, BMP, and coags all within normal limits. 
 
Past Medical History:
-Mild persistent asthma.
-Hypertension.
-Hyperlipidemia.
-Osteoarthritis post bilateral total hip arthroplasties in ___ 
and ___. Chronic left shoulder pain.
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
Paternal history of coronary artery disease. Otherwise denies 
familial history of malignancy or coagulopathy.

Studies:
========
CTA chest ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. There are acute bilateral pulmonary emboli with evidence of 
right heart strain. I discussed this with ___, PA in 
the ER at the time of this report.
2. Streaky bilateral upper lobe bands of opacity favoring 
atelectasis and/or scarring over pneumonia.

TTE ___:
IMPRESSION: Normal size right ventricle with evidence of 
pressure overload in the setting of atleast mild global 
hypokinesis and probable relative sparing of the right 
ventricular apical function (possible ___ sign). 
Borderline pulmonary pressure. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.

LLE Doppler ___: 
Impression:
1. There is extensive deep venous thrombus which extends from 
the left femoral vein through the popliteal vein into the left 
calf veins.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary:
==============
Mr. ___ ___ male with a PMH of mild persistent 
asthma, HTN, HLD who initially presented with left leg swelling 
and was referred from outside hospital emergency department for 
hemodynamically stable bilateral pulmonary emboli and left leg 
DVT. Was started on lovenox and transitioned to apixaban upon 
discharge. MASCOT consulted, no need for thrombolysis. Vital 
signs wnl during course of hospitalization and upon discharge. 

Transitional issues:
====================
[] First presentation of DVT/PE, unprovoked, no current risk 
factors. Likely will need life-long anticoagulation. 
Transitioned to Apixaban loading and then maintenance dosing. 
Follow-up on finances regarding Apixaban
[] Held blood pressure medications in the setting of 
normotension and PE. Please restart on outpatient basis when 
clinically indicated.
[] Consider hematologic workup of hypercoagulable states if 
clinically indicated
[] Will need further counseling regarding activities he should 
not participate in given that he is now on apixaban. 

Acute issues:
=============
#Submassive pulmonary emboli/deep venous thrombosis: Patient 
noticed his left lower extremity was swollen 1 week ago in the 
setting of 3 days of prior upper respiratory symptoms including 
cough, mucus, and shortness of breath. He scheduled an 
outpatient appointment for yesterday, at which time was worked 
up for a PE at outside hospital presented from outside facility 
hemodynamically stable with normal oxygenation and had lower 
extremity US demonstrating extensive thrombus of the common 
femoral vein extending to the popliteal. A CTA chest followed, 
which revealed a saddle embolus at the right main artery 
bifurcation as well as a left medial segmental embolism. CTA 
also demonstrated RV:LV ratio > 1, raising suspicion for right 
heart strain. However, cardiac enzymes were undetectable, BNP 
was normal, and ECG was likewise reassuring without signs of 
right heart strain. Patient transferred to ___ and 
continued to be hemodynamically stable with normal oxygenation. 
An echocardiogram demonstrated normal size right ventricle with 
evidence of pressure overload in the setting of at least mild 
global hypokinesis and probable relative sparing of the right 
ventricular apical function. Patient has been on Lovenox at 1 
mg/kg BID. Patient will be started on Apixaban 10mg BID loading 
dose for 7 days and then maintenance dose. He was discharged in 
stable condition 

Chronic issues:
=============== 
#Hypertension: BPs have been 120s systolic without hypertension 
medications. Would favor continuing to hold home 
hydrocholorthiazide and losartan until blood pressure trajectory 
is clear and seen by PCP on outpatient basis. 

#Asthma, mild persistent. Continue inhaled bronchodilators.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___!

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
- You were admitted for a pulmonary embolism from a clot in your 
leg that traveled to your lungs.

What was done for me while I was in the hospital?
- You had imaging including an echocardiogram to assess the 
function of your heart given the stress on your lungs.
- You were given a blood thinner while in the hospital (Lovenox) 
and will be continued on a blood thinner, Apixaban (Eliquis) 
that you can take while home.

What should I do when I leave the hospital?
-Please take Apixaban (Eliquis) 10mg twice daily, in the morning 
and at night for one week. After that, please take 5mg twice 
daily. While on this medication, please avoid risky activities

bleeding.
-Please begin taking your apixaban tonight at 8pm on ___. 
-Please hold your blood pressure medications until you see your
