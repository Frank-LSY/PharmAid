TTE ___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is normal left 
ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is

ventricular ejection fraction is 55-60%. There is no resting 
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic 
sinus is mildly dilated with

is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with
no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation.

is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes, regional/global 
systolic function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow 
identified. Normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

TEE ___
CONCLUSION:
There is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is normal. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal. There are simple atheroma in the 
aortic arch with no atheroma in the descending aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on 
the mitral valve. No abscess is seen. There is physiologic 
mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/vegetation are seen 
on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is seen. There is no 
tricuspid regurgitation.

IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast/thrombus in the ___. 
Normal left ventricular systolic function. Mild aortic arch 
atheroma.

CARDIAC CATH ___
Coronary Description

The coronary circulation is right dominant.

LM: The left main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the left anterior 
descending and left circumflex systems. There is a 20% stenosis 
in the mid and distal segments.

LAD: The left anterior descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a smaller caliber vessel. There is a 20% stenosis in the 
proximal segment. It runs toward but not around the apex. The 
septal perforator, arising from the mid segment, is a small 
caliber vessel.

Left Circumflex: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the 
left main is a large caliber and large distribution vessel. 
There is a 20% stenosis in the proximal segment. The OMBs extend 
toward the lateral wall of the myocardium without disease.

RCA: The right coronary artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is a 20% stenosis in the proximal 
segment. It is a hyperdominant vessel. The SinoAtrial, arising 
from the proximal segment, is a small caliber vessel. The Right 
Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal segment, is a 
large caliber vessel.

The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a large caliber vessel.

Aortogram: No evidence of an anomalous coronary artery

Findings
 No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
 New onset atypical atrial flutter
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with PMHx of HTN, HLD, and DM, arrived at 
___ Urgent Care with exertional chest pain and found 
to be in new atrial flutter. Patient was transferred to ___ 
for further evaluation. Patient underwent cardiac catherization 
with only mild stenosis of his cardiac arteries identified. He 
had a TEE to rule out thrombus and subsequently underwent DCCV. 
He had remained in sinus rhythm with stable vital signs since 
undergoing DCCV. A repeat TTE was performed without identifiable 
concerns. Patient was discharged in good condition.

onset of atrial flutter. Chest pain resolved spontaneously after

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were admitted because you were having exertional chest 
pain and was found to have an abnormal heart rhythm called 
"atrial flutter".

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You had a procedure called "cardiac catheterization" which 
showed mild narrowing in the blood vessels supplying your heart.
- We checked your heart for blood clot by placing a probe down 
your throat. No blood clot was identified.
- A procedure called "Direct Current Cardioversion" was 
performed to shock your abnormal heart rhythm back to normal 
sinus rhythm.
- We started you on medications to control your heart rate and 
prevent blood clots.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Please follow up with your primary care doctor.
- Please follow up with your cardiologist.
- While in the hospital, we stopped your aspirin, please do not 
take this medicine after leaving the hospital.
- Please take your other medicines as prescribed.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!
