Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  
Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed acute appendicitis. WBC 
was elevated at 11.3. The patient underwent laparoscopic 
appendectomy, which went well without complication (reader 
referred to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor.  
The patient was hemodynamically stable. 
  
When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain 
medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively 
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. 
The patient voided without problem. During this hospitalization, 
the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with 
respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively 
participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay. 

Psychiatry was consulted due to patient's request. The patient 
reported she was not coping well with her eating disorder and 
wanted to speak to psychiatry about it. Psychiatry made 
recommendations for a partial outpatient program, no inpatient 
admission warranted. The Social Worker was at the bedside, 
helping to arrange this for the patient. 
  
 At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
