History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year-old engaged, man, currently a pathology 
resident with
reported past psychiatric history of depression and anxiety, no 
prior psychiatric hospitalizations or suicide attempts, and no 
significant past medical history, recently seen at ___ ED for 
severe anxiety with subsequent referral to ___, who 
self-presented to ___ ED again due to increasing panic attacks 
and frequent thoughts of self-harm in the setting of numerous 
ongoing psychosocial stressors. 
. 
Patient was recently evaluated by psychiatry here in the ED on 
___ after patient presented with worsening anxiety and 
thoughts of suicide by overdose or swallowing a sharp object, 
but denied any clear intent or plan. At the time patient 
endorsed occasional panic attacks centered around work, 
particularly after stressful days. It was felt that at that time 
patient was of low risk for self-harm and would most likely 
benefit from partial hospitalization in addition to taking a 
leave of absence from work given then level in which it was 
contributing to his anxiety.
. 
In the interim, patient has been attending is partial 
hospitalization program at ___ regularly. He states that 
during the two weeks he went 5 days weekly but then after that 
___ scaled it back to 3 days weekly. He feels that initially, 
particularly when he was attending the program 5 days weekly, he 
began feeling better after attending the partial. However, since
it was scaled back a week or two ago, patient has been 
experiencing increased panic attacks, stating that he had 
approximately ___ last week. He describes his panic attacks as 
sensations of severe anxiety during which he is tearful, 
hyperventilating, has a sensation of chest and throat tightness,
and feels flushed. He also states that he experiences a 
sensation of derealization, almost to the point where he feels 
like he is "having an out of body experience." 
. 
In terms of triggers for his panic attacks, patient states he 
has been experiencing daily, frequent, distressing thoughts of 
self-harm. Patient specifically states that these thoughts of 
self harm are centered around cutting himself or hitting 
himself. These thoughts are so distressing to the patient that 
they often lead him to feel overwhelmed, which then results in a 
panic attack. Patient states these thoughts are particularly bad 
and overwhelming whenever he is by himself at home, leading him 
to feel afraid for his safety to be alone. Other triggers for 
his anxiety have been feeling of guilt and shame over being on 
medical leave from work in addition to anxiety over going back 
to work. Patient is employed as a ___ resident and 
has been on medical leave since he started attending his partial 
hospitalization program. He states that the first week or so 
after attending the partial, he learned coping strategies such 
as mediation and dunking his face in cold water that provided 
substantial relief for his panic attacks. However, he shares 
that the last ___ panic attacks have been unresponsive to his 
coping strategies and he has started taking more of his PRN 
clonazepam (prescribed 0.5 mg BID PRN, has been taking 1 mg 
during a panic attack). 
. 
Patient reports that he had a panic attack today while attending 
his partial program. Due to the severity and increased frequency 
of his attacks, along with intrusive thoughts of self-harm, his 
partial suggested he come to the ED for evaluation. Patient 
declined transfer to the ED and went home. After talking it over 
with his fiancé, ___, they felt it was best that he come to 
the ED for evaluation. Patient states "I've done everything I 
possibly can on my own" and feels that he would benefit from 
inpatient psychiatric admission. 
. 
COLLATERAL: Spoke with patient's fiancé, ___, who was present 
at bedside
for the interview per patient's request. She confirmed the 
patient's history and felt that patient would benefit from an 
inpatient psychiatric admission."
. 
On interview today, patient states that he has been having 
significant anxiety, almost daily panic attacks, and intrusive 
thoughts of self harm for the past 1 month. He has a history of 
anxiety and mild depression going back to ___ year of medical 
school, but he states that it has never been this bad before. 
Patient did his intern year as an OB/GYN resident in ___ 
last year, and found this incredibly difficult. He had severe 
anxiety related to worrying about work. He found himself 
constantly worrying that he would hurt someone. He also had a 
traumatic event during this year of residency in which a patient 
of his unexpectedly died and then they attempted a perimortem 
C-section, but the baby died as well. Patient switched to a 
pathology residency at ___ which he began in ___. He thought 
that the lack of direct patient care would alleviate his 
anxiety, but he states that over the past month his anxiety and 
panic
attacks have been worse than ever. He mostly worries about work, 
both when he is there and once he gets home. He still worries 
that he will unintentionally hurt someone or that he is 
incompetent at his job. He has significant feelings of guilt and 
shame for the difficulty he is having in residency. He states "I 
feel like a failure."
. 
Patient states that for the past month he has had low mood, 
decreased concentration, anhedonia, fatigue, decreased appetite 
with resultant 13 lb weight loss over past month. He has been 
sleeping normal hours, but has vivid dreams about work and 
reliving his traumatic experience in OB/GYN and wakes up feeling 
anxious and poorly rested. He has nightmares and flashbacks of 
this experience. He states that every time he hears a pager go 
off, he feels as if he is back in that case. Patient states that 
for the past month he has had vague intrusive thoughts about 
self-harm, including thinking about cutting himself or hitting 
himself. He has not engaged in self-harm. He has also had vague 
ideas of suicide, without plan or intent.
. 
Patient denies any episodes of mania or hypomania, including 
periods of distractibility, erratic/risky behavior, grandiosity, 
flight of ideas, increased activity, decreased need for sleep, 
or talkativeness/pressured speech. He denies hallucinations or 
delusions.

and anxiety, no prior psychiatric hospitalizations or suicide

at ___ ED for severe anxiety with subsequent referral to ___, 
who self-presented to ___ ED again due to increasing panic 
attacks and frequent thoughts of self-harm in the setting of

History and presentation notable for history of depressive and 
anxious symptoms with most recent episode in the setting of

attacks. Mental status examination notable for depressed mood,

Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is likely secondary to

avoidance, may meet criteria for PTSD as well. Nothing in his 
history to suggest prior manic episode and he is certainly not 
manic on my examination, nor is he psychotic. No history of 
substance use or any underlying medical conditions that would be 
likely to contribute to his current presentation.
