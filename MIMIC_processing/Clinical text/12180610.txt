 HPI: Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a past medical 
history significant for obesity, moderate obstructive sleep 
apnea, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation on 
Eliquis, prior MI when patient was ___ years old, and 
degenerative disc disease in the neck who presents as a code 
stroke as a transfer from an outside hospital.

The patient was last known well at 10:30 ___ on ___.  The patient was apparently in his usual state of health 
went was watching TV downstairs in the living room.  His wife

EMS who took him to the outside hospital.  Patient states that 
he slowly started to improve and feel better with no feelings of 
weakness.  He does have some difficulty expressing himself 
however.  Patient has never had any neurologic symptoms such as 
this in the past.  He is on Eliquis for atrial fibrillation, 
states that he typically does not miss any doses but may have 
forgotten to take a dose a day before yesterday as he fell 
asleep in the evening while watching TV.   Patient states that

Imaging:

MRI brain w/o contrast (prelim): stroke in right prefrontal 
cortex 

___ Portable AP chest:  
1. Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. 
2. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

___ CT Head, and CTA head and neck: from OSH read as negative. 


CTA head and neck done at outside hospital does not show any 
major vessel occlusions, however there is some mild intracranial 
atherosclerosis of the internal carotids.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___  is a ___ left handed gentleman with atrial 
fibrillation on ___ transferred from OSH for evaluation of 
nonfluent aphasia and mild left facial droop.  Initial ___ score 
was 1 for a nonfluent aphasia only.  Given that the patient is 
currently on an anticoagulant as well scoring low on NIHSS, 
patient was not a candidate for TPA at the outside hospital. The 
patient endorses some Eliquis noncompliance, particularly 
missing night doses. The most likely etiology for his symptoms 
is thus cardioembolic from his a-fib in setting of Apixaban 
noncompliance. R/o atherosclerotic narrowing given his obesity 
and hypercholesterolemia however NCHCT and CTA at OSH negative 
for significant stenosis.

Hospital course by system 
Neurology:
-MRI without contrast shows stroke in right prefrontal cortex 
-Continued Eliquis for atrial fibrillation. Discussed with 
patient and wife the importance of anticoagulation compliance.
-Continued simvastatin 40 mg daily at this time.
-Stroke labs obtained: 1dl 179, a1c 5.7, tsh 1.8
-Speech consulted who recommended d/c home with outpt speech 
therapy
  

Cardiology:
- Monitored on telemetry
- Continued home metoprolol 25mg BID
- Continue home diltiazem XR 240mg BID
- Captopril held to allow for BP autoregulation, SBP goal <180
- TTE showed mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, c/w CAD. No ASD/PFO seen. No LV thrombus.

Pulmonology:
-Pt on BIPAP at home 

ID: No suspicion for infectious process. 
- chest x-ray w/o consolidation.
- UA with moderate blood, possibly related to anticoagulation. 
Denies history of hematuria. Can follow up w/ PCP.

PPX:
-Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, on Eliquis.

Code: full code 

Dispo: Home with outpatient Speech therapy 

Transitional issues:
- Encourage importance of Apixaban compliance 
- Patient non complaint with Captopril dosing as well  
- PCP to monitor hematuria as outpatient 
- F/u Neurology and Cardiology and PCP as outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left facial droop 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
Atrial fibrillation 
Hyperlipidemia 
Hypertension 

We did not make any changes to your medication regimen. We 
suspect your stroke occurred in the setting of missed Apixaban 
dosed. We stress that you take your medication consistently and 
as prescribed in order to decrease your risk of future stroke. 

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
