Pertinent Results:
Stroke labs: A1c 5.8, LDL 172, TSH 1.6

CTA head/neck ___
1. Although there is suboptimal bolus due to IV site 
extravasation, there is non opacification at the level of the 
right MCA bifurcation and poor filling of the M1 segment likely 
represent thrombosis. 
2. Minimal filling of distal-most right MCA distribution 
branches is 
presumably from collateral in-flow. 
3. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass 
effect. 
4. The principal vessels of the neck are unremarkable. 

MRI Head w/wo ___
1. Large core infarction centered in the right insula in the 
right MCA distribution. 
2. Surrounding ischemic penumbra in the anterior right frontal 
and right parieto-occipital lobes, as described above. 
3. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation or new area of 
infarction. 
4. Minimal local mass effect, with no midline shift. 

ECHO ___
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. No left 
atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal 
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect or patent foramen 
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with 
maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 55-60%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  

CT Head w/o ___
1. Study is mildly degraded by motion. 
2. Evolving right MCA distribution infarct as described. 
3. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
4. Paranasal sinus disease as described. 

MRI/MRA Brain, MRA Neck ___ 
1. Please note study is degraded by motion, especially on MR 
angiography. 
2. Evolving right MCA distribution infarct as described. 
3. Suggested area of small right temporal microhemorrhage, which 
was not well evaluated on prior brain MRI due to motion 
degradation and not clearly visualized on most recent prior head 
CT. 
4. Redemonstration of right occlusion of right mid M1 with no 
definite flow noted within right M2 or distal vessels.  Question 
presence of thrombus within right M2 and M3 branch vessels. 
5. 1.5 mm left carotid siphon tiny aneurysm versus infundibulum. 

6.  Paranasal sinus disease as described. 
7. Limited imaging of bilateral carotid bifurcations and left 
vertebral artery origin secondary to motion degradation.  Within 
limits of study, no evidence of cervical MRA dissection or 
occlusion. 

TEE ___
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal 
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or 
saline contrast with maneuvers. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall 
contractility. There are three aortic valve leaflets. No masses 
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral 
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac source of embolism identified. No 
PFO/ASD by saline contrast with maneuvers. Normal biventricular 
systolic function.

___ dopplers ___
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity veins. 

MRV pelvis ___
1. No evidence of a thrombus in the infrarenal IVC or pelvic 
veins. 
2. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ man with daily drinking and 
cigar history who presents as a transfer from ___ s/p 
tPA (completed at ___ ___ for left sided weakness. On 
admission, his NIHSS was 5 for left facial droop, mild left 
sided weakness/sensory loss, dysarthria and extinction. His exam 
was initially stable and CTA, although poor quality because the 
IV infiltrated, showed no obvious evidence of thrombus. Later in 
the afternoon, the patient was found to have curling of his left 
fingers, clumsiness of his left fine finger movements, and 
increased dysarthria. His NIHSS was 6. MRI brain/MR perfusion 
obtained at 15:33 showed a core infarct in the right insula and 
part of the right frontal lobe including the operculum. There 
was evidence of penumbra in the right anterior frontal lobe and 
the posterior parietal lobe. Given that it was more than 10 
hours from last seen normal, NIHSS of only six, and lack of 
significant area of mismatch on MRI perfusion, it was decided 
that the risk of mechanical intervention outweighed the 
potential benefit of IA clot retrieval so IA therapy was 
deferred. Subsequent MRI demonstrated expansion of the infarct 
to include the penumbral region.

The etiology of his stroke remains unknown. He underwent TTE 
which had poor windows and subsequently TEE showed PFO. He 
underwent lower extremity ultrasound dopplers and MRV pelvis 
which showed no evidence of venous clot. Stroke risk factors 
were evaluated and A1c was 5.8, LDL 172, TSH 1.6. Started on 
aspirin 81mg and atorvastatin 40mg. He had labs ordered for 
hypercoaguable state and was fitted with holter monitor on 
discharge. ___ recommended ___ rehab.

Transitional issues:
[ ] Please follow up results of cardiac monitoring to assess for 
cardiac etiology of right MCA infarct.

[ ] Please follow up result of hypercoaguable workup and treat 
as needed.

[ ] Continue to encourage cigar smoking cessation.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left-sided weakness and 
sensory loss resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
High cholesterol  
Tobacco smoking
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
starting aspirin 81mg
starting atorvastatin 80mg
starting nicotine patch for smoking cessation

We also performed testing of your heart to see if you have any 
sources of stroke coming from a heart problem. You did have an 
abnormal connection between the two sides of your heart, which 
can increase the risk of a venous blood clot traveling to your 
brain and causing a stroke, so we performed imaging of your leg 
and pelvic veins, which did not show any clots. The connection, 
or PFO, is common in many people and may not be clinically 
significant.
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.  

 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
