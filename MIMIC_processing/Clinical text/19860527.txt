History of Present Illness:
___ yo female with history of substance abuse and multiple prior
presentations with episodes concerning for seizures, possibly in
the setting of substance abuse, who is transferred from ___ after presenting with report of 9 seizures over the 
last
___ hours. 

Patient is a poor historian. She remembers being fine in the
morning, and then she does not have any memory of having
seizures. She briefly recalls being at the ___. She reports that
she believes that she had 9 seizures over the last night. 

Per the ___ neurology consult note, patient had
numerous seizures overnight.  She also had 3 events in the
emergency department, two of which were characterized by 
rigidity
with some bilateral arm movement, lasting 30 seconds. There was
no apparent postictal period, no oral trauma, and no bowel or
bladder incontinence.  The last episode consisted of 30 seconds
of staring into space, which resolved.  It also appears that she
had withdrawal to light shining in her eyes during 1 of these
episodes.  She did receive 2 mg IV Ativan for these episodes.
Work-up included positive cocaine in urine.

Plan initially was to admit for EEG, but hospitalist declined, 
as
he felt that cvEEG would be more appropriate. Therefore, patient
was transferred to ___.

With regards to her seizure history, patient reports that she
began having seizures 3 months ago, with no clear trigger. She
describes her seizures as "generalized tonic clonic" and she 
says
that she loses consciousness and has generalized shaking of her
body. These usually last ___ minutes. She reports that she has
had one seizure every day for the last three months, despite AED
initiation. She has never hurt herself in falling during a
seizure. She has had only one episode of urinary incontinence
with a seizure and no episodes of tongue bite.  She also has
never had any seizures at work, and only seems to have seizures
at home.

Per the neurology consult note, patient has been admitted
recently in early ___ to ___, after presenting with
claims of being sexually assaulted.  In the ED, she had 3
reported generalized tonic-clonic seizures, each lasting about 
30
seconds.  At that time, her toxicology screen was positive for
buprenorphine, cocaine, and cannabinoids, and blood alcohol 
level
was 226.  During that hospitalization, patient had to be
intubated for agitation post-Ativan.  Workup included a head CT
(normal) and a 20-minute EEG which was normal, but did not
capture any events.  She was evaluated by neurology at that 
time,
and they increased her lamotrigine to 100 mg twice a day. 

It appears that the neurology consult team thought that it was
likely that at least some of the seizures could be in the 
setting
of substance use, and that some episodes were also likely to be
nonepileptic.  

Of note, it is somewhat unclear what AEDs patient is supposed to
be taking.  Patient reports that she is taking 30 mg 3 times
daily of phenobarbital, although she was not discharged on that
medication from ___ in ___.  The medication history
tab shows a prescription for phenobarbital 30 mg twice daily and
a prescription for phenobarbital 60 mg 3 times daily.  A level
was drawn at ___ and was reported to be therapeutic. 
Patient also reports that she continues to take lamotrigine 100
mg twice daily.  Medication tab also shows prescriptions for
topiramate and Keppra, although patient reports she is not 
taking
these.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ yo female with past history of bipolar disorder, 
trauma, history of IVDU with opiates, currently on suboxone and 
reports ___ years sobriety, ongoing cocaine use, and marijuana 
use, with 3 prior psychiatric hospitalizations and at least 2 
prior suicide attempts by self inflicted wrist injuries, as well 
as a history of hypothyroidism and recent episodes concerning 
for seizures, who was transferred from ___ to ___ 
___ after presenting with report of 9 seizures over preceding 
___ hours. 

Per the ___ neurology consult note, patient had 
numerous seizures overnight. She also had 3 events in the ___ 
___ emergency department, two of which were characterized 
by rigidity with some bilateral arm movement, lasting 30 
seconds. There was no apparent postictal period, no oral trauma, 
and no bowel or bladder incontinence. The last episode consisted 
of 30 seconds of staring into space, which resolved. It also 
appears that she had withdrawal to light shining in her eyes 
during 1 of these episodes. She did receive 2 mg IV Ativan for 
these episodes. Work-up included positive cocaine in urine.

On exam in ___ ED, her exam was consistent with functional 
neurologic symptoms, including splitting of sensation at the 
forehead midline and drift of the left arm without pronation. 
Additionally, patient's report of daily generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures with no injury, no tongue bite, only one episode of 
urinary incontinence, and no disruption to her work schedule, 
were thought to be concerning for psychogenic non-epileptic 
seizures, than a primary seizure disorder. Due to patient's 
family history of seizures, previous provoked seizures in 
setting of substance abuse/withdrawal and as epileptic seizures 
and PNES can co-exist therefore she was placed on EEG. 
Psychiatry team saw patient in ED and she was placed on ___ due to concern for previous report of suicidal ideation to 
her mother.
On the ___ floor, we captured one episode on EEG, this was 
characterized by generalized tremulous non-rhythmic shaking of 
all 4 extremities which waxed and waned throughout the episode, 
with eyes closed during a part of the episode and staring at 
other times, also some neck flexion movements with torso and 
pelvic thrusting movements. This self resolved after ___ 
minutes, pt alert and oriented afterwards and requested Ativan. 
After discussion that episode was non-epileptic, patient removed 
EEG and wanted to leave. At that time, psychiatry team also saw 
patient and patient agreed to stay overnight till Psychiatry was 
able to clear her the following morning on ___.

We discussed the diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures 
with patient, who understood the diagnosis and agreed to discuss 
weaning of her phenobarbital and other AEDs with her Primary 
Care Doctor on outpatient basis. She endorsed several recent 
stressors and agreed to follow with her therapist on ___. We 
also discussed the ___ and gave her 
resources for functional neurological disease and psychogenic 
non-epileptic seizures.

==================================================
Transitional issues:

- continue therapy, discuss CBT for Functional neurological 
disease and PNES
- weaning of Phenobarbital and Lamictal with PCP as episodes 
were likely not epileptic seizures

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were transferred from ___ to ___ after 
presenting with 9 episodes concerning for seizures over ___ 
hours. 

You were placed on EEG and we captured an episode, it was 
consistent with psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. This combined 
with the history is consistent with a functional neurological 
disorder with psychogenic seizures. These are not caused by 
abnormal electrical activity of brain but rather by how the 
brain and rest of the body communicates in setting of stress. We 
highly recommend that you continue to work closely with your 
therapist and psychiatrist for these. Cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) is highly recommended for this.

Please also discuss with you PCP about decreasing ___ 
medications as these do not help for psychogenic non0epileptic 
seizures.

We did not change your medications during this admission.

 
 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
