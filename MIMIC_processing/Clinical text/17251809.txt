Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old with no significant PMH who presents with a 
constellation of findings including fever, headache, cough, and 
diarrhea, found to have legionella PNA, hyponatremia and ___, 
found to be legionella + with hyponatremia and ___.
 
# LEGIONELLA
Patient reports several days of fever, associated left shift 
including 15% bands. Legionella urinary antigen presumptive 
positive. Also significant headache, SOB with cough, and more 
recent development of diarrhea. Other findings include hypoxia 
(92% RA in ED) and CXR with LLL consolidation, concerning for 
pneumonia.  Though patient does report a headache as first 
symptom, no neck stiffness, photophobia/phonophobia. Diarrhea, 
hyponatremia, and pneumonia likely from legionella.  LFTs are 
elevated and patient does have thrombocytopenia. However, 
suspect LFTs more likely related to alcohol use than cause of 
fever given pattern (though legionella can also cause LFT 
elevation). Pt was started on levofloxacin with improvement in 
symptoms. Will continue levofloxacin for ___: Urine lytes with FeNa <1% suggestive of prerenal causes. 
Also noted to have elevated prot/Cr ratio, suggestive of 
possible underlying renal disease. Ultimately, clinical picture 
most consistent with pre-renal, and Cr ultimately improved with 
IVFs. However, Cr was still elevated to 1.8 at discharge. Should 
be repeated at outpatient f/u appointment, and patient should be 
referred for renal evaluation if Cr remains elevated.

# TRANSAMINITIS: Likely related to EtOH use. LFT's initially up 
trended but then stabilized. RUQ U/S without concerning 
findings. LFTs should be repeated at outpatient f/u appointment, 
and the patient should be referred for hepatology evaluation if 
they remain elevated.

# HYPONATREMIA: Na 123 in ED, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, 
but could also be element of SIADH. Resolved.

# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Unknown baseline. ___ be related to acute 
illness, also possibly alcohol use. Resolved.

# HEADACHE: ___ be related to dehydration, hyponatremia, fever. 
Improved with treatment of Legionella as above.

# ALCOHOL USE DISORDER: Patient reports 5 drinks per night, last 
drink several days prior to presentation. Only mild withdrawal 
symptoms during admission (mild tremors). Pt encouraged to 
refrain from EtOH use. Discharged on thiamine and folate 
supplementation. 

# HEMATURIA: should have repeat u/a as outpatient to assess for 
resolution 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Pt to establish care with a new PCP.
- Should repeat Cr and LFTs at outpatient visit to ensure 
improvement.
- Needs repeat UA to ensure resolution of hematuria.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Legionella PNA
Hyponatremia
Acute renal failure 
Transaminitis
Hematuria
Mild alcohol withdrawal 

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evaluation of fever, headache, back pain 
and a cough with diarrhea. You were found to have a type of 
pneumonia called legionella that was treated with antibiotics. 
You were also found to have a low blood sodium and kidney injury 
that improved with fluids. You were also noted to have elevated 
liver enzymes, which is likely related to alcohol use.

It is very important that you establish care with a PCP ___ 
___ days to repeat your kidney and liver tests. You should also 
have a repeat urinalysis performed, as there was a small amount 
of blood in your urine here.

It is also very important that you continue to abstain from 
alcohol and tobacco use.
