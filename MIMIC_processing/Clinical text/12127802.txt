___ CTA CHEST:
Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified to the
subsegmental level.  There is a saddle pulmonary embolus with 
extensive clot burden seen throughout the right and left 
pulmonary arteries as well as the upper and lower lobar, 
segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries
bilaterally.  the main pulmonary artery is not dilated.  The 
right ventricle, however is mildly dilated which may be 
suggestive of right heart strain.  The thoracic aorta is normal 
in caliber without evidence of dissection or intramural 
hematoma.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within 
normal limits. No pericardial effusion is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Pulmonary Embolism: On presentation, the patient was mildly 
tachycardic to HR 110, BP 135/84, O2 98% on RA. ___, 
troponin and pro-BNP were normal. LENIs revealed a RLE DVT and 
subsequent CTA demonstrated extensive pulmonary emboli, 
including saddle embolus. TTE was not concerning. The patient 
was started on a heparin drip and admitted to Medicine floor 
given that he was hemodynamically stable. He has multiple risk 
factors including recent hip surgery in ___, as well as 
prolonged immobility and frequent travel (particularly prolonged 
immobility in car ride). Given that this is the patient's second 
clot, he likely has an underlying clotting disorder (or 
underlying propensity towards clotting), and will most likely 
need lifelong anticoagulation. The patient was maintained on a 
heparin drip for 48 hours with therapeutic PTTs, and he was kept 
on bed-rest for 24 hours given concern for embolism of the 
remaining RLE DVT to his lungs. The patient then ambulated while 
on the heparin drip without any symptoms; his oxygen saturation 
was 96% and he was not tachycardic. He was monitored on 
telemetry and did not have any abnormalities. He was 
transitioned to apixaban 10mg BID on ___. The treatment plan is 
as follows: apixaban 10mg BID x 7 days, then apixaban 5mg BID x 
6 months, then apixaban 2.5 BID indefinitely. The patient was 
given a script for a one month supply of apixaban, and the 
patient's partner was able to fill the prescription without any 
issues. We spoke with his general practitioner in ___ to 
ensure good transition of care; he agreed with continuing 
apixaban for lifelong anticoagulation and the need for follow-up 
care. The MASCOT team (for management of pulmonary embolisms) 
saw the patient on the day of discharge and agreed that the 
patient appears to be stable and safe for discharge, and agreed 
with plans for likely lifelong anticoagulation with apixaban. 
The patient was also given instructions to stay well-hydrated, 
wear the ___ stockings that were provided to him, take his 
apixaban consistently and on time, and make frequent stops to 
ambulate at least every 3 hours. He was instructed NOT to take 
his heparin SC injection that he brought with him from ___, 
and he was instructed NOT to take any blood-thinning medications 
like aspirin or NSAIDs. The patient and his partner verbalized 
understanding and agreement with this plan. At the time of 
discharge, the patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically 
stable on apixaban for at least 24 hours.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because you had a pulmonary embolism 
(a blood clot in your lungs). 

In the ED, our imaging showed that you had a large pulmonary 
embolism. We placed you on a heparin infusion for 48 hours and 
had you on bed-rest for 24 hours. We confirmed that your oxygen 
saturation levels and heart rate were stable while walking. We 
then transitioned you to an oral anticoagulant called apixaban 
while in the hospital. As this is the second time that you have 
had a blood clot, you should remain on apixaban indefinitely.

As you travel in the coming days, please stay hydrated, take 
your medication consistently and on time, wear your compression 
stockings, and make frequent stops along the way.

Please do NOT take aspirin, NSAIDs (e.g. naproxen, 
ibuprofen/Advil), heparin, or any other blood-thinning 
medications while you are on this new medication, apixaban. 
Please limit your alcohol intake to a maximum of 1 drink per 
day.

When you leave the hospital, please do the following: 
 - Please review all of your medications, listed below, for 
specific instructions. IMPORTANT: Do not take Cialis until your 
doctors ___ that its safe. 
 - Please continue to wear your ___ compression stockings
 - Please follow-up with your general practitioner in ___
 - ___ you are having any worsening chest pain, chest pressure, 
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, bleeding, blood in your 
stool, or black stool, please go to the emergency room as soon 
as possible.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
Your ___ Team
