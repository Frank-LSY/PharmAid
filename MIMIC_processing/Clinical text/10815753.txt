Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD#1 overnight, she was changed to Oxycodone every 3 hour 
dosing due to increased pain.
POD#2, her Oxycodone was changed back to every 4 hour dosing due 
to sedation.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Aspirin 325 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision 
was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with no range of motion 
restrictions.

not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These

ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, naproxen etc) until cleared by 
your physician.

8. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your Aspirin 325 mg twice 
daily for four (4) weeks to help prevent deep vein thrombosis

the 4 weeks, then you can go back to your normal dosing.
