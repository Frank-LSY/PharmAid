==================================
ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND ___
Impression: The major papilla was on the rim of a large 
duodenal diverticulum. 
Focused EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5 
MHz frequency
- The bile duct was imaged at the level of the porta-hepatis, 
head of the pancreas and ampulla. 
- The maximum diameter of the bile duct was 5 mm. 
- The bile duct was normal in appearance. 
- No intrinsic stones or sludge were noted. 
- The bile duct and the pancreatic duct were imaged within the 
ampulla and appeared normal. 
- The large duodenal diverticulum was noted endosonographically. 
 
- The gallbladder was completely normal with a normal wall 
thickeness and no stones or sludge noted.
 
Recommendations: Clear liquid diet when awake, then advance 
diet as tolerated.
Patient's labs may be reflective of a recently passed stone, 
however given normal appearing gallbladder would strongly 
consider other causes for elevated LFTs.
If any fever, worsening abdominal pain, or post procedure 
symptoms, please call the advanced endoscopy fellow on call 
___/ pager ___.
