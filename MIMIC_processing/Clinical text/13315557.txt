Pertinent Results:
___ -  CT/CTA HEAD:
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: 
There is redemonstration of a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage
in the right frontal region, grossly unchanged since the 
same-day
outside CT exam from 2 hours earlier. There is extensive
intraventricular hemorrhage bilaterally, right greater than 
left.
A right frontoparietal acute subdural hematoma 
measures approximately 8 mm. There is a right parafalcine
subdural hematoma measuring approximately 4 mm. Subarachnoid
hemorrhage is seen predominantly in the bilateral sylvian
fissures and at the level of the suprasellar cistern 
extending into the fourth ventricle. There is persistent 1.9 cm
leftward midline shift with subfalcine herniation. 
  
CTA HEAD: 
There is a 4 x 5 mm aneurysm seen along the proximal A2 segment
of the right anterior cerebral artery vs ACOM, somewhat 
difficult
to differentiate.  
(series 3: Image 272). 
  
The remaining vessels of the circle of ___ and their 
principal
intracranial branches appear normal without stenosis, occlusion,
or aneurysm formation. The dural venous sinuses are patent. 
  
CTA NECK: 
The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches
appear normal with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion. There 
is
no evidence of internal carotid stenosis by NASCET criteria.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the 
bilateral carotid bifurcations.
