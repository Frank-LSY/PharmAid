History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ PMHx mild dementia and HTN who presents
to ___ ___ with aphasia. History is provided from OMR, pt
(limited by aphasia) and family (daughter and husband).

Pt has mild dementia and at baseline is not oriented to time. 
She
is able to walk independently but needs some assistance with
ADLs. She speaks fluently and is able to read the newspaper and
watch TV.

On ___ (day prior to presentation), around 12p, daughter noted 
pt
to suddenly be "jibbering and jabbering" and "talking off the
wall". Pt could understand what people were saying to her just
could not get her words out. Her speech was also slurred.
Daughter noticed right facial drooping. Pt also dropped a cup 
and
husband thought that her right arm may be weak. The family then
went on errands for the day. When driving to the bank, pt seemed
confused and thought they were going to the doctor ___ her
daughter). Pt denied any weakness or numbness at this time.
Symptoms then resolved around 16:00. Pt ate dinner normally and
had no other issues the rest of the evening.

On ___, pt's family was telling her son about these symptoms and
son stated they should go to the ED. En route to the ED, around
11a, symptoms recurred (slurred speech with right facial droop
and difficulty getting her words out).

Pt was initially brought to ___. VS at arrival: 98.3 88
133/67 18 96% RA. Labs (CBC, chem 7) unremarkable. NCHCT
unremarkable. tPA was not administered due to unclear timeline 
of
symptoms and it was also not entirely clear if pt had returned 
to
her baseline between episodes. Pt was then transferred to ___
for further management.

At ___, VSS and normal. NIHSS 5 (age/month, L NLFF, aphasia,
dysarthria). Labs/UA unremarkable. CTA H/N showed patent 
vessels.
Pt presented within extended tPA window; however, again due to
unclear timeline and concern for not complete return to baseline
between episodes tPA was not administered.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache,
loss of vision, diplopia, dysphagia. Denies focal muscle
weakness, numbness, parasthesia. Denies loss of sensation. 
Denies
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty
with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, chest
pain, palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, or rash.

IMAGING
=======
CTA H&N - ___
1. Normal head and neck CTA.  Mild to moderate atherosclerotic 
disease. 
2. Superimposed acute hypodensity within the left basal ganglia 
and sub 
insular region on a background of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease, 
concerning for an acute infarction.  An MRI is recommended for 
further 
evaluation. 
  
MRI HEAD STROKE PROTOCOL - ___
1. Acute/subacute infarction involving the left periventricular 
frontal lobe white matter with extension to the basal ganglia 
and left sub insular region.  No definite evidence of underlying 
hemorrhage. 
2. Scattered punctate foci of susceptibility artifact throughout 
the brain 
bilaterally may be sequelae of mineralization or chronic micro 
hemorrhages, amyloid deposits is also a consideration. 
3. Chronic small ischemic vessel disease and global atrophy. 

ECHO - ___
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No definite 
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the Neurology floor. MRI brain 
revealed a L insular infarct. Highest concern was for 
cardioembolic etiology given location and size of infarct. She 
was monitored on telemetry, without evidence of arrhythmia 
throughout her hospital stay. Stroke risk factors, including 
HbA1c (5.1%) and LDL (101) were checked. Her home amlodipine was 
originally held for permissive hypertension, but this was later 
restarted with good control of her BP. She was started on ASA 81 
and atorvastatin 40 mg daily. 
She was evaluated by SLP and cleared for a regular diet with 
thin liquids, and who recommended outpatient language therapy. 
She was evaluated by ___ who recommended discharge to 
___ rehab. 

Transitional Issues: 
- As suspicion for tachyarrhythmia is high, Ms. ___ will be 
discharged with a 30-day cardiac event monitor. If this shows a 
paroxysmal tachyarrhythmia, her PCP ___ need to discuss 
risks/benefits of anticoagulation.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of speech difficulty and 
right side weakness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- high blood pressure
- high cholesterol  
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- starting aspirin 80mg daily
- starting atorvastatin 40mg daily
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician. 
 
 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
