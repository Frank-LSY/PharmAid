denies fever, chest pain, and edema. He reports that he 
exercises
regularly (treadmill and exercise bike) and does not have any
symptoms with this. 
 
He again went to urgent care on ___. Labs showed creatinine of
1.6 and D-dimer of 1170. BNP 738. CTA was negative for PE. CXR
showed pulmonary vascular congestion. He was transferred to the

IMAGING
==========================

TTE
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence
for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is >15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity 
size. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis. There is beat-to-beat variability in the left 
ventricular contractility due to the irregular rhythm.
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
45-50%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow
tract gradient. Moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with 
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch
diameter is normal. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is trace 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral leaflets are mildly
thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. The transmitral E-wave 
deceleration time is short (consistent with
restrictive left ventricular filling). There is mild to moderate 
[___] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] 
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
nomral cavity size and mild global systolic
dysfunction in the setting of beat to beat variability in 
systolic function due to arrhythmia. Restrictive left
ventricular filling pattern. Mild to moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.

RENAL U/S
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Unremarkable renal ultrasound.  No hydronephrosis. 
2. Mild prominence of the posterior inferior bladder wall for 
which ___ 
follow-up ultrasound is recommended to document expected 
stability. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
====================
PATIENT SUMMARY:
====================
___ with h/o HTN, HLD, GERD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on 
metoprolol who presented to ___ urgent care with 
shortness of breath and is transferred to ___ for concern for 
pulmonary edema. 

====================
ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
# HFpEF exacerbation:
# Pulmonary edema: 
# Dyspnea: Patient presented with 3 weeks of intermittent 
dyspnea, worse in last few days. Creatinine elevated, weight up 
___ lbs (baseline 185 lbs), BNP elevated to 738, and CXR with 
vascular congestion consistent with HFpEF exacerbation likely 
provoked by atrial fibrillation. TEE showed mildly reduce EF of 
45-50% with mild LVH and no RWMA. CTA negative for PE, and CXR 
without evidence of pneumonia. No history of obstructive lung 
disease. Trop negative. Maintained good O2 saturations on room 
air. Diuresed with IV lasix until euvolemic and discharged on PO 
Lasix 20 q2 days. 

# Atrial Fibrillation with HR 110s: Recently diagnosed as per 
atrius records, unclear precipitant. No e/o infection. CHADsVASC 
of 2. TSH, free T4 wnl. He underwent TEE/cardioversion to normal 
sinus rhythm on ___. His aspirin was stopped and he was 
started on apixiban 5 BID. His metoprolol succinate was 
increased to 150mg daily at discharge. 

# ___ on ?CKD: Cr 1.5 on admission (baseline 1.0-1.4). Cr rose 
with diuresis to 1.8 and then improved to 1.5 with held 
diuresis, thought to be secondary to over-diuresis. Renal 
ultrasound was unremarkable. Will need close monitoring of SCr 
___ on new diuretic regimen and to establish baseline 
Cr. 
Appears to have mild CKD possibly ___ longstanding HTN. 

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================
# HTN: Held amlodipine at discharge in order to uptitrate 
Metoprolol

# GERD: continued omeprazole 

# HLD: continued pravastatin

====================
