STUDIES:
TTE ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall 
is hypertrophied. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. No significant valvular disease 
detected.  

Cardiac cath ___:
Dominance: Right
* Left Main Coronary Artery
The LMCA is with eccentric ostial 40-50% stenosis without 
catheter dampening.
* Left Anterior Descending
The LAD is with proximal eccentric 70% at S1. There is a 70% 
mid-distal lesion in a small caliber vessel
after a large Diagonal branch.
* Circumflex
The Circumflex is with mild luminal irregularities.
* Right Coronary Artery
The RCA is with 95% proximal hazy lesion. There is a ___ 
eccentric distal stenosis.
The Right PDA is without significant disease.

Negative IVUS and FFR of the LMCA
Positive FFR of the LAD successfully treated with drug-eluting 
stent
Successful PCI of the RCA with drug-eluting stent
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
========
___ woman with history of smoking, chronic exogenous 
estrogen use, and rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone 
admitted for NSTEMI. She received a drug-eluting stent in the 
LAD and a drug-eluting stent into the RCA.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Lisinopril 2.5mg started on discharge. Please uptitrate as 
tolerated and check a chemistry one week to two weeks following 
discharge.
[ ] Held Cholestyramine due to interaction with Plavix. Consider 
restarting cholestyramine as indicated.

ACTIVE ISSUE:
=============

# NSTEMI
She presented with chest pain radiating into the posterior arms, 
shoulders, and jaw bilaterally. She had accompanying diaphoresis 
and lightheadedness. She had TWI in I and aVL on her EKG and 
troponin of 0.37 on presentation which peaked at 0.52 with CK-MB 
16 at that time. Echo did not show any focal wall motion 
abnormalities and preserved biventricular function. Given high 
suspicion for ACS, she was taken for catheterization which a 70% 
LAD proximal lesion and a 70% mid-distal lesion after a large 
diagonal branch. She had a positive FFR of the LAD and received 
a DES. Also notable for 95% proximal hazy lesion in the RCA and 
received a DES here as well. She was optimized on medical 
therapy with aspirin, high intensity atorvastatin, Plavix, and 
metoprolol. Lisinopril was added at the time of discharge.

CHRONIC / STABLE ISSUES
=================================
# RHEUMATOID / INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
Ongoing workup with outpatient rheumatologist. On long-acting 
prednisone at home (___) which is not on formulary. Increased 
regular prednisone to 15 mg daily to compensate. Her home ___ 
was held throughout the admission as was cholestyramine due to 
its interaction with Plavix.

# GERD: Changed home omeprazole to pantoprazole 40 mg PO 

# Hx SMOKING: ordered for nicotine patch. Smoking cessation was 
encouraged during her hospitalization.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You were admitted to the cardiology service from the ED.
- You had an ECHO cardiogram to look at the function of your 
heart.
- You had a cardiac catheterization to look at your heart 
vessels. You had 2 stents placed in the heart to open up 
blockages.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================   
- Please setup appointments with your primary care doctor as 
well as your cardiologist Dr. ___ at ___.
- It is very important to take your aspirin and clopidogrel 
(also known as Plavix) every day.

heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart 
attack.  
- If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing 
a blood clot forming in your heart stents and having another 
heart attack  
- Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to 
your heart doctor.  
- You are also on other new medications to help your heart, such 
as atorvastatin, metoprolol, a new medication which we are
