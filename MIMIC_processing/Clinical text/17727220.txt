ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
#Zolpidem Overdose 
#Medication induced Encephalopathy 
Mr. ___ presented with somnolence that improved, 
however, with
residual confusion and amnesia, particularly regarding recent 
events leading to his hospitalization. The differential included 
hypnotic effect from concurrent zolpidem and tizanidine use, 
transient global amnesia, or new deficits related to MS. ___ had 
a ___ leukocytosis that raised some concern 
for bacterial infection, although UA and CXR were negative and 
there was no localizing infectious source. Neurology was 
consulted for possible atypical MS presentation given unclear 
history and no MS medications as well as for amnestic episodes. 
However, did not feel this was an acute MS flare and with 
absence of focal neurological findings did not suggest further 
interventions. On HD2 ___ was oriented X3 but still with no 
recollection of events prior to coming to the hospital. 
Additionally, did not remember conversations with physicians 
that had occurred 1 hour prior. Psychiatry was consulted and 
thought ___ had enough capacity to be able to go home if ___ so 
wished. ___ was kept for observation and NCHCT showed no acute 
intracranial processes. It was believed that this episode was a 
medication induced delirium from which ___ was resolving with his 
newly prescribed delayed release zolpidem being the culprit. ___ 
exhibited improved memory later in the day and had recalled 
conversations from the morning. It was determined that the 
patient was able to to be discharged home. 

#Leukocytosis
___ had a WBC 13 on admission without localizing S/sx infection 
aside from recent history of diarrhea. ___ was at risk for 
aspiration in the setting of somnolence, although ___ never 
endorsed respiratory symptoms and CXR was without infiltrate. ___ 
remained afebrile and his leukocytosis resolved.

=============== 
#Muscle spasms
Held tizanidine upon admission as could have been contributory 
towards delirium

#Insomnia
Held amitryptiline, zolpidem 

#Hypertension
Held verapamil given ___ was normotensive and had not filled 
since ___

#Hyperlipidemia
Continued simvastatin

#GERD
Continued ranitidine, omeprazole
