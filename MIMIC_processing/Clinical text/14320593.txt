IMAGING:
=========
___ CT HEAD W/O CON:
1. Small focus of intracranial hyperdensity in the left temporal 
lobe 
measuring up to 10 mm may represent intraparenchymal or 
subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. Alternatively, the finding may represent a 
meningioma, given lack of priors for comparison. No surrounding 
edema or significant mass effect. No midline shift. Recommend 
short-term interval follow-up to assess for change. 
2. No acute fracture. 

___ CT C-SPINE W/O CON:
No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.

___ CTA CHEST AND CT ABDOMEN:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. 
2. No other acute process in the chest, abdomen or pelvis. 
3. Enlarged heterogeneous prostate gland. 
4. 11 mm enhancing focus in the right hepatic lobe may represent 
a hemangioma. 5. 4 mm pulmonary nodule does not require 
additional follow-up if patient is at low risk for primary lung 
neoplasm. If patient is at high risk for primary lung neoplasm, 
optional follow-up CT chest could be performed in 12 months. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S): 
For incidentally detected single solid pulmonary nodule smaller 
than 6 mm, no CT follow-up is recommended in a low-risk patient, 
and an optional CT in 12 months is recommended in a high-risk 
patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year-old male with a past medical history of 
dementia, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, who 
presented with syncope. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Syncope
Patient presented with two episodes of syncope, once in a seated 
position and once while supine, during his late wife's funeral. 
He denied any prodromal symptoms. Notably, he had a previous 
admission at ___ (records reviewed here) for syncope with a 
negative cardiac work-up including cardiac echo w/o structural 
heart disease and numerous EKGs. On initial presentation, 
patient had an ECG notable for changes that were stable from 
prior exams at ___, including 1st degree AV block. Troponins 
were negative x2. He was monitored on telemetry for 48 hours 
during his admission which showed no evidence of arrythmia. 
Orthostatics were initially positive, and patient was treated 
with 1 liter of IV fluids. Repeat orthostatics were negative. 
Patient ambulated and was mildly unsteady with walker; ___ was 
involved for evaluation of fall risk, and recommended home with 
services. Because of the history of his syncope and repeated 
episodes, cardiac arrhythmia needs to be further investigated. 
He was discharged with recommendation to see his primary care 
doctor for an implantable loop recorder for long-term arrhythmia 
monitoring. The medicine team attempted to contact his provider 
at ___ (where he usually receives care); however, due to the 
holiday weekend, no contact could be made. The patient and his 
family have plans to go to the ___ shortly after discharge. 
Our medical advice is for the patient to remain in the ___ 
until a diagnosis could be established; this was communicated to 
the patient and family. 

# Traumatic brain injury
# ? Intracerebral hemorrhage/Left temporal lobe lesion
Patient presented after syncope with headstrike. Initial CT head 
notable for 10mm left temporal lobe lesion, concerning for 
intracerebral hemorrhage versus meningioma. Neurosurgery was 
consulted in the emergency department and recommended starting 
Keppra 500mg PO BID for 7 days and holding subcutaneous heparin 
for 24 hours. Notably, patient had a recent head CT at ___ that 
showed a 7mm temporal lobe lesions; it was thought the 10mm 
lesion noted on imaging at ___ could be old. Neurosurgery 
recommended ___ outpatient f/u within 2 weeks of discharge 
with MRI brain w and w/o contrast, given potential concern for 
meningioma. 

# Dementia
Notes from ___ indicated that patient has had worsening of his 
functional status over the past few months in the setting of his 
late wife's illness. He has been requiring 24 hour supervision 
over the past few months due to recurrent falls and wandering. 
He is now dependent for all IADL's and most ADLs. In the 
hospital, he was A+OX2 throughout. On day of discharge, he was 
at his baseline mental status.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# Hypertension
Notably, patient was recently seen for a syncopal episode in 
___ at ___, and at this time, his home HCTZ was 
discontinued. He was continued on his home lisinopril during 
this admission.

# Type II diabetes mellitus
Patient's home metformin and glipizide were held and he was 
treated with sliding scale insulin while inpatient. 

# Benign prostatic hypertrophy
Continued home tamsulosin and finasteride. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] New medications: Keppra 500 mg BID PO for total 7 day course 
(last day: ___

[] Found to have 4 mm pulmonary nodule on CTA chest, does not 
require additional follow-up if patient is at low risk for 
primary lung neoplasm. If patient is at high risk for primary 
lung neoplasm, optional follow-up CT chest could be performed in 
12 months. 

[] Patient has primary care appointment on ___. Patient 
should have long term cardiac monitor to assess for arrhythmia. 

[] Schedule follow up with Dr ___ in ___ 
clinic in 2 weeks by calling ___ or ___. MRI 
with and without contrast can be obtained as an outpatient prior 
to outpatient appointment.
