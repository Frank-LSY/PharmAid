The scout film was normal.  
Cannulation of the biliary duct was attempted with a 44 Rx 
Sphincterotome but given difficulty was ultimately successfully 
performed with a ___ cannula using a free-hand technique.  
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification.  
The procedure was moderately difficult. During difficult 
biliary cannulation, the pancreatic duct was partially filled 
with contrast and visualized proximally. The course and caliber 
of the duct was normal with no evidence of filling defects, 
masses, chronic pancreatitis or other abnormalities.  
The CBD was 8 mm in diameter.  
One filling defect consistent with a stone was identified in 
the distal CBD.  
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were normal.  
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome.  
There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding.  
The biliary tree was swept with a 9-12 mm balloon starting at 
the bifurcation.  
One stone was successfully removed.  
The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones 
were seen.  
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD.  
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically.  
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with Hx of HTN and HLD presenting with RLQ pain 
and found to have cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis on CT 
ab/pelvis. She presented ___ for ERCP, which was done with 
sphincterotomy and removal of large CBD stone. Pt was admitted 
post-procedure for monitoring. She had mild pain on admission 
which improved with conservative measures and by HD2 was pain 
free. LFTs were mildly elevated (ALT 284 AST 363 TB 3.3), felt 
to be expected post-procedure labs. Lipase was normal. ERCP team 
rec repeating labs in 2 days and f/u with general surgery for 
cholecystitis to prevent recurrent choledocholithiasis.

Transitional Issues:
- Follow labs: LFTs and lipase on ___
- ERCP team recommended f/u w/ general surgery (Dr. ___ for 
elective cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent 
choledocholithiasis. 
- Avoid Aspirin, Plavix, NSAID, or Coumadin for 5 days post 
procedure
