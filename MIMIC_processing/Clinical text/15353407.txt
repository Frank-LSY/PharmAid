On ___, Mr. ___ was admitted for elective C6-C7 anterior

uncomplicated and he was transferred to PACU with JP drain in 
place. Please refer to OMR note for full operative course.
On ___, he was doing well, tolerating a full diet and 
ambulating. Upon pulling the JP drain, the distal end was noted 
to be uneven and there was suspicion for a retained fragment of 
the drain. However, there was little resistance when pulling the 
drain, and follow-up x-rays did not show any foreign bodies in 
the pretracheal soft tissues. The SKU number of the drain used 
was obtained from the operating room (___-___) and it was 
confirmed to be a ___ flat wound drain composed of 
silicone with barium impregnated for x-ray detection of drain. 
Given the lack of evidence for a retained fragment on x-ray, the 
patient was instructed on signs of wound infection and 
discharged home to follow up with Dr. ___ in 4 weeks.
