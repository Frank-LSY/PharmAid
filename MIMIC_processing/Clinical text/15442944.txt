Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with questionable past 
medical history of ___'s thyroiditis presenting with 
paroxysmal hypertension associated with lightheadedness, blurry 
vision, palpitations, concerning for possible pheo, and hip and 
arm pain which appears musculoskeletal in nature.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Paroxsymal Hypertension:
Patient is presenting with brief episodes of hypertension (as 
high as systolics 220s) associated with lightheadedness, blurry 
vision, and sometimes palpitations, chest pain, shortness of 
breath, and anxiety. Episodes increasing in frequency. Only one 
documented episode of BP >200 systolic (220/110 in clinic on day 
of admission). Referred in from PCP for workup of 
pheochromocytoma. Differential include labile hypertension, 
pseudopheochromocytoma, or anxiety/panic disorder. Episodes may 
also represent atypical migraines given associated photophobia. 
Unclear if patient's hormone therapy is possibly related to her 
symptoms. Recommended to patient to discontinue hormone therapy. 
Patient's 24 hour urine was collected for catecholamine and 
metanephrine testing. BPs remained stable since admission with 
no further. Will likely need further work up as outpatient. 
Consider empiric migraine therapy with abortive treatment vs 
neurology consult as an outpatient. Also recommend 24-hr 
ambulatory BP monitoring. 

# Pelvic Girdle and Upper Extremity Pain:
Patient has had pelvic girdle and shoulder pain for 2 months. 
She has been evaluated by rheumatology as an outpatient without 
clear etiology. Initial concerns for PMR but labs did not 
support the diagnosis. CRP, CK wnl at presentation. ESR pending. 
Patient received acetaminophen PRN for pain control. Will need 
to continue to follow up with rheum as an outpatient. 

# Bacteriuria: 
Patient was started on Macrobid due to positive urine culture 
from ED ___ which grew Enterococcus species. However the UA was 
negative from the ___ so Urine culture was inappropriately 
sent. Patient has no symptoms of a UTI, so likely
has asymptomatic bacteriuria, and has already completed almost 
of a full 7 day course (was rx for 10 days). Macrobid was 
discontinued. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# ___ Thyroiditis: 
Unclear diagnosis based on history. Per prior labs, patient has 
elevated anti-Tg Abs but normal TSH. She was previously treated 
with thyroid hormone replacement but has not taken any since 
___. TSH at 2.2 at presentation. No need for therapy at this 
time. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[]Follow up on 24hour Urine catecholamines/metanephrine
[]Consider initiation of SSRI for anxiety management
[]Discharged with short prescription for lorazepam 0.5mg BID:PRN 
for symptom relief if related to panic disorder. 
[]Recommended to patient consider discontinuing hormone therapy 
as may be contributing to hypertension and symptoms. Continue 
discussion with PCP. 
[]Consider migraine therapy with abortive meds and/or neurology 
consult as an outpatient given hx headache and photophobia
[]Recommend ambulatory 24hr BP monitoring for further evaluation 
of these episodes of hypertension
[]Follow up with PCP and rheumatology
