History of Present Illness:
___ with localized unresectable neuroendocrine tumor encasing 
the mesentery who developed nausea yesterday evening and was 
transferred with a diagnosis of SBO from OSH.  The patient has 
had upset stomach off and on with gas sounds for the past few 
weeks, but there was a change with nausea developing yesterday.  


This morning he couldn't eat cereal because of nausea and 
vomiting which was not controlled by Compazine and Zofran.  He 
felt weak and also couldn't tolerate oral nutritional 
supplement, so wife called ambulance who took him to a local 
hospital.  There he had CT scan that showed SBO with dilated 
proximal small bowel loops with air-fluid levels and a 
transition at the level of the
ileum.  NGT was placed but how much was suctioned up was not 
documented.  

He was transferred to ___ for surgical eval.  Here surgery saw 
patient and he had KUB that confirmed NGT location and signs of 
SBO.  Vitals 98.6 80 119/65.  Surgery recommended ___ 
medical management.

level of the ileum

KUB ___
Small-bowel obstruction, likely distal

Upper endoscopy
Normal mucosa in esophagus, stomach and duodenum

MRE
IMPRESSION: 
1. Evidence of unchanged distal small-bowel obstruction 
secondary to the 
central mesenteric mass as described above. 
2. Unchanged edema and mucosal hypoenhancement of the most 
distal dilated 
small bowel loops proximal to the transition point concerning 
for vascular 
compromise.  Evidence of marked luminal narrowing of the SMV and 
SMA. 
3. Moderate amount pleural effusions and large amount of 
intra-abdominal 
ascites. 
4. Unchanged central mesenteric mass biopsy-proven 
neuroendocrine tumor with associated mesenteric adenopathy. 
5. 8 mm hypoenhancing right hepatic lobe lesion, incompletely 
evaluated and remains indeterminate.  This can be followed on 
subsequent imaging. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Small bowel obstruction
#Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
The patient initially presented with nausea and was found to 
have a small bowel obstruction secondary to his known pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor. He was initially treated with an NG tube, 
kept NPO, treated with fluids and Zofran for nausea. However, by 
the second day of his admission, his symptoms were markedly 
improved, his NGT was removed and his diet was advanced. 
Endoscopy showed normal mucosa in esophagus, stomach and 
duodenum. MRE showed evidence of unchanged distal small-bowel 
obstruction secondary to the central mesenteric mass. Based on 
these findings, the patient's clinical improvement, and his 
ongoing ascites, surgery decided to hold off on a bypass at this 
time and see him in follow up as an outpatient.

# Ascites
Per hepatology evaluation, ascites seems to be multifactorial 
due to portal hypertension due to the obliteration of his portal 
vein and encasement of his SMA/SMV by his tumor, as well as 
obstruction of his lymph system contributing to chylous nature 
of the ascites. The liver is unlikely cirrhotic given normal 
LFTs,
synthetic function and non-cirrhotic appearance on OSH CT scan. 
For the concern for chylous ascites (based on patient's 
description) as well as overall malnutrition, he was seen by 
nutrition, who recommended a low fat, sodium restricted diet 
with ensure enlive supplements mixed with beneprotein and 15 mL 
medium chain triglycerides oil. A triene/tetraene ratio was also 
checked with results pending on discharge; if> 0.4 and s/sx of 
deficiency consider parenteral fat emulsion. He had a 
paracentesis on the day of discharge, both therapeutic on 
schedule for his weekly tap and also diagnostic to evaluate for 
chylous ascites. Also continued home Lasix 10 mg daily while 
inpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital with nausea/vomiting and found 
to have a small bowel obstruction due to your pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor. In addition to your primary medicine team, 
the surgery, hepatology and gastroenterology teams also 
evaluated you.

For the small bowel obstruction, your symptoms improved, and 
surgery decided based on the imaging and your symptoms that it 
is reasonable to wait to do a bypass. Please go to the follow up 
appointment with them.

For your ascites, the hepatology team evaluated and felt that it 
was unlikely due to underlying cirrhosis and more likely due to 
portal hypertension as well as lymph node system obstruction. We 
did a paracentesis and will notify you of the results.

In addition to your surgery follow up appointment, we also 
scheduled a follow up appointment with your oncologist and 
primary care doctor.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Sincerely,

Your ___ team
