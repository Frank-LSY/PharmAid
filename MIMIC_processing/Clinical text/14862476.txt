Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old Male with severe Left carotid 
stenosis, 80-99%, asymtpomatic, who was admitted to the ___ 
___ on ___. The patient 
was taken to the operating room and underwent a Left carotid 
endarterectomy. Following the procedure, hemostasis was assured 
and the wound was closed in layers. A dry sterile dressing was 
applied. The patient was awakened and extubated and found to
be neurologically intact. For further details of the procedure, 
please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient tolerated 
the procedure well without complications and was brought to the 
post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. He was placed NPO 
on sips and IV fluids and we waited 6 hours to re-assess 
swallowing. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to 
the vascular surgery floor where he remained through the rest of 
the hospitalization. After 6 hours from surgery, swallowing was 
assessed and adequate and the patient was advanced to a regular 
diet, which he tolerated well without difficulties. Given his 
history of CAD s/p DESx2 to mid LAD, he was immediately placed 
back on his aspirin and plavix. The patient was found to have 
some episodes of bradyacardia ranging from 38-54 in PACU but 
mentioned his baseline is approximately 42 as he is a long 
distance swimmer. He was asymptomatic.

Post-operatively, he did well without any neurologic deficits or 
neck swelling. He was able to tolerate a regular diet, get out 
of bed and ambulate without assistance, void without issues, and 
pain was controlled on oral medications alone. The night after 
the surgery, the patient experienced 24 runs of VTach and was 
asymtpomatic. Magnesium was 1.8 and was repleted. From vascular 
surgery standpoint, the patient was deemed ready for discharge 
on ___, but Eletrophysiology team was consulted to weigh 
in their opinion on the VTach episodes given his cardiac 
history. Electrophysiology saw the patient and did not believe 
to be an actual episode of VT, but a junctional rhythm. There 
were no further concerns and thought that the patient could be 
discharged from their standpoint. Blood pressure goals were 
110-140. On ___, the patient reached SBP of 160 and two 
doses of IV hydrazine 10mg were administered with temporary 
recovery of his blood pressure. Upon discharge, his blood 
pressure was 146/75. At that time, staples were removed from the 
left neck incision and steri-strips were placed. The patient was 
given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions and 
discharged home with ___ services for blood pressure checks and 
wound check to continue his recovery.
