Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman who is s/p a bypass 
from her right common iliac to her profunda femoris due to

worsening right leg claudication. She underwent a right redo 
femoral to below-the-knee popliteal bypass with CryoVein, and 
left arm exploration on ___. Her left arm vasculature was 
sufficient in size in the upper arm and in the midforearm but 
there was a significant portion of the vessel that appeared 
narrow and sclerotic therefore it was unusable and a Cyrovein 
was used for a conduit. The skin on her arm and right leg was 
closed with stables. She tolerated the procedure well with no 
complications. On POD1 her home medications were restarted and 
she was tolerating a normal diet with no nausea or vomiting. Her 
pain was well controlled. Her incision sites were clean, dry and 
intact and her feet were warm and well perfused. Distal 
extremity pulses were dopplerable bilaterally. On POD2 she was 
out of bed and ambulating, her pulse exam was stable and her 
wound dressings were removed. On POD3 she was walking around, 
she had a ___ evaluation which concluded that she could be 
discharged home without ___ followup. She was discharged with
