disorder protocol included daily standing weights and

nutritional intake. Likely inflammatory from malnutrition. 
Hepatitis serologies negative. Remained stable.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___.

You came to the hospital because you were restricting your diet 
and exercising very frequently, causing you to lose weight. This 
is a condition called anorexia nervosa, and it can be 
life-threatening.

In the hospital, you were closely monitored for the effects of 
anorexia (such as slow heart rate, low electrolytes). We helped 
you establish better eating habits and gave you supplements 
(such as phosphorus) to help prevent complications. You overall 
made good progress during your hospitalization.

Once it was safe, we discharged you with plans to fly home to 
___ where you can resume your treatment closer to home. 
Please work closely with your treatment team at home and 
continue taking your medications as prescribed. Please avoid 
exercise until you are told it is safe to do so. With this 
treatment we expect you will continue to improve and do well. 

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
