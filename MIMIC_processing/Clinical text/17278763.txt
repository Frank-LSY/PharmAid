History of Present Illness:
___ male ___ recent cardiac arrest thought ___ asystole 
from CHB, prior unprovoked PE not on AC, diverticulosis, 
cervical radiculopathy, presenting with referral from PCP office 
for DVT/PE.  
 Cardiac arrest occurred in ___ and ___ had just arrived 
back home yesterday, but reported ongoing chest pain and calf 
pain both of which were present basically as long as he 
remembers after he regained consciousness from his arrest around 
last ___ calf pain began last ___ perhaps. Chest pain 
is difficult to characterize as has pain from CPR, no pleuritic 
element. Some faint SOB which he says feels like deconditioning, 
otherwise no dyspnea. He underwent ___ and CTA chest which 
demonstrated DVT and 2 small PEs. Also endorses LUE pain. Has hx 
of prior DVT without provocation, not on AC. Patient reports 
getting SQH during his recent hospital stay as far as he 
remembers. Denies swelling of extremities, blood in BMs or 
urine.  
 Per PCP ___: "On ___ after jogging in ___ he went to a 
convenience store. Shortly after leaving the store he collapsed. 
This was witnessed. EMS was called and CPR was initiated. EKG 
showed complete heart block with a rate in the ___. He was given 
atropine and taken to the emergency room. Temporary external 
pacing was initiated, but it was difficult to maintain capture. 
He then developed asystole. He was intubated and continued to 
receive chest compressions. Transvenous pacer was placed, but it 
was also difficult to maintain capture. He was taken to cardiac 
catheter lab where a coronary angiogram showed normal coronary 
arteries and ejection fraction of 65%. The pacemaker wires were 
adjusted so that he had a good response. He was taken to the 
ICU. His blood pressure was low and he received dopamine for a 
while. He was somewhat difficult to ventilate initially. He 
developed a fever with mild leukocytosis and was treated briefly 
with Zosyn and vancomycin. He had a chest CT scan with PE 
protocol that was negative for PE, but showed basilar fluid 
collections. The following day he underwent pacemaker placement. 
He became fluid overloaded, and required diuresis. He received 
routine DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin. Ultimately he 
did well. He was discharged on ___  
 Patient had an unprovoked DVT in ___, with extensive 
workup not revealing any acute etiology. He was on Coumadin for 
6 months, and then stopped it at the behest of his doctor.  
 Past cardiology notes otherwise notable for syncopal episodes 
in ___ thought ___ sinus bradycardia, with unconcerning stress 
test and event monitor, as well as some dilated RV of unclear 
cause without concerning findings on MRI.  
 In the ED initial vitals were: 98.5 62 148/75 17 100% RA  
 Exam is unremarkable except for a cord palpable in left upper 
arm; pacemaker site seems to be healing well with steri-strips 
intact.  
 EKG: Paced rhythm, 61, left axis deviation, right bundle branch 
block, T-wave inversions in leads V1Â–3. Dr. ___ 
cardiologist) reviewed, TWI ant is new from prior but likely 
represents T-wave memory.  
 Labs/studies notable for:  
 Nl CBC (hb 12.2); Trop <0.01; lytes WNL (bicarb 20); coags nl  
 ___: DVT in L cephalic vein  
 Bedside V-scan - Likely old RV dilation not related to PE  
 Patient was given 4000u IV heparin bolus and started on a gtt, 
along with ASA 325.  
 Seen by at___ cardiologist who recommended admission for 
observation, heparin GTT overnight, transition to xarelto in AM 
if stable  
 Vitals on transfer: 128/77 60 18 98/RA  
 
 On the floor, patient reports some slight ongoing chest 
tightness without chest pain or SOB. No pain in the R calf or L 
arm.

any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, 
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted for a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in lung 
and right leg) and you were started on a blood thinner through 
the IV. This was transitioned to xerelto, which is a pill you 
need to take everyday (see instructions below). You were also 
found to have a blood clot in your left arm, but this is 
superficial and should improve over time. Please follow-up with 
your primary care physician and cardiologist as an outpatient.

It was a pleasure caring for you,

-___ medical care team
