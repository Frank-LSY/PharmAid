month;  this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or 
the indwelling ureteral stent (if there is one).

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter.; This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your
