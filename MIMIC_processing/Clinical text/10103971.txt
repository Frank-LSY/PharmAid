History of Present Illness:
___ year old Male transferred from ___ for concern of aortic 
dissection. The patient reports feeling well until 3 days prior 
to presentation when he returned from ___. He 
reports 3 days prior to admission he developed severe , sharp 
stabbing left sided back pain mostly at the lumbar level. He 
went to ___ and initially was diagnosed with 
musculoskeletal pain and sent out with pain medications. When 
this did not improve he returned to ___ ED where there was 
concern for an aortic dissection, so he underwent a CTA. By 
report the CTA was complicated by cardiac motion artifact, and 
they could not exclude an ascending aortic dissection so he was 
referred to ___ for cardiac surgery evaluation.  At ___ he 
received morphine without relief, along with Ativan presumably 
for muscle spasm. 

In the ___ ED his initial vitals signs were 98.3, 102, 149/97, 
18, 95%. In the ED her received numerous rounds of IV 
benzodiazopenes, diulaudid and ketorolac with relief mostly from 
the ketorolac. He also underwent gated CTA of the aorta here 
which was clear and did not demonstrate a dissection or 
aneurysm. CV surgery saw the patient in the ED and felt there 
was no need for surgical consultation given the absence of 
dissection.

The patient describes the pain as starting at his spine on the 
left side and radiating in a band like patter to his midline 
across the flank and abdomen. There is no radiation to the groin 
or testicals. Patient denies a rash on this area. The patient 
denies loss of bowel or bladder with the pain, although does 
note constipation with all the opioids he has received.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with past medical history of bilateral knee 
arthritis, presenting with acute onset left mid back pain, with 
imaging revealing multilevel degenerative changes throughout the 
spine, especially C5 through 7, T7 through 9, L1, and L4 through 
5, with disc protrusions and foraminal narrowing.

With conservative treatment the patient improved.  On the day of 
discharge he was able to move around sufficiently that he would 
be able to function at home.  I discussed his prognosis, the 
medication plan, the follow-up plan, with him and his wife at 
the bedside at length.  They had no additional questions.

#Acute back pain
#Multilevel degenerative spine changes
-Initially there was some concern for aortic dissection, or 
nephrolithiasis, but with multiple imaging studies neither of 
these, nor any other obvious etiology was found
-patient's acute back pain correlated with the thoracic findings 
on his MRI
-case discussed informally with ___ who felt that the 
patient's history and imaging as reported by me indicated no 
role for surgical intervention
-In the hospital received ketorolac, transition this to Naprosyn 
on discharge, continue standing acetaminophen, low-dose 
diazepam, and transitioned from IV hydromorphone to p.o.
oxycodone with good effect
-continue bowel regimen

#Elevated CRP
-This was of unclear etiology, but the patient had no other 
signs or symptoms of an autoimmune or rheumatological problem
-His current sources of inflammation include his bilateral 
chronic knee arthritis, is acute back pain, and his torn right 
quadriceps
-Reasonable to follow-up this issue as an outpatient, perhaps 
with a recheck of the CRP, and further testing at that time 
depending on his clinical context

#Mild anemia (Hb 12)
-reticulocyte count suggested a somewhat hypoproliferative 
process (it was 1.0), hemolysis labs were negative, and 
iron/ferritin and B12 are normal
Could be an inflammatory block (elevated CRP certainly suggest 
some inflammation), although the etiology of that is unclear as 
noted above
-Recommend outpatient follow-up

#Incidentally found 2.8 cm left thyroid nodule
-Nonurgent thyroid ultrasound as an outpatient, patient and wife 
are aware

#Incidentally discovered "Top-normal pulmonary artery diameter 
is equivocal for pulmonary arterial hypertension.  If clinically 
indicated, echocardiography could be performed to
evaluate pulmonary arterial pressures."
This was not clinically indicated during this admission, 
deferring to the outpatient setting for more evaluation

#Factor V Leiden
-No signs of thrombosis at this time, he had no vital sign 
abnormalities, no shortness of breath, no cough, and CTA chest 
showed no pulmonary embolism
-he is not on anticoagulation, but he is on aspirin 81 mg daily, 
which was continued on discharge

[x] The patient is safe to discharge today, and I spent [ ] 
<30min; [x] >30min in discharge day management services.
