History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is an ___ with HTN, gout, OA, BPH/elevated PSA, 
post-herpetic neuralgia, who presents with rectal bleeding.

He says he was in his usual state of good health until this 
morning, when he went to use the bathroom. He says he felt just 
fine, no increased abdominal pain or urgency, but when he moved 
his bowels he had a large volume diarrheal stool mixed with 
bright red blood. He thought he might have developed a dysentery 
because on ___ he ate about ___ of a sandwich that had been 
in his refrigerator for over a week, and he thought it tasted 
odd (which is why he only ended up eating half of it). He had no 
systemic symptoms, no actual abdominal pain, no n/v. Over the 
next few hours he moved his bowels 2 more times, each 
progressively more bloody, so he became concerned and decided to 
come to the ED.

Here, he had stable vital signs and generally reassuring 
laboratories. He had a CT scan that showed a possible sigmoid 
mass. He was given Zosyn because he endorsed possible exposure 
to rotten food. Admission was requested for further workup.

Imaging on admission: 
CTA Abdomen
**1. Ill-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass involving 4-5 cm 
of sigmoid colon with extension into the adjacent mesorectum and 
probable extramural vascular invasion, consistent with colonic 
carcinoma. Several adjacent nodes are suspicious, the largest of 
which measures 1.6 x 1.2 cm at the junction of the superior 
rectal and sigmoid arteries.**
2. No evidence of colonic ischemia.
3. Two peripherally enhancing lesions in segments 4b/5 of the 
liver measuring up to 17 x 17 mm, consistent with hepatic 
metastases.
4. A 10 mm hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left 
kidney is indeterminate. Attention on follow-up studies is 
recommended.
5. Other incidental intra-abdominal findings of cholelithiasis 
and marked prostatomegaly.
6. Bibasilar pulmonary nodules, measuring up to 9 mm in the 
lingula, also suspicious for metastatic disease. Attention on 
follow-up studies is recommended.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ with HTN, gout, OA, BPH/elevated PSA, 
post-herpetic neuralgia, who presents with rectal bleeding and 
was found to have a sigmoid mass s/p biopsy showing 
adenocarcinoma with likely mets to the liver and lungs.

# Rectal bleeding, likely bleeding from
# Metastatic colorectal Adenocarcinoma with likely liver and 
lung mets  
He presented with painless bleeding. Ct scan was obtained and 
was remarkable for Ill-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass 
involving 4-5 cm of sigmoid colon with extension into the 
adjacent mesorectum and probable extramural vascular invasion, 
consistent with colonic carcinoma. Several adjacent nodes are 
suspicious, the largest of which measures 1.6 x 1.2 cm at the 
junction of the superior rectal and sigmoid arteries. There were 
also several lesions seen in the liver concerning for 
metastasis. GI was consulted and he underwent a flex sig and 
multiple biopsies. The biopsy showed moderately differentiated 
adenocarcinoma. He was started on laxatives and with soft stool 
the bleeding resolved without intervention. Oncology was 
consulted and recommended CT chest for further staging. His CT 
chest was remarkable for likely metastatic disease to the lung 
as well. His Hgb was monitored and remained stable. He was 
started on iron. He will need close follow up with oncology to 
discuss options. They have set up this appointment for him.

scans to see if there was spread of the cancer. Unfortunately, 
like we discussed, lesions were seen in your liver and lungs 
very concerning for metastasis.
