look for risk factors. Patient was started on aspirin, and 
atorvastatin as prevention for recurrent stroke.

======================================
Mr. ___ is a ___ Year old Male with PMH of Hypertension, 
___ who is admitted to the Neurology stroke service 
with acute onset L sided weakness and decreased sensation 
secondary to an acute ischemic stroke likely in the anterior 
medulla. His stroke was most likely secondary to small vessel 
disease in the setting of hypertension, ___, obesity 
and hyperlipidemia vs. cardioembolism. His deficits improved 
greatly prior to discharge with mild residual left-sided 
weakness and mild decreased sensation to pinprick by 10% of 
baseline. Cervical imaging was negative for alternative 
compressive etiology. Patient's TTE indeterminate for PFO/ASD, 
and will be discharged on 4 weeks of telemetry/ziopatch to 
evaluate A-fib.

He will continue to home ___.

Your stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 5.9%
2) ___ intracranial atherosclerosis appreciated.
3) Hyperlipidemia: Started on Atorvastatin 80mg due to LDL of 
144.
4) Obesity
5) Concern for OSA (will need PSG)

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
1. Follow up with PCP about ___, HTN, HLD, obesity.
2. Follow up with stroke neurologist for management of risk 
factors, monitoring of possible aneurysm.
3. Consider repeat TTE to evaluate for PFO/ASD.
4. Consider sleep study for obstructive sleep apnea.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of sudden onset left sided 
weakness; resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:

Obesity, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, ___

We are changing your medications as follows:

Start Taking Daily 81mg Aspirin 
Start Taking Nightly 80mg Atorvastatin/Lipitor 
Start Taking HCTZ 12.5mg Daily, have your primary care provider 
continue to manage your hypertension.
Continue taking metformin 500mg twice a day, have primary care 
provider increase it to your previous dose of 1000mg BID.  

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:

- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
