episode of abd pain.

Difficult historian.

Pt reports almost ___ years of what she calls her "crises." They
occur ___ year (though in ___ she had an increase of up to
___ The typical pattern is that she has crampy abdominal pain
in either her LLQ or RLQ, the pain worsens and she becomes quite
bloated. The pain worsens and she goes to an ED and then needs 
to
be admitted and it takes ~4 days to get better. She has had
countless abdominal CT scans with different results (discussed
below). During the hospital stay she receives pain meds and then
she has liquid stools, not typically vomiting, and then all of a
sudden things improve and she is able to take POs and goes home.

Between episodes she has no pain and is able to eat and drink
without issue (though some dietary restrictions as below). She 
is
frustrated because she doesn't know what is going on. She is 
also
frustrated because she worries that doctors think she wants
narcotics.

She has been given many explanations during these
hospitalizations which she reports have been at every hospital 
in
the ___ area. Once it was thought to be gallbladder related
and she had a CCY. She has been treated several times for pelvic
inflammatory disease (at ___ per ___. Once at ___ she was told she had a bowel obstruction and received a 
NG
tube. Most recently 3 weeks ago in ___ (visiting a
relative and had an episode) she was told she had diverticulitis
and was given antibiotics though she never filled them.

She did see Dr. ___ at ___ in ___ and he 
suggested
there was an element of visceral hypersensivity. He was unsure 
of
the etiology but suggested a lactose tolerance test, porphyrins,
c1 prime esterase assay, lead toxicity, and said it was possibly
cocaine related. 

The patient wonders whether it is food related. She limits fat 
in
her diet, no longer takes carbohydrates, is lactose free, and
does not take beans/rice. Overall she feels these dietary 
changes
have been helpful as she has had only two episodes of pain this
year (3 weeks ago and this episode) and has lost significant
weight and her diabetes is better controlled. 

She presents left quadrant abdominal pain x 1 day  She states 
the
pain started gradually, baseline dull, but with periods of
cramping sharp pain. It has progressively worsened over the
course over yesterday. She has nausea without emesis and watery
stool yesterday morning, but has formed stool was 4 days prior 
to
that. 

Denies fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue,
dizziness, weakness, hematemesis, BRBPR.

She says that she had a relapse of her cocaine use ~3 weeks ago.
Her episode in ___ could have been related to eating a
small amount of a fatty meal, but nothing recently.

12 pt ROS: 
Otherwise negative except she also reports urinary frequency and
dysuria. 

She had two abd CT one at 2am and one at 8am. 
2am: Focal mildly dilated loops of small bowel in the mid and
left lower abdomen  with decompressed loops distally and a
possible transition in the mid abdomen (series 601b, image 33),
findings are potentially concerning for early or partial small
bowel obstruction. 

8am: Essentially normal study with resolution of previously 
noted
focal small bowel distention in the left lower abdomen.  NG tube
positioned appropriately. 

In ED she was evaluated by ACS who felt conservative management
was indicated. She was given:
Fentanyl 50mcg
Ativan 1mg
Tylneol IV 1000mg
Dilaudid x 2 - 1mg 

She is unsure why but NG tube was removed. 

When she arrived on floor she complained of ___ abdominal 
pain.
When I saw her after receiving one dose of dilaudid, she felt
much better ___ pain and was comfortable.
