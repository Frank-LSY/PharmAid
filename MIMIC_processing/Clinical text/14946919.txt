Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
Right radical
nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; 
please see dictated operative note for details. The patient 
received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient was 
transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable condition. On

>30cc/hour, provided with pneumoboots and incentive spirometry 
for prophylaxis, and ambulated once.  

 

On POD1, the patient was restarted on home medications, basic 
metabolic panel and complete blood count were checked, pain 
control was transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was 
advanced to a clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, urethral 
Foley catheter was removed without difficulty and diet was 
advanced as tolerated. The remainder of the hospital course was 
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable 
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding 
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On 
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit
