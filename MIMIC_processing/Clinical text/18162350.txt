Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was transferred and admitted to ___ after a 
mechanical fall with amnesia to event, + headstrike, and unclear 
loss of consciousness. He had right cheek facial laceration that 
had been sutured at ___ and CT imaging: CT head, C 
spine, left lower extremity and maxillofacial. The CT head with 
bilateral fluid collections concerning for hygroma vs ___, CT 
LLE found soft tissue swelling and OA but no fracture,(negative 
L ankle plain film), Max-face found a fracture in the right 
maxillary sinus with possible right orbital floor involvement. 
CT cervical spine read a question of partial subluxation of 
right lateral mass of C2 with respect to C1. There was concern 
for a SDH, and he was transferred for neurosurgical evaluation. 
    Neurosurgery evaluated Mr. ___ in the ER, for concern for 
___ hygromas versus subdural hematoma and incidental possible ICA 
aneurysm. He had a CTA head and neck which was interpreted to 
show bilateral subdural hygromas, unchanged from the previous 
scan with no evidence of aneurysm, hemorrhage, or infarct. Their 
recommendations were no need for repeat imaging or 
antiepileptics, and may restart subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis 
in 24 hours and home aspirin without need for follow up with 
neurosurgery. 
    For his CT C spine findings, orthopedic spine surgery was 
consulted and evaluated for possible C1-2 subluxation, which 
they felt was an artifact and related to patient positioning 
based on imaging review and assessment. 
 Plastic surgery felt there was no appreciable facial fracture 
on review of the CT scan and needed no intervention. He had no 
extraocular motion abnormalities or facial nerve paresthesias. 
He was admitted to the trauma surgery service for pain control 
and evaluation by physical and occupational therapy. ___ and OT 
evaluated Mr. ___ on HD2, and both services recommended he 
return home with 24 hour surveillance and home physical and 
occupational therapy services. 
 The gerontology team was consulted as he became confused 
overnight requiring pharmacological intervention with Haldol and 
his history of falls. He had no evidence of urinary tract 
infection. He was found to have mild cognitive impairment/ 
dementia but no delirium, and was recommended to be re-evaluated 
by his primary care doctor after he was back to his normal 
environment and routine. He was instructed not to drive, and to 
wear his hearing aids and glasses. 
  His son came to visit him and was in contact with the ___ team 
on multiple occasions. He ensured that his father would have 
___ supervision at his assisted living facility, and would have 
___ and OT. Case management was involved with his discharge. He 
was discharged to have follow up with his primary care doctor 
for suture removal and further cognitive evaluation.  He was 
also set to have visiting nursing for blood pressure monitoring 
to rule out orthostatic hypotension per gerontology 
recommendations as a possible contributing factor for falls.
   The patient and his son were in agreement with plan for 
discharge to his facility with follow up with his primary care 
physician within ___ few days.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ after 
your fall, for pain control, physical therapy evaluation, and 
examination by subspecialty teams. You went to ___ for 
initial evaluation, and were transferred to ___ for 
further evaluation based on your CT scan findings after they 
repaired your facial laceration with stitches. At ___, the 
Neurosurgery team saw you for fluid in your brain that they felt 
was chronic and does not need any interventions. The first scan 
appeared to have a possible ICA aneurysm, and you had a repeat 
scan that they felt did not show evidence of an aneurysm. You do 
not need to follow up with the neurosurgery team. 

  You also had imaging that was concerning for cervical spine 
findings, and the orthopedic spine team assessed you in the 
Emergency Department. They looked over your imaging and felt 
what was seen was due to the position the image was taken in. 
You have no symptoms and do not need any interventions. 

  You were also seen by Plastic Surgery for concern for possible 
facial fracture on one of your scans at ___. They 
evaluation found no evidence of fracture on imaging, and your 
eye motion and nerves in your face are normal. There is no 
intervention or need to follow up with the plastic surgery team. 


 The geriatric medicine team evaluated you after you were 
confused overnight and needed medication to help you feel calm.  
Their evaluation showed you may have mild cognitive impairment 
but no delirium. They recommend you wear your lifeline, hearing 
aids, and glasses when you get home to your facility. You should 
not drive until you are evaluated again by your primary care 
doctor and cleared. Your primary care doctor should also 
re-evaluate your memory tests because the results may change 
when you are back to your normal environment and routine, and 
have your glasses and hearing aids. You will have visiting 
nurses to help check your blood pressure, and have physical 
therapy at your facility. 

The physical and occupational therapists worked with you, and 
the therapists felt you can go back to your facility with 
someone there with you 24 hours a day and get home physical and 
occupational therapy. Your son and you felt you would have 24 
hour surveillance with your son, wife, and the assisted living 
facility staff. 

Remember you need to have your facial stitches taken out in 5- 7 
days. You should make an appointment with your primary care 
doctor for follow up after your fall. They should be able to 
remove your stitches and can repeat your cognitive testing. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive. You should not drive until cleared by your 
primary care physician. 
- You should continue to walk several times a day with your 
walker, and follow the instructions from the physical and 
occupational therapists. You will continue your therapies at 
your assisted living facility.  
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Remember to wear your hearing aids, glasses, and life line. 
You should have someone with you at home 24 hours a day. 

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- Your pain has been well controlled with Tylenol and you have 
not needed any stronger medication. You should continue to take 
the acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed, not to exceed 3000mg per 
day total. You may take it regularly for a few days and then 
skip a dose or increase time between doses if you are not having 
pain until you no longer need it. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
-You may shower with your stitches in place. You can let the 
water run over your face, but do not soak or scrub. Pat gently 
dry. Do not soak with your sutures submerged or swim for 3 weeks 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site,
