History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ right-handed woman who presents as a transfer 
from OSH with a 1 day history of severe headache with concern 
for spontaneous right carotid dissection and right frontal 
stroke.

History gathered from the patient and family.

Essentially, prior to 2 days ago, she was in her baseline state 
of health and doing well.  Starting 2 days ago, with no clear 
onset, she felt like her left hand was "clumsy", "like it wasn't 
doing what I wanted it to do".  It was not weakness and her 
provided example is that she would have trouble letting go of 
objects.  There were no symptoms in the right hand at that time.

The next day (yesterday), she reported onset of bilateral 
tingling of her bilatereally hands, from the wrists down.  It 
involved front and back with no clear distribution.  She spoke 
with a physician colleague, who suggested she may have carpal 
tunnel.  Prior to this day, she never had sensory symptoms in 
her hands.

This morning she awoke (or developed very shortly after 
awakening) a "terrible" bifrontal headache.  She cannot describe 
its nature.  It was associated with nausea and photophobia.  She 
never had a headache like this before.  She attempted to go to 
work (and in fact drove herself).  However the headache was too 
severe and she was referred to the ED.

There, she underwent evaluation  which included an NCHCT 
suggestive of right frontal ischemia.  Subsequent imaging, 
including MRI and CTA were notable for concern of a right 
carotid dissection and right frontal ischemia.  Though details 
are unclear, she may have transiently been on a heparin drip for 
this before being transitioned to Aspirin.  She was subsequently 
transferred here for further evaluation.

Of note, Mrs. ___ denies recent trauma, deep tissue massage, 
chiropractic work, or unusual head positioning.  She does 
however endorse an on and off strong cough since ___.  She 
is currently being treated for bronchitis with doxycycline and 
prednisone taper.

ROS notable for recent fevers, cough, rhinorrhea and associated 
URI symptoms.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, 
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or 
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness, 
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. 
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent chills.  
Denies shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, 
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. 
 No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

IMAGING STUDIES
===============
___ SECOND OPINION CT NEURO 
1. Findings concerning for carotid dissection, affecting the 
length of the 
internal carotid artery from above the carotid bifurcation to 
the cavernous sinus. 
2. Left internal carotid artery is without occlusion or 
significant stenosis by NASCET criteria. 
3. Left dominant vertebral arterial system the is likely 
congenital. 
4. Rounded right frontal hypodensity with sulcal effacement and 
paucity of 
enhancement corresponds to region of slow diffusion on prior MRI 
examination. 
5. Maxillary sinus inflammatory disease. 
.
___ Cardiovascular ECHO 
The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus/mass is seen in 
the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect or patent 
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast 
with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased 
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. 
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass 
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.
.
___ CXR CHEST (PA & LAT) 
No focal consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia.  
Peribronchial wall 
thickening is suggestive of acute bronchitis in the appropriate 
clinical 
setting. 
.
___ SECOND OPINION MR NEURO 
1. Late acute right frontal lobe cortical infarction corresponds 
to area of decreased vascularity on the concurrently obtained 
CTA.  Focal gyral enlargement is likely secondary to cytotoxic 
edema. 
2. Other small infarctions are scattered throughout the corona 
radiata and 
centrum semiovale on the right. 
3. No pathologic postcontrast enhancement. 
4. There are nonspecific periventricular and subcortical 
T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensities, a few which are 
associated with T1 CSF intensity tubular foci.  Differential 
considerations in a patient of this age is broad and may 
represent sequela of chronic microangiopathy, prior trauma or 
infectious/inflammatory etiology.  While demyelinating process 
is not entirely excluded, the distribution is not typically. 
.
___ MRA NECK W&W/O CONTRAST 
Extremely limited MRA examination.  Occlusion or extreme slow 
flow within the right internal carotid artery.  No evidence of 
dissection.  Flow signal present in the left internal carotid 
and both vertebral arteries without detailed assessment. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
===============
___ is a ___ right-handed woman who presents as a transfer 
from OSH with a 1 day history of severe headache with concern 
for spontaneous right carotid dissection vs thrombosis and right 
frontal stroke. Her only possible insult to cause dissection by 
history was a severe cough being treated for bronchitis as an 
outpatient. Her exam was notable for significant headache with 
discomfort, mild LUE UMN pattern weakness and subtle slowness 
with her left hand.  
.
MRI and CTA imaging prior to this hospitalization was notable 
for a long segment of right carotid occlusion and right frontal 
ischemia. On review with ___ radiologists overnight, there was 
no evidence to suggest a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Given 
the extent of her carotid occlusion and risk of clinical 
decompensation, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. 
She was started on dual anti-platelet therapy with Plavix and 
aspirin. 
.
During her admission, her headache improved and she reported no 
other focal neurologic deficits. ECHO showed no clear source of 
a cardiogenic emboli and no PFO. Second opinion reads were 
obtained on the head and neck CTA which was read as "concerning 
for dissection". However, an MRA was performed to more 
accurately assess for dissection as opposed to thrombosis. This 
study was severely degraded by motion - there was no evidence of 
dissection on this study and it confirmed Occlusion or extreme 
slow flow within the right internal carotid artery. 
.
Therefore, it was still unclear by the time of discharge if the 
patient had a spontaneous dissection vs a long segment of 
thrombosis/occlusion of the ICA. Therefore, hypercoagulable 
workup was sent but was missing Protein C/S and Factor 5 leiden 
as these could not be sent as an inpatient. She will also be 
sent out with ___ of hearts monitor for 14 days to evaluate 
for atrial fibrillation as a cause of cardioembolic source. 
.
Remaining risk factors were sent and revealed 
hypercholesterolemia with fasting lipids: Chol 227, Trig 287, 
LDL 128. She was started on Atorvastatin 80mg daily for this as 
well as to stabilize her carotid plaque. Her HbA1C was 
borderline at 6.1% and this should be followed by her primary 
care provider. 
.
At the time of discharge, her ___ neg, C3 and C4 wnl, ___, 
Sed rate 9, CRP 11. 
.
She was ordered for a repeat MRA neck with fat saturations 
before a three month follow up appointment with stroke 
neurology. 
.
She was scheduled for stroke follow up and counseled extensively 
on smoking cessation, prediabetes, and the need for follow up. 
She worked with physical therapy who suggested outpatient 
occupational and physical therapy. She was also counseled to 
avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activity, and contact sports for 
six months and avoiding airplane travel for 1 month. 
.
Of note, on her initial exam, she had a positive tinels at her 
wrist and elbow suggestive of ulnar and median compressive 
neuropathy. This can be further evaluated and treated as an 
outpatient. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
 - Follow-up auto-immune studies and coagulopathy studies
 - Send Protein C, Protein S, Factor 5 Leiden as outpatient to 
complete hypercoag workup
 - Started Aspirin and Plavix 
 - In 3 months (___), can discontinue Plavix for aspirin 
monotherapy
 - Repeat MRA fat sat before 3 month appointment.
 - Elevated HbA1C
 - Elevated LDL - started Atorvastatin 80mg QHS
 - Outpatient EMG for likely median and ulnar neuropathy
 - ___ of hearts for 14 days. 
 - Counseled on smoking cessation - gave rx for nicotine patch

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,  
 
___ were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache resulting from 
a carotid artery blockage and an acute ischemic stroke. This 
blockage was caused by either a clot or a dissection. A clot 
could have formed in your artery from atherosclerosis or it 
could have come from another location, like your heart. A 
dissection occurs when one of the blood vessels supplying the 
brain is injured and blood flow that normally supplies the brain 
is prevented from flowing normally. Dissections can lead to the 
formation clots that traveled from the blockage to the brain. 
While the brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, fortunately the clot 
traveled to a portion of the brain that does not cause 
significant deficits. 
 
The imaging that we obtained did not clearly distinguish between 
a clot or a dissection - however, the acute treatment is the 
same. 

We started treating ___ with both aspirin and clopidogrel 
(Plavix) for the next three months to treat he blockage. After 
this time ___ should follow-up with your neurologist, but likely 
___ will remain on aspirin for the foreseeable future. We also 
started treating ___ with a statin based on your high 
cholesterol levels. The statin will help prevent strokes in the 
future. If the drug causes considerable side effects, ___ should 
talk to your PCP about changing this for another type of 
cholesterol medication. 

To workup causes of the clot, we have sent many lab tests to 
check for hypercoagulability. Your cholesterol 227, Trig 287, 
LDL 128. Your HbA1C was 6.1% which is borderline for diabetes 
and should be followed up by your primary care doctor. ___ were 
set up with a cardiac monitor to monitor for atrial 
fibrillation. 

Please do not lift more than 20 lbs, play contact sports, 
perform strenuous activity for 6 months. ___ should also not fly 
on an airplain for 1 month. Avoiding these activities will 
prevent worsening of a dissection. 

___ had some signs of carpal tunnel on your exam and may benefit 
from outpatient nerve conduction study/EMG. 

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as described below.  
 
If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
___  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

It was a pleasure taking part in your care,
