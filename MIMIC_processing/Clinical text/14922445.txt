Pertinent Results:
=============
IMAGING
=============

___ MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O C
1. Multilevel multifactorial cervical spondylosis as described 
above, 
resulting in severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing 
spanning C3-C4 
through C5-C6, unchanged from prior examination. 
2. There is moderate spinal canal narrowing at C5-C6 and C6-C7, 
also unchanged from prior exam without evidence of underlying 
cord signal abnormality. 
3. T2 hyperintense cystic lesion of the right lower neck 
measuring 
approximately 3.2 cm in greatest dimension, likely representing 
sebaceous 
cyst.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  This could be 
further evaluated with ultrasound as clinically 

___ CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)
Evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Probable 
small hiatal 
hernia.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

___ C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA ___ 
No previous images.  There is some loss of the normal cervical 
lordosis.  
Hypertrophic spurring with intervertebral disc space narrowing 
is most 
prominent at C3-C4, C5-C6, and C6-C7.  No evidence of 
prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  Flexion extension views show 
no appreciable displacement.
