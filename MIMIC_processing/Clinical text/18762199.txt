Brief Hospital Course:
#Expanding L chronic SDH with cerebral compression 
Mr. ___ is a ___ M with known chronic L SDH after MVC 7 
weeks prior to presentation. He reported to his PCP for 
worsening symptoms, balance difficulties, and headaches. A 
routine head CT showed expansion of the SDH to 2.5cm. Patient 
presented to the ED for neurosurgical evaluation and was taken 
to the OR for L burr holes for evacuation of the SDH. A drain 
was left in place to EVD set up. Please see separately dictated 
operative report for complete details of the procedure. He was 
extubated in the OR and transferred to the PACU for recovery 
where he remained hemodynamically and neurologically stable. A 
post-op head CT showed tip of catheter in area of pneumocephalus 
and otherwise expected post-op changes without midline shift. 
Patient's HOB was elevated to promote output with good effect. A 
repeat head CT was performed on ___ and showed slight decrease 
in SDH. Patient's drain was removed without difficulty and 4 
staples were placed at post-drain site. Patient's activity was 
liberalized after drain removal. Patient mobilized on the unit 
independently and did not require evaluations from ___ or OT. His 
medications were reviewed at discharge. He was advised to 
continue Keppra for total 7 days. He was advised to hold all 
supplements including glucosamine chondroitin until follow-up 
and neurosurgery clearance. He was advised not to take aspirin 
and reported he does not plan to resume it at all. He was given 
follow-up instructions for staple removal and CT as well as 
wound care. He and his wife expressed understanding of all the 
above. He was discharged to home on ___ with his wife.
