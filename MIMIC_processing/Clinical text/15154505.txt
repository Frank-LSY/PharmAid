History of Present Illness:
HPI(4): Dr. ___ is a ___ male with the past medical 
history noted below who presents status post ERCP for routine 
monitoring.  The patient reports that he was in his usual state 
of health but over the last several months he has 3 episodes of 
extreme indigestion.  Reports that the last episode of 
indigestion led to uncontrollable shaking that lasted for about 
30 minutes.  He reported this to his primary care doctor 
rechecks labs and ultimately recommended a right upper quadrant 
ultrasound.  The right upper quadrant ultrasound was concerning 
for biliary obstruction and so he went forward with an MRCP 
which showed 2 stones in the distal common bile duct.  Given 
this he was referred to ERCP for ERCP with sphincterotomy and 
stone extraction.

He presented on ___ as an outpatient for 
scheduled ERCP.  The procedure was uncomplicated and 2 stones 
were extracted.  A sphincterotomy was performed.  Following the 
procedure the patient reports that he is feeling well.  He has

ERCP Report:
Medications: Monitored care anesthesia 
Indomethacin 100mg PR
total dose-226.93, tdap-59.923, total time-3.5min 
 
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential 
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his 
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A 
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered MAC 
anesthesia. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus 
position and an endoscope was introduced and advanced under 
direct visualization until the cecum was reached. Careful 
visualization was performed. The procedure was not difficult. 
The quality of the preparation was good. The patient tolerated 
the procedure well. There were no complications. 
Findings: 
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal 
 
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal 
 
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal 
 
Major Papilla: The major papilla appeared normal.  

Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and 
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast 
medium was injected resulting in complete opacification. The 
procedure was not difficult.  
 

Biliary Tree/Fluoroscopic interpretation: The scout film was 
normal. The major papilla appeared normal. The bile duct was 
successfully cannulated using a Rx sphincterotome preloaded with 
0.035in guidewire. Contrast was injected and there was brisk 
flow through the ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary 
tree. Contrast injection revealed two large filling defects in 
the higher third CBD consistent with stones as well as a CBD, 
CHD and IH duct dilatation. The CBD was measured at 11mm. A 
biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed with the 
sphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. The 
sphincterotome was exchanged for a CRE balloon. A biliary 
sphincteroplasty was successfully performed using a 10-12mm CRE 
balloon up to 12mm. The biliary tree was then swept with a 
9-12mm balloon starting at the bifurcation. Two large stones and 
sludge were successfully removed. The CBD and CHD were swept 
repeatedly until no further stones were seen. The final 
occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling defects in 
the CBD. Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen 
endoscopically and fluoroscopically.  

Pancreas: The PD was not injected or cannulated. I supervised 
the acquisition and interpretation of the fluoroscopic images. 
The quality of the fluoroscopic images was good.  

Impression: The scout film was normal. The major papilla 
appeared normal. 
The bile duct was successfully cannulated using a Rx 
sphincterotome preloaded with 0.035in guidewire. Contrast was 
injected and there was brisk flow through the ducts. Contrast 
extended to the entire biliary tree. 
Contrast injection revealed two large filling defects in the 
higher third CBD consistent with stones as well as a CBD, CHD 
and IH duct dilatation. The CBD was measured at 11mm. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed with the 
sphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
The sphincterotome was exchanged for a CRE balloon. A biliary 
sphincteroplasty was successfully performed using a 10-12mm CRE 
balloon up to 12mm. 
The biliary tree was then swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting 
at the bifurcation. Two large stones and sludge were 
successfully removed. 
The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones 
were seen. The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence 
of filling defects in the CBD.
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically. 
 

Recommendations: Follow for response and complications. If any 
abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding 
please call Advanced Endoscopy Fellow on call ___ 
(___).
Admit to hospital for monitoring.
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 
cc/hr.
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated.
Continue with antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 3 days.
Follow-up with referring physician as previously scheduled.
