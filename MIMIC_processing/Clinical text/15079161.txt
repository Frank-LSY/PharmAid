Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC:
#On admission to the inpatient psychiatric unit, patient was 
dysphoric, tearful, and stated that he had had intermittent 
suicidal ideation over the past week. He stated that he was 
willing to receive care, but that he did not feel that he needed 
to be in an inpatient psychiatric unit. He signed a Conditional 
Voluntary agreement, but soon after signed a three-day notice.

During hospitalization, patient met daily with the team to 
discuss his ongoing symptoms and the triggers leading up to 
hospitalization. He received individual, group, and milieu 
therapy. He was able to endorse adjustment to the ___, 
increased independence being in college and in a new country on 
his own, and particularly his difficult relationship with his 
female friend as being the main contributors to his depressed 
mood and suicidal ideation. He refused any medications, as he 
felt that taking medications would not be consistent with his 
beliefs, or the beliefs of his parents. He did accept Vistaril 
for insomnia and anxiety, with good effect.

On discharge, mood was "better," and mental status exam was 
significant for brighter affect, linear, goal-directed thought 
process, intact cognition, and denial of any suicidal thought, 
intention, or plan.

SAFETY: The patient remained in good behavioral control 
throughout this hospitalization and did not require physical or 
chemical restraint. The patient remained on 15 minute checks, 
which is our lowest acuity level of checks.

GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
#) Burn wound: On left inner forearm, self-inflicted with 
lighter. Bacitracin was applied twice daily to burn wounds.
-Continue Bacitracin ointment application BID
-F/u with PCP as needed

PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) MILIEU/GROUPS: The patient was somewhat isolative, though he 
did spend some time reading in the day room. He was visible in 
the milieu, but was seldom seen interacting with peers. He did 
not attend groups, stating that he did not believe he would 
benefit from them. He never engaged in any unsafe behaviors. He 
ate meals in the milieu, slept well, and cooperated with unit 
rules.

#) FAMILY CONTACTS: Family meetings were held with the patient's 
parents, and were notable for increasing communication and 
understanding of the severity of the patient's symptoms, 
particularly his self-injurious behavior. His parents understand 
and are in agreement with the current treatment and discharge 
plan. 

#) COLLATERAL: Collaborated with ___ throughout 
the admission. They agree with current treatment and discharge 
plan.

LEGAL STATUS: Patient signed a three-day notice, which expired 
on day of discharge.

RISK ASSESSMENT: 
This patient is not currently abusing subtances, is not suicidal 
or homicidal, is feeling well and is animated, euthymic, and 
participatory in the milieu, all of which indicate a low 
immediate risk of harm.
Static risk factors include:
-Impulsive tendencies, immigration status
Modifiable risk factors include:
-hopelessness, active polysubstance abuse, limited social 
support, sense of isolation, active SI
We modified these risks by increasing the patient's insight 
surrounding the seriousness of his actions, and engaging him 
fully in care, particularly surrounding his polysubstance use 
and its risk.
Protective factors include:
-strong connections to family, lack of financial stressors, 
help-seeking behavior
Current risk is low for intentional self-harm given that the 
patient denies suicial ideation, intent, and plan, is accepting 
of treatment, is currently sober, and is future oriented with 
plans to return to school and continue his ___ degree.

INFORMED CONSENT:
I discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, and 
possible side effects of this medication, and risks and benefits 
of possible alternatives, including not taking the medication, 
with the patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take this medicaiton as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any questions about medications with the treatment team, and I 
answered the patient's questions. The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

PROGNOSIS:
The patient's prognosis is good, due to the fact that he has no 
prior suicide attempts, no prior episodes of self-injurious 
behavior, and no prior hospitalizations. He is willing to engage 
in outpatient treatment, is currently sober, and refuses 
suicidal ideation, intent, or plan.
