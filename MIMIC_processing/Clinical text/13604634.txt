History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old R-handed man who presents as post TPA
transfer from ___ for likely posterior circulation stroke. 

He was in normal state of health until around 7:45AM when he
noted sudden onset vertical+horizontal diplopia with left sided
image above the right. He went to the ___ at that
point and ___ showed no bleed or hypodensity and CTA H and N
showed open vessels. He was seen by our telestroke department at

___
No atrial septal defect is seen on color flow Doppler, but there 
is early appearance of agitated saline/microbubbles in the left 
atrium/ventricle at rest most consistent with an atrial septal 
defect or stretched patent foramen ovale (though a very proximal 
intrapulmonary shunt cannot be fully excluded). The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Normal left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (3D LVEF = 
58 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with 
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: ASD/stretched PFO present.  

___ Head w/o contrast
Restricted diffusion is seen within the left thalamus, with 
extension to the superior margin of the left cerebral peduncle, 
with associated FLAIR signal abnormality concerning for a acute 
to subacute infarct.  There is no associated intracranial 
hemorrhage.  Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and 
configuration.  The visualized vascular flow voids appear to be 
well preserved.  Mild mucosal sinus thickening is seen involving 
the ethmoid air cells.  Partial opacification is seen involving 
the left mastoid air cells. 
  
The globes are unremarkable.  No marrow signal abnormalities are 
identified.  
No marrow signal abnormalities are identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Restricted diffusion within the left thalamus, with extension 
to the 
superior margin of left cerebral peduncle with associated FLAIR 
signal 
abnormality, secondary to an acute to subacute infarct.  No 
associated 
intracranial hemorrhage identified. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to ___ after receiving tPA at OSH. 
Repeat CT/CTA performed was negative for any acute infarct. Most 
of patient's symptoms were seen to resolve except for continued 
lower extremity weakness and some visual field deficit. Echo was 
performed which showed small PFO/ASD. Patient was started on 
aspirin therapy. MRI Brain showed infarct in Left Thalamus. 
Lower extremity dopplers were performed which were negative (MRV 
of the pelvis must be done as an out patient). Due to appearing 
clinically stable, patient will be discharged from the hospital 
with Neurology follow up and continued physical therapy at ___ 
___.

Transition Issues:
-Patient will need to follow up with Neurology (Dr. ___ as 
outpatient
-Patient will need to undergo ___ of Hearts monitoring to 
determine if there is a paroxysmal arrhythmia
- Pt needs to return to ___ for MRV of the pelvis as soon as 
possible.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of R sided weakness and 
visual changes resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors.
We are changing your medications as follows:  
Please start taking Aspirin 81mg daily.

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below. You will be contacted by our ___ 
program to arrange for an event monitor to evaluate for possible 
cardiac arrhythmia that may have precipitated this event. If 
need to contact, please call ___. 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
