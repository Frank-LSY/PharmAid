___:  CXR:

. No acute intrathoracic process. 
2. The fracture of the left lateral ninth rib, seen on 
subsequent CT chest, is not visualized on this radiograph and 
likely just outside the field of view. 

___:  CT sinus:

1. Mildly displaced nasal bone fracture and mildly angulated 
nasal septal 
fracture.  No additional fracture is identified. 
2. Left pre-septal soft tissue swelling without orbital hematoma 
or disruption of the bony orbit. 
3. Left scalp hematoma is partially imaged.

___: 

CT chest with contrast:

1. Mildly displaced fracture of the left ninth rib. 
2. Questionable nondisplaced fracture of the right T11 
transverse process.  Correlate with physical exam. 
3. Otherwise, no evidence of traumatic injury within the chest, 
abdomen, or pelvis.  No evidence of solid organ injury. 
4. The bladder is extremely distended, correlate with ability to 
urinate to exclude urinary retention. 

___:  CT head:

1. No evidence of calvarial fracture or intracranial hemorrhage. 

2. Mildly displaced nasal bone fracture and mildly angulated 
nasal septal 
fracture. 
3. Soft tissue stranding and scalp hematoma overlying the left 
lateral 
convexity and extending to the vertex, measuring at least 9.9 x 
1.6 cm. 
4. There is hypodensity in the bilateral globus pallidus which 
is 
age-indeterminate and could reflect toxic/metabolic injury. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an OSH after an assualt and 
MVC.  She was found to have mildly displaced nasal bone 
fracture, nasal septal fracture, scalp hematoma 9.9cm, minimally 
displace 9th rib fracture, and T11 non-displaced transverse 
process fracture on Pan CT scanning. Ophthalmology and plastic 
surgery were consulted and found that she had no immediate acute 
needs. Plastics surgery had recommended sinus precautions.   
Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was managed with tylenol, ibuprofen, and 
oxycodone.  
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient started on CLD and advanced to regular 
diet, which was well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were 
closely monitored.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan. She is to follow up with an 
ophthalmology outpatient and plastic surgery outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
___ year old female admitted to the hospital with nasal bone 
fracture, rib, and spine fracture related to domestic violence 
dispute.  Because of your injuries, you were evaluated by the 
Spine service.  You were also seen by Social services and Center 
for community violence.   Arrangements for discharge were 
discussed with the ___ Community violence and you are 
being discharged with the following instructions,  you were 
reported to have a nasal bone fracture and sinus precautions 
have been recommended.  You re being discharged with the 
following instructions: 

 Because of the close relationship between the upper back teeth 
and the sinus, a communication between the sinus and the mouth 
sometimes results from surgery. This condition has occurred in 
your case, which often heals slowly and with difficulty. Certain 
precautions will assist healing and we ask that you faithfully 
follow these instructions:

1. Take the prescribed medications as directed.

2. Do not forcefully spit for several days.

3. Do not smoke for several days.

4. Do not use straws for several days.

5. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even 
though your sinus may feel stuffy or there may be some nasal 
drainage.

6. Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If 
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

7. Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew 
on the opposite side of your mouth.

8. Do not rinse vigorously for several days. GENTLE salt water 
swishes may be used. Slight bleeding from the nose is not 
uncommon for several days after the surgery. Please keep our 
office advised of any changes in your condition, especially if 
drainage or pain increases. It is important that you keep all 
future appointments until this condition has resolved.

Additional instructions include: 

 Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the 
Emergency Department for any of the following:

*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or 
tightness.

*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
