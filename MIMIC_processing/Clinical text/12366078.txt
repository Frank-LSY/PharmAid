Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course - PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing robotic 
assisted laparoscopic left partial nephrectomy. No concerning 
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative 
note for details.
The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient 
ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. The patient was continued on 
fluid resuscitation for low urine output which improved 
overnight. On POD2, JP and urethral Foley catheter were removed 
without difficulty and diet was advanced as tolerated. The 
remainder of the hospital course was relatively unremarkable. 
The patient was discharged in stable condition, eating well, 
ambulating independently, voiding without difficulty, and with 
pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, 
dry, and intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection or 
infection. The patient was given explicit instructions to 
follow-up in clinic in approximately four weeks time.
