Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history osteoporosis, depression, anxiety,
who presented with chest pain that woke her up from sleep, found 
to have ST elevations in anterolateral leads s/p cardiac 
catheterization with no evidence of coronary artery disease; TTE 
revealed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She admits to increased 
anxiety in her life recently, but is unable to relate it to a 
specific event. She continued to have chest pain with 
inspiration over next ___ hours managed with Tylenol. She was 
uncomfortable taking deep breathes and was limited by pain. That 
pain has resolved. She also had low grade fever which improved 
with aggressive pulmonary toileting, increased activity and use 
of incentive spirometer. Her blood
pressures have been soft with mild dizziness requiring small NS 
IV bolus yesterday of 250cc.  This morning her SBP was greater 
than 100 and she was able to get 2.5 mg of lisinopril and 12.5 
mg of metoprolol tartrate per parameters.  Within a few hours 
her blood pressure was 89/53 and she had mild dizziness.  She 
increased her p.o. fluid intake and her symptoms resolved.  She 
is now ambulating without
any symptoms.  As per Dr. ___ will send her home with 
metoprolol succinate 12.5mg daily only and stop the lisinopril.  
Also to note her hemoglobin is 10.4 today with hematocrit 31.3 
and platelets 133.  These have been down trending since starting 
on Lovenox and Coumadin.  The Lovenox was discontinued and she 
will continue on Coumadin 5mg daily and have INR checked on 
___. Her INR was 1.5 today and will not be 
bridged per Dr. ___ due to concerns of her down trending H/H 
and platelets. She will also have a CBC checked that same day 
with results to Dr. ___ PCP. She has no evidence of 
bleeding. She will ___ with her PCP as scheduled and was 
encouraged to consider stress management options.

pressure. Her blood pressure was better this morning with SBP 
greater than 100 and got 12.5 of metoprolol tartrate and 2.5 of 
lisinopril. A few hours later she was slightly dizzy with blood 
pressure 89/53. She was encouraged to increase p.o. fluids and 
her dizziness resolved. She is now ambulating without any 
symptoms.
