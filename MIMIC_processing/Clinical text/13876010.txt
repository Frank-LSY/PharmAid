Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with no significant PMH or

attending the ___.  She has been having
problems with sleep (sleeping only ___ hours/night) for the last

getting out of bed in the morning when she finally fell asleep

She endorses over-eating.  In the past week, she moved in with

out
of bed.  

Recent stressors are numerous - she recently broke up with her
partner of ___ years that she describes as a formative 
relationship

moved out and got into a new place which is actually tilted and
she very uncomfortable.

very talented, left.  She now has more responsibilities and

inadequate and inferior to this person that left, and she feels
tremendous pressure to fill his role.  

Initially after the break up (which she initiated with her
partner as she originally felt smothered in the relationship),
___ describes herself as "happy".  She reconnected with many
people over the summer and describes herself as "the happiest
ever".  She denies symptoms of mania such as risk-taking
behavior, goal-directed activities, rapid or pressured speech,
grandiosity.  Everything was going well but in the past month or
so (in the context of the move, a new job, stress) the patient
has realized how lonely she is without her partner and wonders 
if
she'll ever find someone to spend her life with.  She describes
herself as never on her own as an adult before and she became so
overwhelmed with lack of sleep, feeling lonely, feeling down,
that she did not see a way out and became passively suicidal 7
days ago.  She describes the feeling as "I don't want to do this
anymore".  In the past two days she became actively suicidal,

Disorder with Depressed Mood/Anxiety.  Notably, Dr. ___ 
started her on citalopram 10 mg at their first appointment on

stomach upset so Dr. ___ her to go down to 5 mg.  
During admission, we discussed how GI symptoms are typically 
only a problem within the first few days of starting 
antidepressant SSRI's.  We emphasized the need for an SSRI to 
address depression and anxiety which ___ agreed to.  She was 
started on citalopram 5 mg at night (felt it made her drowsy)

continue to titrate citalopram with Dr. ___ we heavily 
emphasized the fact that she needs to wait at least four weeks 
for the antidepressant to really begin to take effect.  She is 
willing to give the medication time.  

To address insomnia, we ended up choosing Ativan 1 mg as 
Trazodone 50mg had not been working; vistaril was not fully 
successful either.  We have agreed to discharge her on 1mg for 
several nights and then have her taper down to 0.___.  The patient also began using coping skills (drawing, 
reading) and attending groups as she got more sleep.  She firmly 
believed that the root of her suicidality was the extreme lack 
of sleep.  

On discharge she is future-oriented, ready to go back to the

mother and has agreed to use coping skills and talk to someone 
should these thoughts return.

depression, high anxiety, recent transition to adulthood.

The patient is no longer having active SI, is future-oriented,
starting to utilize coping skills for anxiety, and would like a
