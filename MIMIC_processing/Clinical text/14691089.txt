Pertinent Results:
CT Head w/o Contrast ___ 1:19 AM
FINDINGS:    
There is no evidence of large territorial infarction, edema, or 
mass effect.  
Subtle hyperdensity is seen within several frontal lobe sulci 
(2:18, 2:17, 
2:20, 2:21). This may represent small subarachnoid blood. A 
calcified 
extra-axial lesion is seen in the left frontal lobe (02:22), 
measuring 
approximately 1.6 x 1.2 cm. The ventricles and sulci are normal 
in size and configuration.   
There is no evidence of fracture. There is a large right-sided 
periorbital 
hematoma The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.   
IMPRESSION:   
1. Subtle hyperdensity in several right-sided frontal sulci may 
represent 
small subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
2. Left frontal calcified extra-axial mass, possibly a 
meningioma. 
  
CT Head w/o Contrast ___ 09:00 AM
FINDINGS:  
The subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe 
is unchanged in size and distribution. There is no evidence of 
new hemorrhage. There is no evidence of infarction, edema, or 
mass. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and 
configuration. 
  
There is a right frontal subgaleal hematoma, unchanged from 
prior. There is no evidence of fracture. The calcified 
extra-axial lesion adjacent to the inner table of the left 
frontal calvarium is also unchanged. The visualized portion of 
the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear 
cavities are clear. The patient is status post bilateral 
cataract surgery. Otherwise, the visualized portion of the 
orbits are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:   
1. Stable right frontal lobe posttraumatic subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. 
2. No evidence of new hemorrhage. 
3. Stable right frontal subgaleal hematoma without evidence of 
underlying 
fracture. 
4. Stable calcified lesion adjacent to the inner table of the 
left frontal 
calvarium, possibly a meningioma.

struck her in the head and face multiple times with his fists.  
On arrival in the ED, the patient received platelets to reverse 
aspirin therapy.  She was loaded with 1g keppra and continued on 
keppra 500mg twice daily.  CT scan revealed subtle hyperdensity 
in several right-sided frontal sulci which may represent small 
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left frontal calcified extra-axial 
mass, possibly a meningioma. The patient remained neurologically 
and hemodynamically stable.  Repeat NCHCT 6 hours later was 
stable.  The patient was assessed by occupational therapy, who 
recommended home services.  The patient declined evaluation by 
physical therapy. The patient verbally consented to discussing 
her injury with her outpatient neurologist Dr. ___ at 
___ who will see her in follow-up within 1 week
