History of Present Illness:
___ is a  ___ year old with past psychiatric history of
ADHD, MDD and trichotillomania who presented to the ___ ED 
with
suicidal ideation and recent near suicide attempt.

The patient reports multiple psychosocial stressors over the 
past
six months (outlined below) with worsening depressive symptoms
and increasing social isolation. The ___ before presentation
(___) the patient had an appointment with her outpatient
PCP ___ but was unable to
make the appointment due to a snowstorm (despite her wishes to
make the appointment). The following day (___) the patient's
college friends attended an ___ without her and she felt
increasingly lonely. From 18:30 to 01:30 the following morning
she strongly considered drinking a bottle of bleach in an 
attempt
to kill herself. She describes a cycle in which she put the
bottle on a table and "stared" at it trying to decide if she
would kill herself, then putting the bottle away and pacing in
her dorm before repeating the cycle. At the time she viewed
suicide as a way of escaping her depressive symptoms. She 
reports
that she eventually decided not to attempt suicide because she
thought it would be "selfish" to do so and would make her 
parents
and friends depressed. When reflecting on this event she states
"I don't want to die. I just don't want to feel this way." She
reports that if she returns home today she is "not sure what
would happen" and does not feel that she would be safe if she
returned to her dorm.

The day prior to presentation (___) she had an appointment
with her PCP. In that appointment she reported
worsening depression but did not mention the events of ___.
She was prescribed an anti-depressant at that appointment. The
patient believes this medication is Citalopram and she took one
dose the evening before admission which made her "arms feel
light" and improved her anxiety somewhat. On the day of
presentation she had an initial appointment with her new 
therapist ___.
In that appointment the patient spoke about her near suicide
attempt on ___ and the therapist told the patient to come to
the ED for further care.

The patient reports that since she was ___ years old she pulled
hair out hair on her head in a ritual that "relieved tension."
She did not start any treatment at the time but reports her
parents "knew [she] was depressed" because of this behavior. By
the time she was in high school she realized she had been
depressed and anxious since at least ___ years old but was
unaware that these were unusual thoughts. In high school she
began to see a therapist which she thought was helpful but she
has not taken any anti-depressants until ___.

This past ___ the patient started a relationship with a
college ___ (studying in ___ with whom she had
previously been close. Both the patient and this man were on
school break and initially decided not to continue the
relationship past ___ break but both decided they wanted to
continue dating. On ___ Day the patient had dinner with
the man's family. The following day he broke up with her stating
that he is a senior in college and wants to be single. The
patient found this very distressing. The following week one of
her professors expressed concern that the patient was not
"putting her all" into her art and suggested the patient may be
better off in another field. She does not think the professor
meant to be malicious but was distraught nonetheless. The
following week she had finals then went on Winter break.

During break she made a "bucket list" of things she wanted to do
before committing suicide. Later on in break she had a panic
attack characterized by tachypnea, tachycardia, diaphoresis,
nausea, and chest pain which resulted in the patient passing out
for reportedly an hour. On reflecting she believes this may have
been a positive event in that it showed her parents that she has
" a problem." The parents have not been very supportive of her
psychiatric diagnoses stating that she should "get over" her
depression and that other people have "real problems." Since
returning to school from break she has isolated herself from
friends and family to an increasing degree leading up to the
aforementioned near suicide attempt.

The patient endorses symptoms of depression including depressed
mood, fatigue, loss of energy, anhedonia, low motivation, 
thoughts
of death/SI, insomnia, loss of appetite recently (until ___
after which time she has had elevated appetite), and poor
concentration.  The patient denies symptoms of mania including
impulsive behavior or decreased need for sleep (she has slept
less but has been negatively affected by this insomnia).  The
patient also denies psychotic symptoms such as auditory or 
visual
hallucinations, paranoia, or delusions.

actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon ongoing depression 
and anxiety and suicidal ideation.  Their static factors noted 
at that time included history of chronic mental illness, 
Caucasian race, young age, and single status. Their modifiable 
risk factors were addressed and included resolution of suicidal 
ideation, initiation of appropriate pharmacotherapy, and 
solidification and connection to outpatient providers and 
programs. Finally, the patient is being discharged with many 
protective risk factors,  which include help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, strong family support, reality 
testing ability, good coping skills, good problem-solving 
skills, positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient 
providers, lack of suicidal ideation, no history of substance 
use disorder, no history of abuse. Overall, based on the 
totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at 
an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our prognosis of this patient is very good given that she is 
currently at low-risk for self-harm, no longer requires 
inpatient hospitalization, and will do well on an outpatient 
basis with ongoing therapy, family support, and close 
psychiatric follow-up.
