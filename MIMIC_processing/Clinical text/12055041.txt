History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ y/o left handed F with a hx of HTN, HLD and
hx of  TIAs and prior strokes (most recently in ___ on
Aggrenox who presented with slurred speech and left hand 
numbness
that began at 0830 while the patient was driving to work this
morning. 

She first noticed her forearm had tingling/numbness extending to
her left hand followed by slurred speech. She was seeking out
loud to herself while driving and noted that her speech sounded
"garbled". When she arrived to work her co-worker noted that her
speech was improving. Her co-worker noted that she had a mild
left facial droop that was only present a few mins but did not
recur. The "garbled" speech lasted ~20mins initially.  On her 
way
to ___ the patient noted that she had intermittent slurred
speech. The left hand numbness resolved after 5 minutes and has
not recurred. She denies any difficulty producing or
understanding language rather her speech was just "messy". By 
the
time patient was evaluated in the CT scanner her dysarthria had
resolved but during our interview it returned for a few mins 
then
resolved. 

Patient did not experience any lightheadedness, headache, 
hearing
loss, visual field cuts, blurry vision, weakness or
numbness/tingling in other areas of her body.

Patient has a history of TIA and strokes with her most recent 
one
being one month ago characterized by slurred speech, but no left
hand numbness. Patient also notes two TIA episodes in ___ which
did include left hand numbness. She has been on Aggrenox since
her ___ episodes. For her stroke last month she was found to
have a small white matter infarct of the right posterior frontal
centrum semiovale with mild to moderate narrowing of the right
ICA terminus. She was taken off her aggrenox at this time and
discharged just on placid. After speaking to her PCP and Dr.
___ Neurologist, patient was instructed to restart her
aggrenox about two weeks ago. 

On neuro ROS, pertinent positives in HPI, the pt denies 
headache,
loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysphagia,
lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal
weakness. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies
difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history notable 
for hypertension hyperlipidemia type 1 diabetes and multiple 
TIAs who presented to the hospital with abrupt onset of slurred 
speech and left hand distal numbness concerning for a vascular 
event. She was brought to the hospital where she had a CTA which 
showed intracranial atherosclerosis, MRI showing a small right 
frontal infarct, which was presumed to be due to small vessel 
disease given her risk factors and the appearance and location 
of the lesion. Her Aggrenox was discontinued. She was loaded 
with Plavix in the ED, and maintained on dual antiplatelet 
therapy throughout her hospitalization with aspirin and Plavix. 
There was thought to be a component of flow dependence to her 
neurological exam, as she experienced transiently worsening of 
her speech with sitting up on presentation. She was kept with 
her head of bed flat for 24 hours, and then her activity was 
gradually liberalized without worsening of her speech. Her 
medication regimen was eventually transitioned on discharge to 
aspirin and cilostazol on day of discharge. Her hemoglobin a1c 
7.5, and LDL 68. She was discharged home in hemodynamically 
stable condition with appropriate follow up appointments 
scheduled. She was discharged home with a zio patch for long 
term cardiac rhythm monitoring. Telemetry failed to capture any 
arrhythmias throughout her hospitalization.

# Stroke (right pons) likely ___ small vessel disease
- Stop Aggrenox, start cilostazol 100 daily for 5 days then 
increase to cilostazol 100mg BID, start aspirin 81mg daily, per 
outpatient Neurologist's (Dr. ___ recommendation. 
- Continue atorvastatin 80
- Ziopatch prior to discharge to look for occult atrial 
fibrillation
- Neurology follow up with Dr. ___ ___

# IDDM, type I
- Patient's home insulin regimen via insulin pump was continued. 
___ was consulted for assistance with blood sugar control. 
- If in the event pt becomes unable to manage insulin pump, pump
malfunctions or she needs to be switched to SC insulin for any
other reason please utilize the following plan formulated by 
___:

-Lantus 24 u once daily (if pump is on, give lantus and wait 2
hrs before disconnecting)
-Humalog fixed dose 9 u at each meal (pt can carb count 1 u per
3.5 gCHO at breakfast, 1 u per 5 gCHO at lunch and dinner and
request up to 9 u Humalog fixed at each meal. She can however
request less based on her PO intake. **Confirm with pt BEFORE
giving fixed Humalog dose** 
-Humalog SS, starting with 1 u + 1 u per 40 mg/dL >160 mg/dL at
meals and >200 mg/dL at HS.

- follow up Zio results
- titrate up cilostazol from daily to BID on ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of speech difficulty and 
arm numbness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows:
STOP Aggrenox
START Aspirin 81mg by mouth daily
START Cilostazol 100mg by mouth daily until ___ then twice 
daily after that

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
