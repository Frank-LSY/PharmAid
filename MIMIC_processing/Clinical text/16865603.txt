few
T2 hyperintense cystic lesions are seen scattered

osseous lesion identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with hx of htn, choledocholithiasis, 
cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, CKD stage II-III, 
hyperbilirubinemia (predominantly indirect), H. pylori 
gastritis, admitted after ERCP for biliary obstruction ___ 
choledocholithiasis and five stones removed. Afterwards he was 
taken to the operating room and underwent a laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy. Please see operative report for details of this

upon completion. He was subsequently taken to the PACU for 
recovery.

He was transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically stable. 
His vital signs were routinely monitored and he remained 
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was initially given IV 
fluids postoperatively, which were discontinued when she was

tolerated without abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He was 
voiding adequate amounts of urine without difficulty. He was

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ and 
underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy after a procedure 
called an ERCP. During the ERCP you had five stones removed from 
your common bile duct.  You did very well after your procedure 
and had no pain or problem with eating.   Your liver function 
and bilirubin tests are also improving, and you should get them 
rechecked by Dr ___ in the next few weeks. You are recovering 
well and are now ready for discharge. Please follow the 
instructions below to continue your recovery:

You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.

to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.

throat during surgery.

away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
