Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ old man with a history of metastatic colon
cancer, here with nausea, vomiting and hiccups. These have now
resolved with Thorazine infusion in the ED. Exam is notable for
tachycardia and initially borderline SBPs (in the setting of
Thorazine infusion), felt better with Zofran ODT and was 
discharged home the next AM.
Nausea felt to be from chemotherapy. Responded to Zofran. 

Acute problems:

# Nausea, vomiting, hickups: Causes included delayed reaction to
chemo vs progression of primary disease vs infection (ranging
from gastroenteritis to liver abscess). 
Responded well to Zofran.
BP on the lower side (SBP ___, responded to fluids. Before DC 
SBP 110s/80s

# Transaminitis: Likely a result of liver mets though chemo
side-effect certainly also possible. RUQUS reassuring (though
would not expect to see any major abnormalities since LFTs do 
not
conform to an obstructive pattern).
Downtrending. Will need outpt LFTs to monitor trend.

# Insomnia: Ongoing issue
discontinued Trazodone since interaction with Zofran (Increases 
Qtc)

# Metastatic colon cancer:
- Chemo per primary oncologist (ongoing FOLFIRI-avastin vs
enrolment in a trial)

For hiccups, suggested using baclofen and wrote scripts. DC'd 
home in a stable condition.
