Abdominal CT scan ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Early edematous pancreas with adjacent fat stranding, 
concerning for mild acute pancreatitis. An right upper quadrant 
ultrasound is recommended to rule out gallstones. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S): A right upper quadrant ultrasound is 
recommended to rule out gallstones. 

RUQUS ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Cholelithiasis and gallbladder sludge without cholecystitis. 
2. Several small hyperechoic hepatic lesions likely representing 
benign 
hemangiomas. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Ms. ___ is a ___ yo female here with 
abdominal pain, found to have acute pancreatitis.  The etiology 
of the symptoms could be related to gallstone pancreatitis, or 
related to her supplement.  She is hemodynamically stable, but 
with significant metabolic derangements, with metabolic 
alkalosis and possible gap acidosis.  It is hard to parse out 
what of this is related to her supplements and what might be 
related to the pancreatitis.  With the finding of gallstones, 
she likely will require cholecystectomy, likely on this 
admission.  She also needs to stop the supplements.

The patient was managed on the medical team from ___ for 
management of her pancreatitis.  Her metabolic derangements 
resolved and subsequent to this, she was transferred to the 
acute care surgery service to undergo cholecystectomy. She was 
taken to the operating room and underwent a laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy on ___. Please see operative report for 
details of this procedure. She tolerated the procedure well and 
was extubated upon completion. She was subsequently taken to the 
PACU for recovery.

She was transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically 
stable. Her vital signs were routinely monitored and she 
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was initially 
given IV fluids postoperatively, which were discontinued when 
she was tolerating PO's. Her diet was advanced on the morning of 
___ to regular, which she tolerated without abdominal pain, 
nausea, or vomiting. She was voiding adequate amounts of urine 
without difficulty. She was encouraged to mobilize out of bed 
and ambulate as tolerated, which she was able to do 
independently. Her pain level was routinely assessed and well 
controlled at discharge with an oral regimen as needed.

On ___, she was discharged home with scheduled follow up in 
___ clinic in 2 weeks.
