Imaging: 
CT head w/o OSH: (my read) unremarkable

CTA head/neck from CHA: (my read) occlusion of the L vertebral 
artery at or near the origin with some retrograde filling in the 
V4 segment. Of note, there is significant calcification of the 
mid-cervical vertebral artery indicative of prior severe 
stenosis of this region. 

MRI/MRA ___: 1. Acute to subacute infarct in the left 
inferior cerebellar hemisphere in the ___ territory with 
occlusion of the left vertebral artery.  No priors are available 
for comparison. 
2. Remainder of the intracranial arterial vasculature is patent 
without significant stenosis, additional areas of occlusion, or 
aneurysm. 

Echo ___: No ASD, PFO or LV thrombus seen. Normal global and 
regional biventricular systolic function.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted with dizziness, found to have L 
vertebral artery occlusion and ___ infarct. His dizziness 
improved, and he was cleared by ___ to go home with outpt ___. 
Echo negative for embolic source. The L vertebral artery 
occlusion is possibly atherosclerotic in nature given 
significant calcification at one point in the mid-cervical 
vertebral artery indicating moderate to severe chronic stenosis. 
Other possibilities include cardioembolic. 
He was started on aspirin 81 and statin, and discharged with 
plan for outpatient ___ of Hearts monitoring. 

24 hour events prior to discharge: 
- Mr. ___ was about to leave on ___, when he had an 
episode of vasovagal presyncope in the setting of anxiety. 
Additionally, there was felt to be a possible contribution of 
orthostasis as he was orthostatic by HR but not BP criteria. He 
received IVF bolus and was encouraged to take PO fluids, which 
he did steadily overnight. He did not have a ride overnight ___ 
and left in the morning of ___. 

=====================================
Transitional Issues: 
[ ] PCP: consider starting an antihypertensive. SBP ranged 
120-140s during the admission. Aggressive BP management was not 
initiated in the acute setting after stroke given goal of 
permissive hypertension for the first days post-infarct.
