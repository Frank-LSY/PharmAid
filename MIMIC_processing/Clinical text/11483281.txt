Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital after 
being evaluated for dizziness and unsteadiness, with associated 
whole body tingling and shaking without loss of awareness or 
confusion, found to be hypertensive >200s. MRI revealed a small 
punctate acute ischemic infarct in the left extreme capsule. He 
had no deficits on initial or subsequent evaluations. His A1c 
was elevated to 9.3, LDL to 129, and he was hypertensive 
throughout his stay. We started him on 81mg of aspirin as well 
as atorvastatin 40mg. We also increased his home losartan. His 
CTA was unrevealing, and his stroke etiology was felt to be most 
likely from small vessel disease. However, a cardioembolic 
source could not be effectively ruled out, especially as he 
initially endorsed sensory symptoms ipsilateral to the infarct 
seen on MRI. Although we recommended that he stay to finish the 
work up especially for proximal sources of infarcts, he declined 
and requested to be discharged.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of sensory 
changes/disorientation resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, 
a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
UNCONTROLLED DIABETES
HIGH CHOLESTEROL  

We are changing your medications as follows:  
INCREASE losartan to 50mg daily
START atorvastatin 40mg daily
START aspirin 81mg daily

We recommended that you undergo complete workup and medical 
optimization prior to discharge; however, we understand personal 
issues do come up. On discharge, we recommend that you follow up 
with your primary care provider ___ ___ weeks. We also will 
set you up for follow up with the Stroke Department to further 
coordinate care. We will also arrange for you to have an 
outpatient transthoracic echocardiogram as well as a heart 
monitor. We recommend that you follow up with your primary care 
provider ___ better control of your 
blood sugars/diabetes.

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
