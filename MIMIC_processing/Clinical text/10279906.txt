IMAGING:

CXR
IMPRESSION:  
Blunted left costophrenic angle may be due to small pleural
effusion and atelectasis, but consolidation is not excluded in
the appropriate clinical setting.  If/when patient able,
dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further
evaluation.   
Trace right pleural effusion difficult to exclude.  Possible
minimal interstitial edema.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate dependent atelectasis in the bilateral lower lobes 
and small
dependent bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Mild pulmonary edema.
3. No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis.

CT C-SPINE
1. No acute fracture of the cervical spine.
2. Grade 1 retrolisthesis C3 over C4.  Grade 1 anterolisthesis 
C4 over C5, C5 over C6 and C6 over C7. This is likely 
degenerative in nature, although no prior currently available 
for comparison.  If clinical concern for ligamentous injury, MRI 
is more sensitive..
3. 2-3 mm right apical pulmonary nodule.
 For incidentally detected nodules smaller than 6mm in the 
setting of an
incomplete chest CT, no CT follow-up is recommended.
 
See the ___ ___ Guidelines for the Management 
of Pulmonary
Nodules Incidentally Detected on CT" for comments and reference:
___
4. Enlarged, heterogeneous, multinodular thyroid gland.
5. Very partially imaged upper lung apices demonstrate either 
mild pleural
thickening or trace pleural effusions.

CT HEAD
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Extensive periventricular subcortical white matter 
hypodensities, overall unchanged compared to prior, most likely 
related to small vessel ischemic changes.

___ VEIN STUDY
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins.
2. Small left ___ cyst.
3. Patient refused imaging of the right lower extremity.

TTE
 Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
global biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic and mitral 
regurgitation. Mild to moderate tricsupid regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary hypertension.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with PMHx HTN, depression, RBBB who 
presented from ___ with lethargy and confusion.

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:
# (Likely chronic) compensated hypercarbic respiratory failure:
# Acute metabolic alkalosis:
# Chronic diastolic CHF, ?acute on chronic:
TTE with normal biventricular function, and mild symmetric LVH. 
Legs still appear slightly edematous, but with significant skin 
wrinkling implying improvement from admission. Tmax 99.1 during 
admission which supports likely infectious process. Chest CT 
without consolidations/pneumonia. VBG with significant 
hypercarbia to 82 and stable on repeat, but relatively preserved 
pH of 7.33 and elevated bicarb. Unclear exactly why she is 
hypercapnic, but suspect given bicarb trend on labs has been 
going on for at least the past week iso her known URI. No known 
hx of COPD or asthma (patient is also a never smoker). Patient 
given duonebs q6 hours, which we recommend continuing upon 
discharge. Lasix discontinued after a couple of IV doses (of 
20mg each) given progressing bicarb elevation, and would 
recommend monitoring patient's weight closely and deciding on 
oral Lasix in future if has worsening edema or suddenly 
increasing weight. On discharge patient between room air and 2L 
nasal cannula O2 with sats in low ___.

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy:
Waxing and waning mental status. CT head negative. Geriatrics 
team evaluated patient, and trazodone held in setting of 
intermittent sedation. Large component of confusion likely 
secondary to metabolic changes as described above. Could 
consider outpatient MRI if persisting and within goals of care 
of patient/family. 

# Coag negative staph in blood culture:
Gram stain of aerobic bottle from blood culture on ___ w/ GPCs 
in pairs and clusters, with culture eventually growing coagulase 
negative staph. Was started on empiric IV vancomycin pending 
culture results. High likelihood that this is a contaminant 
given lack of fever/leukocytosis, no further positive cultures 
and particular organism, therefore vancomycin was discontinued 
once this resulted on ___.

# Goals of care: 
Patient has DNAR/DNI MOLST on file. However, there is some 
discrepancy between a MOLST that we have and another (possibly 
more current) MOLST that ___ has stating that she would 
or wouldn't want to be transferred to the hospital. (The one we 
have on file says she is ok to transfer). I clarified this point 
with her healthcare proxy ___, who reports that he did endorse 
her transfer to the hospital on this occasion. Would recommend 
ongoing discussions between PCP and HCP, and consideration of 
filling out an updated MOLST should preferences change.

# Depression/Anxiety:
Patient's nephew reports that she is extremely anxious. There 
was some discrepancy between med recs, but after reconciling 
further, to clarify, she is NOT on Seroquel. She is on trazodone 
and mirtazapine.

# Concern for aspiration: 
Did reasonably well with bedside speech/swallow evaluation here. 
Diet recommendation is regular solids and thin liquids. 
Recommend ongoing evaluation with speech/swallow at ___ if 
further concerns for aspiration.

# HTN:
Continued amlodipine 2.5.
