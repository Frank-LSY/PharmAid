Service: NEUROSURGERY

Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
cervical stenosis
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___: C3-C6 Laminectomies and Fusion
 
History of Present Illness:
___ female known cervical spondylosis and progressive 
disease.  Over the last year, she had a couple of falls. Most 
recent MRI shows multilevel
cervical spondylosis with myelopathy more impressive between
C3-C4 and C4-C5; It is less at C5-C6 and minimal at C6-C7. 
There is evidence of myelomalacia posterior at C3, which is not
around the area of the stenosis, but there is new evidence of
myelomalacia posterior to C4.  She has developed worsening neck 
and right arm pain and she has failed physical therapy as well 
as
medical management.  Every time she bends her head forward,
she gets extreme numbness and tingling.  She has to keep her 
head
straight.

Flexion and extension x-rays show borderline spondylolisthesis 
at C3-C4, but significant angulation at C4-C5 indicating 
instability at that level.  The patient will definitely benefit 
from posterior cervical laminectomies and fusion.
