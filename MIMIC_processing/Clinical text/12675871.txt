History of Present Illness:
___ woman with history of hypertension, obesity, and
hyperlipidemia who presented to ___ emergency department
after 2 hours of chest pain in the morning.  The pain was
described as pressure in her central chest radiating to the 
neck,
jaw, and bilateral shoulders.  She notes that the pain was not
positional or change with respiration.  This all occurred while
she was getting ready for work this morning.  She has never
experienced pain like this before, and has no history of
exertional chest pain.  She notes no past medical history of
blood clots, recent travel, immobility, or surgery.  She denies
experiencing associated nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, back 
pain,
fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain.

At ___ she was noted to have concerning changes on her EKG
and troponin to 0.02 with normal CK MB.  She was given 325 mg of
aspirin and transferred over to ___ for further evaluation.

In the ___ emergency 
department,
she was started on a heparin drip and her home medications were
restarted.  Her troponins were monitored, and peaked at 0.49 
from
0.38.  Her EKGs were monitored, demonstrating evolving T wave
inversions in lateral leads V1 through V6 as well as small ST
depressions in V4.  She was evaluated by ___'s cardiology and
plan for cardiac catheterization in the morning of ___.

In the ED initial vitals were:  
98.1F, 81, 138/79, 16, 95% RA 
 
EKG:  ___ NSR 76 NA QTc 159 TWI III, TWF in lateral leads

shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or bowel or bladder
incontinence.

CORONARY CATH ___
Coronary Anatomy
Right dominant
LM: No disease.
LAD: Serial 90% lesions in mid LAD.
LCx: Ostial OM1 80% stenosis.
RCA: Proximal 30% stenosis.

Interventional Details
After discussion with Dr. ___ proceeded with PCI of the 
LAD. The plan was to medical manage the OM lesion. EBU3.5 guide 
engaged the LM. The LAD was wired with a Runthrough wire. 
Angioplasty with a 2.0 balloon followed by placement of a 2.5 x 
30 mm Onyx DES. Post-dilated with a 2.75 NC balloon throughout.
TIMI III flow, 0% residual.

Impressions:
Serial 90% mid LAD lesions, s/p placement of a single 2.5 x 30 
DES, post-dilated to 2.75.
OM1 80% lesion, not stented.

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic 
function (biplane LVEF = 63 %). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.

optimized, will need outpatient follow up for exercise MIBI to 
determine if wall motion abnormalities are being caused by OM1 
lesion. Started on aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg 
daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily, 
and ticagrelor on discharge.
