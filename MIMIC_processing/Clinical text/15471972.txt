Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Chest discomfort, acid reflux
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary angiography ___:

Â• No epicardial major vessel coronary artery disease.The distal 
LPL ___ is small caliber and appears more narrow in the mid 
segment before returning to larger caliber. This could represent 
a spontaneous dissection.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ female with ___ Hashimoto thyroiditis, 
IBS who initially was referred to ___ with chest pain. She 
started having chest pain on ___ at approximately 9 ___ which

at 11 ___. She woke her husband who checked her HR and noticed 
she had bradycardia in the ___. Yesterday morning, patient 
presented to Urgent Care and was found to have troponin of 0.16 
and EKG showed T wave flattening in leads III and aVF. 

Patient was referred to ___ and started on heparin gtt, ASA 81

RELEVANT STUDIES
==========================
___ CXR PA/LATERAL: No acute intrathoracic cardiopulmonary 
process.

___ CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY:
The left main, left anterior descending, circumflex and right 
coronary artery have no obstructive disease. There is a small 
distal LPL branch that is diffusely narrowed in the mid segment.

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM:

regional/global systolic function. No valvular pathology or 
pathologic flow identified. Normal estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure. Minimally dilated ascending aorta. No prior

hours with no residual symptoms, lab abnormalities, or telemetry 
abnormalities.

distal LPL narrowing concerning for spontaneous dissection 
PUMP: No previous TTE

=============== 
ACTIVE ISSUES: 
=============== 
# NSTEMI
# Spontaneous coronary artery dissection
Noted to have NSTEMI in urgent care after isolated episode of 
chest discomfort. Troponins, CK-MB have been trended to peak and 
patient remains chest pain free. Coronary angiography did not 
show significant major vessel CAD but did show distal LPL 
narrowing which likely represented spontaneous coronary artery 
dissection. Followup echocardiogram demonstrating no wall motion 
abnormalities or valvular abnormalities
- To be discharged on ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin 20mg qdaily, and 
metoprolol XR 50 mg qdaily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

Why was I here?
- You were having chest discomfort and reflux symptoms which 
brought you to urgent care. Due to an elevated troponin which 
showed a minor heart attack, you were transferred to our cardiac 
direct access unit (___). 

What was done for me while I was here?
- You had a cardiac catheterization which looked at your heart 
blood vessels (coronary arteries). Your cath showed that one of 
the coronary arteries in your heart was most likely dissected, 
or torn. This is known as spontaneous coronary artery dissection 
(SCAD)
- You were treated medically (aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, 
atorvastatin). 

What should I do when I go home?
- You should take all of your medications as prescribed. 
- You should attend all of your follow-up appointments. 
- Please make note of the symptoms you had experienced that 
brought you to urgent care, as if the problem were to recur, it 
would likely feel the same. 

We wish you the best for your future health. 

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team
