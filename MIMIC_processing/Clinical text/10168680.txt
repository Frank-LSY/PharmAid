BRIEF SUMMARY 

___ with history of HTN, AVM s/p aneurysm coil surgery in ___ 
with chronic post op headaches who presents with fevers, 
intermittent chest pain, and headaches.  On exam he had fever 
and tachycardia.  His labs were notable for transaminitis, 
elevated INR, and normocytic anemia.  An LP was unremarkable, CT 
head unchanged, CTA head showing 5.0 cm dilated proximal aorta, 
ECHO with mild global hypokinesis and normal valves.  Patient 
treated empirically for tick-borne illness while serologies 
pending.  He will have follow up imaging for dilated aortic root 
in 6 months. 

PROBLEM BASED ASSESSMENT/PLAN 

#Fever: Pt intermittently febrile over ___ days prior to 
presentation. Given other systemic symptoms including headaches, 
chest pain, and transaminitis and elevated INR - an infectious 
cause was sought.  An extensive workup was negative, with some 
results pending at discharge.  CT head and LP unremarkable.  
Liver function studies downtrending at the time of discharge. ID 
was consulted, recommended treating empirically for tick-borne 
illness as serologies pending.  Quantiferon positive and per ID 
follow-up consistent with latent TB given ___ active pulmonary 
symptoms and low suspicion for extra-pulmonary TB.  Chest pain 
was ruled out for ischemic causes. Autoimmune hepatitis, iron 
overload also ruled out. At the time of discharge patient was 
much improved from a symptom standpoint, back to his baseline 
state of health. 
- Doxycycline 100 mg BID ___ - ___
- Follow up with ID as outpatient for latent TB

# Dilated Aorta: CTA chest notable for dilated aortic root to 5 
cm. Cardiac surgery did not think this needed emergent surgery. 
Discussed findings with radiology who did not think there was 
evidence of inflammation with the dilatation.  ECHO showed 
tri-leaflet aortic valve. RPR within normal limits.  Most likely 
the patient had a dilated aortic related to vascular disease 
(i.e. known HTN), and was an incidental finding on imaging. 
However, pattern of dilation on ECHO (aortic root as opposed to 
supravalvular) is more commonly seen with aortitis or connective 
tissue disease versus HTN (more often supravalvular). 
- f/u ECHO in 6 months  

#Anemia: Mild normocytic anemia on labs stable during 
hospitalization.  Team considered hemolytic process given 
elevated LDH and transient indirect hyperbilirubinemia, but 
haptoglobin within normal limits (may be falsely elevated given 
acute phase).  

#HTN: Stable during hospitalization, given patient's long 
history of hypertension and somewhat young  age,  we considered 
secondary causes.  Renal vasculature was within normal limits on 
ultraound.  History suggesting sleep apnea as a possible 
contributing factor, supported by borderline pulmonary HTN on 
TTE. 
- Continue home lisinopril
- Transitional issue for sleep study 

#Headaches: Patient has long history of headaches after his 
craniotomy. Patient's pharmacologic management of headaches 
still requires clarification, as he presented numerous home 
medications (amitryptyline, sumatriptan, topiramate, aspirin) 
that he does not appear to be taking correctly (i.e. abortive 
vs. preventative use)  
- Continued home fluoxetine
- Transitional issue to clarify headache regimen 

# Insomnia:
- Continued home zolpidem

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having fevers 
and chest pain. Our team was most concerned about an infection 
explaining your symptoms.

We ordered multiple tests to determine a cause of your 
infection. These tests were all negative, and some still 
pending. We started an antibiotic called Doxycycline incase any 
of the remaining tests come back positive for infection. You 
improved on this antibiotic which you should continue to take as 
prescribed until ___. 

We also detected that you have an inactive form of tuberculosis 
("latent TB") which needs to be treated with an extended course 
of different antibiotics to prevent an active infection . Please 
follow up with the infectious disease doctors for further 
___ of this issue.

In your work up for chest pain, a scan of your chest showed that 
your aorta (the blood vessel coming off your heart) was slightly 
enlarged.  We are unsure if this is related to your recent 
illness or has been like this for quite some time. An ultrasound 
of your heart showed normal valves but a decreased pumping 
capacity of your heart.  You will need repeat imaging of your 
heart in 6 months and your primary care doctor can decide if you 
need to see a cardiologist.  

It was a pleasure taking care of you, we wish you the best,  

-Your ___ Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
