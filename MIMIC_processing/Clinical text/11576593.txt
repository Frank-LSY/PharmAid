Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were admitted to ___ with 
severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain and an elevated white 
blood count. You underwent several imaging studies which did not 
identify your appendix. The most recent CT scan demonstrated an 
infarction of your omentum (fat overlying the intestines). These 
infarctions can be extremely painful, but do not require any 
treatment. In addition, your CT scan showed bilateral pelvic 
lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph nodes) which will need 
to be worked up further to rule out another cause, such as 
infection or malignancy. Please follow-up with the Thoracic 
Surgeon, Dr. ___ at the appointment listed below to 
discuss the findings on your prior chest CT scan. Please see 
your PCP to discuss these findings and determine which, if any, 
additional lab tests they would like to perform. You are 
recovering well and are now ready for discharge. 

Warm regards, 

Your ___ Surgery Team
