Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ female who was seen through the Emergency 
Department in the setting of a tight stenosis in the carotid 
based on a CTA. This did appear focal
and quite tight with severe stenosis. She had been having 
symptoms of lightheadedness that have been progressing over the 
past few weeks; however, this did not seem related to her 
carotid. She was not on a statin or aspirin and was placed on it 
at that time and scheduled for a carotid endarterectomy.

Patient underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on ___ with 
Dr. ___ without complication.  For full details of the 
surgical procedure please see the dictated operative report.

surgery floor where she remained for the rest of her 
hospitalization.  Her diet was advanced and she was able 
tolerate a house diet. She was able to void on her own QS. 

She was monitored overnight for changes in blood pressure and 
found to be hypotensive. Although she reported chronic low blood 
pressures prior to admission her postoperative BPs of 
___ did require IV phenylephrine to maintain. She 
was evaluated by cardiology and started on PO midodrine with 
good effect.  She underwent an echo which was normal. Her 
cortisol was within  normal limits and a UA done on POD1 was 
negative.  Her TSH was found to be slightly elevated and T4 
within normal limits and she should follow up with her PCP for 
any further testing.  She is also instructed to follow up with 
PCP within one weak to start the process of weaning off of her 
midodrine.  She start to cut down the frequency of midodrine 
from 3 x/day to twice or once a day and then stop.

Patient will require follow up with a carotid duplex within 1 
month of discharge. She should continue to stay on ASA and 
atorvastatin lifelong.

first postoperative week.  She is discharged home in an improved 
and stable condition.
