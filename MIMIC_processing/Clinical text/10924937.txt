Chief Complaint:
"I've just had a bad few weeks."

Patient was admitted for passive suicidal ideation and 
disorganized behavior.  
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman currently attending
___ with a past history of depression and
anxiety who presents to the ED with her parents with concern for
worsening depression and suicidal ideation as well as possibly
delusional thoughts.  The patient reports that she has felt very
depressed intermittently for the last few years, but has been
worse the last two weeks and that her parents have been getting
worried about her.  She notes that about two weeks ago she went
days without sleep when she found out that significant issues
with her boyfriend ___ cheating allegations, emotional and
physical abuse, and threatening her). She said that he was 
making
accusations that she was cheating on him too, which she denies,
but this has caused some stress. During that time she went about
five days without sleep and has continued to sleep only
intermittently.

She said that she has been having "irrational thoughts, angry,
sad, depressed, everything."  She said that she has been having
random thoughts that pop into her mind that don't make sense. 
She says that she is paranoid and she feels that people are
watching her.  She knows that no one is actually watching her,
but that she has these feelings. She notes accusing her family 
of
doing things that "don't make sense." She adds that she doesn't
have any AH/VH. 

She notes that she hasn't been sleeping much and instead stays 
up
all night tweeting about random things from her past. She said
that people have texted her about the tweets to make sure that
she is okay, but she says that the tweets are just about "bad
things that happened before. They're usually sorry I went 
through
the things." She describes this as unusual. She denies riskier
behaviors. Reports some increased distractibility but unable to
describe what is going on.

She says that she has had intermittent thoughts of passive
suicide. She says that they are relatively constant during the
day.  She says that she has never had a plan. She said that she
has never attempted suicide before, but that when she had
thyrotoxicosis as a freshman in high school, she had severe
suicidal ideation. She said that she never attempted suicide. 
She
says that she feels somewhat similar as when she had the
thyrotoxicosis.  She says that she hasn't eaten in several days
because of a decreased appetite and lost 10 pounds. She reports
frequent palpitations, poor tolerance of hot and cold.

COLLATERAL:
___ (___)
The note that the patient started to have "intense anxiety" 
after
breaking up with her boyfriend.  She had called them and said
that she didn't feel well and was having difficulty managing, so
they had her come back from ___ a few days before her
___ break.  Since that time, they have noted some more 
unusual
behaviors and has been "delusional."  They note that she will
often have brief periods where she is "manic and argumentative,"
but then she switches quickly to being quiet, having difficulty
focusing and then pacing around the house.

They also note that the patient has been sleeping during this
time. They confirm that the patient was awake for several days
after the break-up and that her sleep has not really improved
since then.  Most worrisome, they say that the patient has been
saying very unusual things.  For instance, she will often become
very concerned about something and end up texting the family 
with
several texts in rapid succession. The subjects of these often
are often paranoid in nature. One notable worry occurred in the
middle of the night when the patient started to text about how
___ was going to blow up a school." The patient
reported some insight later on about how her worries were often
unfounded, but still adds, "In the moment, I really feel like
these things are real."  The family says that often her texts
don't make sense.

They recently got a call from the patient's former high school
because someone had been reporting that the patient has been
sending out over 1000 tweets a night with things that others 
have
found very concerning, including some vaguely suicidal thoughts.

On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout her admission.  They were also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Brief psychotic disorder 
Patient was admitted with paranoid thoughts and disordered 
thinking.  She was texting friends and family with concerns that 
___ was going to bomb a school and staying up for several 
nights at a time as well as sending 1000+ tweets in a night.  
Per history from patient's family, she has had at least two 
episodes like the present one before, one of which was 
attributed to thyroiditis.  She did endorse marijuana use prior 
to admission.  However, she has also been under considerable 
stress recently due to breaking up with her boyfriend who 
continued to try to contact her after they broke up and threated 
to hurt or kill himself in the context of the breakup.  Her 
presentation is concerning for an underlying psychotic disorder, 
but given recent substance use, this may also be a substance 
induced psychosis.  Patient was advised to avoid marijuana.  
Patient's psychosis may also be related to a mood disorder such 
as bipolar or depression with psychotic features.  She was 
started on Abilify 2.5 mg daily which she found helpful.  Her 
thought process became clearer and she became focused on being 
discharged and returning to school as soon as possible.  Would 
recommend close follow up with an outpatient psychiatrist to 
possibly increase the Abilify and to monitor for psychosis as 
this could be the start of a primary psychotic disorder.         
 

#) Depression
On admission, the patient endorsed depressed mood, decreased 
appetite, poor sleep, anhedonia, guilt and passive suicidal 
thoughts without a plan.  She was trialed on Cymbolta but it 
made her feel more anxious and agitated so it was discontinued.  
Patient's mood improved as she became less psychotic and took 
Abilify.      

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Marijuana use: Patient endorsed some marijuana use recently.  
Given her psychosis, she was advised to avoid marijuana as it 
may worsen her psychosis.  

4. MEDICAL
#) History of thyroiditis: Patient's TSH on admission was 2.0 
and she denied symptoms of thyroiditis.  

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patients primary team met with them daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Team met with patient and her mother to discuss treatment and 
follow up.  Patient's family felt she was much improved with 
Abilify and felt that it would be best to have her come home for 
a few days and then return to school with her mother 
accompanying her on the flight and staying for a few days so she 
could settle back into school.    

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Abilify 2.5 mg qAM
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Patient will follow up with her 
___ mental health service and they will coordinate a 
psychiatrist to follow her 

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon her disorganized 
and paranoid thoughts as well as passive SI.  Their static 
factors noted at that time include history of substance abuse 
(marijuana), age and marital status (recent breakup with 
boyfriend).   The modifiable risk factors included psychosis, 
disorganized behavior, no medications, lack of engagement with 
outpatient treatment, insomnia and active substance 
abuse/intoxication.  These factors were addressed by starting 
Abilify, coordinating outpatient providers for her and substance 
abuse counseling.  Finally, the patient is being discharged with 
many protective factors including help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, 
reality testing ability, lack of suicidal ideation, no history 
of abuse, and strong social supports.  Overall, based on the 
totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at 
an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is good given her response to 
treatment, strong family support and wiliness to engage in 
treatment.
