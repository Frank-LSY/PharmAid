Pertinent Results:

ADMISSION LABS:

___ notable for leukopenia to 3.7 and hypokalemia to 
3.4

================
IMAGING/STUDIES:
================

___ CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST
I do not see the appendix. Oral and IV contrast would be of 
assistance correlating with clinical and laboratory findings. 
Free fluid in the pelvis with question small ovarian cyst on the 
right. Slight high density in the medullary of both kidneys 
raising the question of early sponge kidneys.

___ US PELVIS
Free fluid in the cul-de-sac. No ovarian torsion are dominant 
cyst seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with history of Ehlers Danlos 
Syndrome, anxiety, prior kidney stone, POTS, question of mast 
cell activation syndrome, and chronic symptoms that she 
attributes to "chronic lyme and babesiosis", admitted ___
with several days of nausea, vomiting and PO intolerance, 
treated supportively, subsequently able to tolerate diet, able 
to be discharged home 

====================
ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================

# Acute on chronic nausea/epigastric pain
Patient followed by GI at ___ for chronic nausea of unclear 
etiology, who presented with several days of worsening nausea, 
vomiting and inability to tolerate PO intake.  Labs otherwise 
without notable findings. CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast did 
not highlight any acute intra-abdominal pathology, although 
could not visualize the appendix. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated 
free-fluid in the pelvis but was otherwise unremarkable. She was 
treated conservatively with NPO, IV fluids and prn symptom 
control, with rapid improvement in symptoms.  On morning 
following her admission, she denied any pain or nausea, and felt 
hungry.  Given rapid improvement in symptoms, suspect her 
symptoms were likely the result of an acute viral 
gastroenteritis with subsequent residual functional pain.  Prior 
to discharge patient tolerated PO intake without issue.  

# Leukopenia
Noted to have WBC 2.7.  In setting of above suspected viral 
illness, lab abnormality thought to be secondary to recent viral 
illness.  Recommended repeat CBC in one week to ensure 
normalization of CBC.  

# Hypokalemia
Potassium 3.4 in ___, likely in the setting of vomiting 
and diarrhea prior to admission. Resolved as of AM ___. 
Recommend repeat Chem-10 one week following discharge to ensure 
stability.  

# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome
Per ___ GI note (___), hypermobile EDS and POTS syndrome 
are associated with mast Cell syndrome but her symptoms have not 
been classic due to lack of certain systems such as skin 
manifestations or triggering by strong smells. Continued home 
Cromolyn 200mg QIDACHS. 

# POTS
Followed by Cardiology at ___. Per notes, encouraged to increase 
salt intake to at least ___ and wear compression 
stockings.

# ___ Syndrome, Hypermobile Type
Per ___ records, awaiting genetic testing, followed by Dr. 
___. Presumably hypermobility type without vascular 
involvement. 

# Microscopic hematuria
Noted to have ___ RBCs on UA without signs of infection.  Would 
consider repeat UA at outpatient follow-up to ensure resolution, 
and if persists, consider additional workup 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

[] HYPOKALEMIA: Recommend repeat Chem-10 in one week
[] LEUKOPENIA: Recommend repeat Chem-10 in one week 
[] Microscopic hematuria: Recommend repeat UA at follow-up visit 

[] Chronic nausea - patient and mother report that patient's 
chronic symptom burden relates to a  "chronic tick-borne 
illness", and they note seeking care internationally and using 
"natural therapy"; given lack of evidence-based literature to 
support the existence of this diagnosis, and the potential risks 
of unapproved treatments or of missing an alternate etiology for 
her symptoms, would consider workup for alternate causes for 
this chronic symptom burden
