Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with abdominal.  His 
temperature spiked to 102.4 in the Emergency Department and had 
a white blood cell count of 15.1. He had a CT scan showing acute 
appendicitis without perforation fecalith or abscess.  He 
elected a trial of IV antibiotics.  Unfortunately, his abdominal 
exam worsened
significantly within hours of starting antibiotics and he was 
taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy 
where he was found to have perforated appendicitis.  This 
procedure went well (reader, please refer to operative note for 
further details).  He was hypotensive with SBP in the ___ in the 
PACU and he received a 500 cc LR bolus, SBP increased to the 
___. After remaining hemodynamically stable in the PACU, the 
patient was transferred to the surgical floor on IV fluids, and 
acetaminophen and oxycodone for pain control.  The patient was 
hemodynamically stable.

When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain 
medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively 
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. 
The patient voided without problem. During this hospitalization, 
the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with 
respiratory toilet and actively participated in the plan of 
care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne 
boots were used during this stay.  He was prescribed a course of 
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole given his perforated 
appendicitis.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services.

instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with acute inflammation of 
your appendix.  You were initially given a trial of 
non-operative management and received intravenous antibiotics, 
however your abdominal pain worsened and you were therefore 
brought to the operating room and had your appendix removed 
laparoscopically.  Your appendix was found to be acutely 
inflamed and perforated.  The surgery went well and you received 
antibiotics post-operatively.  You are now doing well and are 
tolerating a regular diet.  You are ready to be discharged home 
to continue your recovery.  Please follow the discharge 
instructions below:

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o You have a topical glue, called Dermabond, covering your 
incisions.  This glue will fall off on its own over the next 
couple of weeks. 
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
