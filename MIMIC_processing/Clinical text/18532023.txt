Admission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___
 
Date of Birth:  ___             Sex:   M
 
Service: NEUROSURGERY
 
Allergies: 
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Upper extremity weakness.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ Spinal AVM embolization.
___ T3 Laminectomy and Angiogram.

 
History of Present Illness:
___ gentleman who fell in ___ on the ice and hit 
his head and neck.  He did not seek attention at that time, but 
noticed over the ensuing weeks, weakness of his triceps.  He is 
fairly active and works out on a regular basis.  He also 
developed some numbness in this distribution.  He was evaluated 
with MRI and then CT, CTA and EMG studies.  EMG studies 
demonstrate radiculopathy at C7 and C4. His MRI of the cervical 
canal demonstrates a number of serpiginous vessels, centered 
mostly around C6 and C7 which appear consistent with a spinal 
cord AVM.  It is unclear to me at this point whether these are 
venous structures in relation to a type 1 AVM or on the back 
wall of the pia itself of the spinal cord.  There is no cord 
edema. The risks and benefits of surgical intervention and 
embolization were discussed.

failed due to difficult access. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Spinal AVM:
Patient was taken to the angio suite on the day of admission on 
___ for an embolization of his cervical AVM. During the case, 
his AVM was visualized but the team was unable to pass the 
microcatheter into the lesion. He was transported to the neuro 
step down unit post procedurally with alternate planning for 
open surgery the following day. The patient was taken to the 
operating room on ___ and underwent a L3 laminectomy followed 
by a diagnostic angiogram for confirmation. On ___, the 
patient remained neurologically stable. He was voiding, 
tolerating a diet and ambulating independently. His respiratory 
rate was tachypnic to the low ___ into the morning. This was
