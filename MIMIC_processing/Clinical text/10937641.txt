History of Present Illness:
This patient is a ___ yo female with no known past psychiatric 
history who presented to the ED s/p suicide attempt in which she 
cut both her wrists with scissors at her aunts home, and then 
attempted to drink bleach before her family intervened and 
stopped her.  Per family, the acute stressor may have been that 
her family and her had planned to go to the hospital the 
following day to seek medical advice regarding her change in 
thought process and behavior over the past year. Patient 
describes low self esteem and poor body image since high school, 
has no friends other than first relatives, and spends her days 
at home (has not had full time job since ___. Over the past 
year, patient has noticed that people comment on her body image 
and say she is a man whenever she is out in public (of note, she 
has had 2 cosmetic surgeries on her nose and jaw and still feels 
unsatisfied with the results). This has caused her to isolate 
further. She then reports that more recently, her upstairs 
neighbor has starting posting information online and playing it 
through the radio which states that she is a transvestite. She 
also believes that this woman has placed a video camera in her 
home to monitor the patient. Patient reports poor sleep and poor 
appetite over this past month in addition to this depressed mood 
and isolation. She says that spending her days in isolation, 
unable to leave the house because everyone thinks that she is a 
transvestite is a "bleak existance" and that she wants help so 
that she can be less sensitive to their comments. She continues 
to endorse depressed mood on admission, but denies current 
thoughts of suicide, self harm, or harm towards others.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE TEMPLATE

1.Legal: ___
2.Medical: 
-Patient had elevated prolactin at 150. This was after recieving 
several doses of risperdal. As antipsychotics can increase the 
level of prolactin within a few hours of admission, this was not 
worked up further. This should be followed up by pt's outpatient 
PCP. 
-As patient had reduced food intake prior to and during 
hospitalization, a nutrition consult was obtained. It was 
recomended that patient consume one Ensure supplement shake with 
each meal, which patient did. Daily Chem 10 was obtained for the 
first 4 days of hospitalization and again on ___ to ensure 
that there were no electrolyte abnormalities, which there were 
not. B12 and folate levels were ordered and were normal. Weight 
was obtained on admission (108 lbs) and on ___ (110 lbs) to

encouraged on discharge to continue eating three meals per day, 
with protein in each meal, and to drink 1 Ensure with each meal.

first several days of admission. EKG on admission was normal. 
The tachycardia improved and patient's heart rate was 
consistently high ___, low 100s for several days before

outpatient work up.  
Patient did not have a PCP on admission. She not recieved 
preventative care since ___. She has been set up with a PCP on

addressed. 

3.Psychiatric

Extensive time was spent discussing the patients diagnosis and 
psychopharmacology issues.

Risperdal was started to treat pscyhosis. This medication was 
well-tolerated, and patient's paranoia and delusional ideas of 
reference largely resolved on a 4 mg daily dose. When she was 
admitted, she was endorsing ideas of reference and generalized 
paranoia, including paranoia that staff and patients on the unit 
were saying she was a man. By discharge, patient denied these 
thoughts, felt that people on the unit were friendly, and felt 
that her neighbor was no longer sending messages about her via 
various media outlets. She was also perseverative on her facial 
hair and jaw structure on admission. By discharge ,these issues 
were not brought up by her at all in conversation, and she was 
able to attend coping skills group.

She was also started on citalopram 40 mg daily for depression. 
This medication was also well-tolerated. On presentation after 
ED presentation s/p SA, patient was denying suicidality but 
continued to endorse depression, hopelessness, decreased 
concentration, and anergia. By discharge, she reported being 
hopeful about the future, was able to concentrate and read books 
she enjoyed, and reported feeling more energetic. On the day of 
discharge, she denied any thoughts of suicidality, denied a 
suicide plan, and denied desire to commit suicide. She cited the 
desire to never put her mother through that emotional pain as 
her protective factor. She also said that if she ever felt as 
bad as she did when she cut her wrists, she would now know that 
she could come to the emergency department or talk to family or 
outpatient treaters. 

She was initially placed on lorazepam 1 mg PO TID PRN 
anxiety/insomnia, however, she was noted to be sedated on this 
medication, so it was reduced to 1 mg PO QHS standing. 
Eventually, this was discontinued and replaced by remeron 30 mg 
PO QHS, to target patient's insomnia, decreased appetite, and 
depression. She tolerated this medication well and slept well at 
night. Her appetite remained low, as she drank ensures three 
times daily but ate minimal solid food. She did not lose weight 
during admission. Her weight should be monitored by her 
outpatient PCP. 

Collateral Information: Spoke with pt's mother at length, and 
had family meetings with patient's mother as well as aunt and 
uncle. 

At time of discharge, pt will be attending a partial hospital 
and this partial hospital will be setting her up with an 
outpatient psychiatrist. The discharge summary including 
hospital course and discharge disposition will be faxed to this 
partial hospital. 

4.Substance Abuse: No acute or chronic issues

5.Social/Milieu:

Pt  was encouraged to participate in units 
groups/milieu/therapy opportunities.  
Usage of coping skills and mindfulness/relaxation methods were 
encouraged.
Therapy addressed family/social/work/housing issues.  Patient 
initially participated in groups, however, she began isolated 
approxmiately 4 days into her hospitalization. Extra 
encouragement to participate and potential benefits to group 
participation including improved coping skills and mindfulness 
were given to patient. She began attending groups again on 
___ and continued to express that these were helpful in 
teaching coping skills.
Patient and family were involved in family meeting focused on 
psychoeducation and discharge planning.

6.Risk Assessment: 
This patient has some chronic risk of self harm given recent 
impulsive suicide attempt, few emotional supports, and no 
established pattern of help seeking (given the fact that this 
was first episode of self harm). Her recent, and only, suicide 
attempt, occured in the context of severe untreated depression 
and psychosis. Patient is no longer psychotic, has improved 
mood, and has many protective factors against repeat self harm 
such as supportive family, late onset of psychosis, no substance 
use, only one suicide attempt, mediation compliance, and 
establishment of outpatient treaters. She is currently in good 
behavioral control, denies any thoughts of self harm, and is 
future oriented. Therefore, she is not at any significant 
elevated acute risk at this time to warrant inpatient 
hospitalization.
