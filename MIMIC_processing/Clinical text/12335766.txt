History of Present Illness:

Per Dr. ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry Consult
note:
"History obtained with
collateral from girlfriend of ___ years, ___ (___).
Patient has had depressive episodes for many years, but first 
saw
a provider and began medication 6 months ago, taking Trintellix. 

Last month patient stopped taking medication and started using
marijuana in attempt to treat his depression.  Over several days
patient developed rapid speech, loosening of associations,
decreased need for sleep, and increased goal-directed activity. 
Patient was hospitalized at ___ on ___ for 1
day.  Zyprexa was started with good effect.  Several days after
discharge, patient stopped Zyprexa and resumed marijuana use.  

Over the past several weeks, patient has fluctuated between high
and low mood, with decreased need for sleep, rapid speech,
increased activity, and worsening paranoia.  This afternoon
girlfriend reports patient was swinging golf club around garage,
stating he did not know whether he could trust family and
girlfriend, then drove off and was unreachable for several 
hours.

On interview patient is smiling, intrusive, expansive.  When
asked how he is feeling, patient flexes arms and says
"fantastic".  Patient also appears guarded, stating he does not
wish to talk further stating "you haven't done anything to earn
my trust."  Patient denies SI, HI, AVH.  However, given recent
marijuana use, would like to reevaluate in the morning."

In the ED, the patient received olanzapine 5mg po @ 01:30
___, lorazepam 1mg po @ ___ 2:40, and olanzapine 5mg po 
@
10:01 ___. Patient maintained good behavioral control and 
did
not require physical/chemical restraints.

On interview today, patient shared that when he was driving in
his car, he felt that he could not control the radio channels 
and
that he felt he was receive messages directed at him to go to
___ or ___, and that he should start getting involved 
in
trying to get ___ to ___. He became
so impassioned that he pulled over, got out of his car, and 
began
to have conversations with other people, which he acknowledges
may have become screaming/yelling. Was in the middle of the road
in ___ and he shares that there may have been concerns
about him being in traffic, although he states that at this time
there were no cars. Endorses having used 3 vapes of cannabis oil
before this event, as well as 2 drinks of alcohol earlier in the
day. 

Shares that his current main psychosocial stressor has been his
unemployment status as he was laid off twice in the last 6
months. Having to live with his parents and not feeling that he
can provide for his girlfriend as he should, especially given 
his
age, has been making him feel guilty. But states that he tries 
to
remain optimistic and knows "I just need to ride it out",
"everyone has ups and downs". Currently states mood as "stable",
denying SI, states "I feel like protecting others and myself",
and when asked what he would like help with on Deac4, shares 
that
he wants to "take a lot of tests and challenge myself so that I
can grow as a person". When asked what he means by tests, shares
that he wants to improve his reading and math skills, and that 
if
he were to be given a test he would do his best "and that's all
that matters, you just give it your all".  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
DEPRESSION
Stress/anxiety causing some depressed mood, but has been
maintaining a positive attitude. States he keeps fighting for 
his
personal happiness. Reports getting 6 to 8 hours of sleep a
night, and that he feels "a ton of energy". Endorses poor
concentration and difficulty focusing, but states this has been
an issue for him his whole life. Shares he feels guilt due to 
his
___ upbringing and does not want to disappoint others 
around
him, but denies hopelessness stating that he is "very hopeful"
about the future.

PSYCHOSIS
Per HPI. Additionally, patient states he sometimes feels like he
can "smell or taste" colors as he has always been very special 
in
terms of the way he perceives colors. States that compared to
other people, colors "pop". Somehow relates this to how he has
always had a "knack for business", going on about gathering
resources for a business.

MANIA
Per HPI. Additionally, endorses feeling very energetic despite 
at
times getting very little amount of sleep, but is unable to
provide a time period for this stating that he has been this way

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Zyprexa, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself and/or others based upon 
static factors including active/chronic substance use, recent 
discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit, male gender, age, 
Caucasian race, and modifiable risk factors including psychosis, 
medication non-compliance, delusional thought content, and 
psychosocial stress (recent job loss).  The modifiable risk 
factors were addressed during this hospitalization through 
re-starting the patient  on an antipsychotic medication, 
individual and group psychotherapy aimed at improving coping 
skills, and psychoeducation and counseling regarding the 
cessation of substance use. Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective  factors, including is 
domiciled, has outpatient treaters, is future oriented and help 
seeking, denies SI/HI.    Overall, based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.
