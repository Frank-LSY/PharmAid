then eating a large meal the next day), sleep disturbance 
(normally sleeps 8 hours a night but since 4 weeks ago has been 
going for 36 hours without sleep then crashing and sleeping for

intense worthlessness/guilt ("I'm a piece of crap", self-hatred,

___ met with his academic advisor 1 week ago and shared some 
of his depressive symptoms, and the advisor recommended that he 
take some time off. He notes that his professors have started to 
question why he has not been attending classes for the past 4

features.  He reported prior episodes of similar symptoms as a 
teenager after being sent to boarding school. He denied any 
prior manic episodes and did not exhibit any symptoms concerning 
for mania during this admission. There was no evidence of 
paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, or disorganization to 
suggest psychosis.  No evidence of a neurocognitive disorder.  
Although he did report significant marijuana use that may be 
exacerbating symptoms, his multiple depressive episodes in s/o 
psychosocial stressors suggest a primary depressive disorder

medical condition was contributing to his presentation.
