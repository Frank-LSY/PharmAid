Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman, a senior student at ___ 
___, with a psychiatric history notable for depression, 
anxiety, longstanding self-injurious behaviors, one prior 
psychiatric hospitalization, no prior suicide attempts, who 
presented to ___ ED from her outpatient psychiatrist due to 
concerns for worsening depression and suicidal ideation.
.
The patients presentation was concerning for major depressive 
disorder with 1 to 2 months of worsening depressed mood, 
guilt/worry/anxiety about letting others down, erratic sleep, 
poor appetite, poor motivation, increasing frequency of panic 
attacks with dissociation, and concerns that she may partake in 
self-injurious behaviors such as walking into traffic. Pervasive 
symptoms of anxiety regarding constantly needing to be 
high-achieving since childhood, which appears to have been 
exacerbated in the recent months due to falling behind in 
classes, are concerning of generalized anxiety disorder. Exam 
was notable for depressed mood, dysthymic affect, and a thought 
process that was notably linear, logical, goal and future 
oriented.

The patients history of a chaotic childhood with onset of 
depression since ___ grade upon realizing she did not fit in 
with her classmates, and chronicity of depressive symptoms were 
concerning for an underlying personality component; however, a 
diagnosis of a personality disorder appeared unlikely given her 
good psychosocial functioning and young age. History was 
negative for symptoms concerning for mania/hypomania with 
negative family history of BPAD, so bipolar disorder was lower 
on the differential. History was also negative for concerning 
signs/symptoms of a psychotic disorder. While patient endorsed a 
traumatic sexual history, her current presentation was negative 
for symptoms that would meet criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. 
Finally, substance use and an organic etiology for her 
presentation were considered unlikely given her negative history 
for substance use disorders/negative tox screen, as well as her 
young age and good health.
.
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted to ___ 4 and upon 
admission, signed a Conditional Voluntary status which was 
accepted. She maintained her safety throughout her admission on 
15 minute checks and did not require physical or chemical 
restraints. 
.
#. Depression/Anxiety: Medical workup upon admission was within 
normal limits. Patient was compliant with pharmacotherapy 
offered and maintained excellent behavioral control during her 
admission, participating appropriately in her care. With her 
permission, treatment team contacted her outpatient 
psychiatrist, Dr. ___, who agreed with the plan for 
initiating lamotrigine 25 mg po daily for mood stabilization and 
risperidone 0.5 mg po bid prn for irritability/anxiety. Patient 
was on-board with initiating these medications after risks and 
benefits were discussed. Along with these medications, her home 
psychotropic regimen of sertraline 200 mg po daily and 
buproprion XL 300 mg po daily were continued; pharmacotherapy 
was tolerated well without adverse effects and patient expressed 
symptomatic improvement in mood, sleep, anxiety and 
restlessness. Treatment team also met with patients mother, who 
was on-board with the treatment plan as well as disposition. 
Plans for follow-up with BU re-entry and with Dr. ___ 
arranged. Of note, patient declined referral to a partial 
program at this time. She consistently denied suicidal ideation 
or thoughts of self harm throughout her psychiatric 
hospitalization.
.
On the day of discharge, the patient was noted to have very 
good mood, euthymic affect, future and goal oriented thought 
process, and displaying anticipation for returning to her social 
support group and partaking in a concert at ___. She denied 
suicidal or self-injurious ideation/plan.
.
#. Bright Red Blood Per Rectum: On day of admission, patient 
complained of rectal bleeding. A Medicine was placed and patient 
was found to have a stable H&H; per Medicines evaluation, 
etiology was determined to be most likely due to hemorrhoids. 
Patient was monitored closely for any signs/symptoms of blood 
loss, and she was started on a bowel regimen to reduce/prevent 
straining. A PCP appointment was made for the patient to 
follow-up with; the patient did not have any further complaints 
of rectal bleeding or pain and was asymptomatic by time of 
discharge.
