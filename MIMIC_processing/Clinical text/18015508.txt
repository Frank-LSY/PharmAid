2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are 
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular

mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic 
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta 
is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. ___ aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. There is ___ mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is ___ pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with borderline 
global systolic function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with 
normal free wall systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. 
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation referred from ___ with 
chest pain with jaw radiation found to have NSTEMI. 

# NSTEMI:  
Patient with chest pain and jaw radiation with elevated troponin 
found to have NSTEMI. Troponin peaked at 0.53 and down-trended. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization that showed 1 vessel CAD 
involving small caliber OM1 branch. But appearance is smooth and 
unlikely to be etiology for NSTEMI. In addition there was abrupt 
distal taper of very distal segment of LAD - and to consider 
thromboembolism in context of known AF. 

As such the patient was continued on heparin drip and remained 
chest pain free. He was started on atorvastatin 40 mg daily and 
xarelto 20 mg daily for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation 
given CHADS score of 2 and possible evidence of thromboembolism 
on cardiac cath. Echocardiogram post-cardiac catheterization was 
normal with EF of 55%. Aspirin dose was decreased to 81 mg daily 
from 325 mg daily. Patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin to 
take in the event of chest pain and instructed to call doctor 
and proceed to ___ Department if used and chest pain not 
resolved. Patient was counseled about smoking cessation.

# Sinus Bradycardia:  
Notably, patient had HR ranging from 45-55 without symptoms. 
Sotalol dose was not decreased as in past when decreased from 
120 mg BID as in the past this did not control heart rates for 
atrial fibrillation adequately. 

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  
Patient history of atrial fibrillation and CHADS score of 2. 
Given CHADS score and finding on cardiac cath of possible 
thromboembolism of very distal segment of LAD patient was 
started on xarelto 20 mg daily. Aspirin was decreased from 325 
mg to 81 mg daily in setting of xarelto use. Sotalol 120 mg BID 
was continued. 

# Hypertension  
- Sotalol continued as above 

# Hyperlipidemia  
Simvastatin stopped and atorvastatin 40 mg started.
 
# Cataracts  
Reported surgery for L eye cataract on ___. Continued Ketorolac 
0.5% Ophth Soln 1 DROP LEFT EYE BID and PrednisoLONE Acetate 1% 
Ophth. Susp. 1 DROP LEFT EYE BID  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=======================
-xarelto 20 mg daily
-aspirin dose decreased to 81 mg daily given xarelto use above
-atorvastatin 40 mg daily started
-simvastatin stopped and replaced with atorvastatin
-sublingual nitro written prn
-please continue to discuss smoking cessation with patient
-bradycardia, please follow up as an outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ 
because you had chest pain and a small heart attack. You had a 
procedure called a cardiac catheterization that showed ___ 
obvious focal blockage to explain your symptoms, though there 
was an area that looked as though it had a small clot in one of 
the blood vessels of the heart.

For this possible small clot in the blood vessel of the heart 
that could be from your atrial fibrillation we have started you 
on xarelto 20 mg daily which is a blood thinner. We have also 
decreased your aspirin dose to 81 mg daily because of the 
xarelto being started. Please do not take medications called 
NSAIDS including ibuprofen or naproxen as this can cause 
bleeding when combined with aspirin and xarelto.

We also started you on a medication called atorvastatin for 
cholesterol control in the setting of your small heart attack. 
We discussed the importance of smoking cessation with you as 
this increases your risk of worsening heart disease and heart 
attacks. We also gave you a medication called nitroglycerin to 
take if you experience chest pain. If your chest pain does not 
resolve after taking this medication then you need to call your 
doctor and go to the Emergency Room. 

Please follow up with your appointments below. 

It was a pleasure being involved in your care.
