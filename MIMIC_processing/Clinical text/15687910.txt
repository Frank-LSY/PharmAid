and
stood at the edge of the roof for ~1 hour, then walked back

standing there thinking of jumping because he felt cold and
wanted to be warm.  Pt voices his reasons to live include his

club at his school. But, he continues to have suicidal ideation
with plan to jump off his roof. Pt endorses anhedonia, poor
appetite, insomnia, fatigue, worthlessness, diminished
concentration, hopelessness, and recurrent thoughts of death. Pt
also reports AH stating that he is "better off dead" and CAH
telling him to jump off the roof. He is unsure when he voices
began, but notes it is one voice, and states it sounds like his
own voice but he knows it is not. Last heard AH yesterday. 
Denies
VH, but states he while he was standing on the roof, when he
looked up he could imagine himself falling. Regarding PTSD,
denies nightmares or flashbacks but endorses intrusive thoughts
of the trauma and hypervigilence. When asked about h/o manic
symptoms, patient is vague in his answer - "I was happy, and I'd
say a bit manic." But has a difficult time characterizing this
further.

On admission to inpatient psychiatry, patient was amenable to
being interviewed. He was pleasant and cooperative. His affect
was somewhat restricted and dysphoric and he had poor eye
contact. His speech was slow at times and was soft in terms of
volume. Corroborated HPI above. Reports climbing onto roof and

time was in ___ or ___. Reports SIB (superficial cutting) prior
to presenting to ___ he first began cutting in high school but
hadn't done so again until day before presenting to ___.
Attributes these behaviors to stress of identifying as LGBT. He
"came out" to his parents while in the ___ and did not feel
supported. His parents are religious and, per patient, mother 
has
had a "homophobic" response to this revelation. In addition,
patient wishes his parents were more "supportive" and feels as
though they often invalidate his feelings.

He describes his mood as "calm" and "detached" stating he is 
"not
really feeling anything." He endorses depression and describes 
it
as being "too tired to feel." His sleep is "not good" as he
estimates he get 2 to 6 hours of sleep a night ___ rumination
(being LGBT). He endorses anhedonia as he is unable to enjoy
hobbies (music, writing, reading). He rates his appetite as "not
great" but reports he is able to eat and denies recent weight
loss. His energy is "low" and his concentration is impaired as 
he
often "spaces out" while at work. He denies feeling anxious or
symptoms concerning for mania. He continues to experience SI w/
same plan to jump from a height but notes the frequency and
intensity have subsided somewhat. Similarly, he continues to 
have
urge for SIB. He initially endorsed symptoms concerning for AH 
or
CAH but clarified that it seems more like "obsessive thoughts"
that are critical of him. He denied experiencing these symptoms
during our interview. He also denied VH, IOR, thought
broadcasting or insertion, and he did not appear to be 
responding
to internal stimuli. Reports experiencing a panic attack 
("forget
how to breath", "cry", "shake"; began in high school) last week

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
# Depressive episode: aborted suicide attempt prior to admission 
with SIB (cutting)
Patient presented with symptoms including worsening depression, 
anxiety, suicidal ideation with aborted suicidal plan to jump 
off his roof prior to admission, and self injurious behavior 
(cutting). Notably, patient reported that this was an impulsive 
plan  he had gone about his day running errands and when he 
returned home he made decision to go up to the roof, where he 
stood in the center, not on the edge, for ~20 minutes, then went 
downstairs because he said he was cold. On admission, patient 
was pleasant, cooperative, somewhat restricted. He described his 
mood as calm and detached. He reported poor sleep, anhedonia, 
poor appetite, low energy, impaired concentration. He continued 
to endorse SI, though reported intensity and frequency were 
beginning to subside. He continued to report urge for SIB. He 
initially endorsed symptoms concerned for command auditory 
hallucinations, but on further clarification, patient endorsed 
more obsessive and self critical thoughts, where he hears his 
own voice speaking to him negatively. 
.
Presentation was determined to be consistent with depressive 
episode in setting of significant psychosocial stressors, 
primarily including fear of disclosing his queer identity to his 
religious and conservative family. Of note, patient reported 
that he did disclose this identity to his parents while in the 
___, as he felt since he was admitted for suicide plan, he had 
nothing left to lose. He stated that his parents were not 
supportive of his identity during this conversation, though did 
express they would continue to support him financially and be 
involved in his life.
.
Patient was started on sertraline this admission - he was 
initially started on 12.5mg daily and uptitrated to 100mg daily 
by the time of discharge. He reported improved mood and energy 
after starting this medication. Treatment team monitored for 
activation as a side effect of the SSRI, but there was no 
disturbance in thought process, tangentiality or impulsivity to 
indicate this improved energy was a manic flip. Rather, this was 
more likely a sense of relief from getting help with his long 
standing depression. 
Patient was also started on ramelteon for sleep with good 
effect.
. 
Patient was active and engaged in the milieu. After starting 
medicine and several days into admission, patient denied 
suicidal ideation and plan to self harm. He was forward 
thinking, positive, and expressed strengthened coping mechanisms 
and plans to remain safe upon discharge from the hospital. On 
discharge, he reported good mood, being able to enjoy things he 
didn't enjoy for a long time, no suicidal ideation, thinking 
about his future plans and commitment to being engaged in 
psychiatric treatment. 

Patient was connected to outpatient providers at ___ 
to continue treatment upon discharge. He also expressed interest 
in attending groups at ___ as well.

and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. The patient was pleasant, 
interactive, and supportive in these groups and per OT, made 
notable progress daily. He was social in the milieu.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting sertraline, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team. The patient 
appeared able to understand and consented to begin the 
medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself and/or others based upon his 
history of suicide planning, history of abuse, history of 
substance use, male gender, marital status (single), and LGBTQ 
identity. His modifiable risk factors included suicidal 
ideation, lack of connection to outpatient providers, 
hopelessness, limited coping skills, limited familial support, 
and insomnia. These risk factors were addressed with initiation 
of medication (sertraline), providing psychosocial support, 
encouraging coping skills and participation in milieu therapy, 
and connection to outpatient providers for discharge.

The patient is being discharged with many protective risk 
factors, including help seeking nature, future oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to siblings and friends, and 
strong social supports from friends.
Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness.
