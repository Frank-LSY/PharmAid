History of Present Illness:
 ___ year old woman with history of stage IA (T1cN0Mx) invasive 
ductal carcinoma of the right breast, grade I, ER positive, PR 
positive, HER2/neu negative, LVI indeterminate, Oncotype DX 8, 
s/p wire-localized partial mastectomy and SLND on ___ on 
tamoxifen who presents with chest pain.  
 Patient was feeling well, teaching at school and noted sudden 
onset of chest pressure and pain radiating to her back. She did 
not have any associated lightheadedness, dizziness, neck pain, 
palpitations or shortness of breath. She notes that the pain is 
worse lying flat. She went to see the school nurse and was then 
sent to ___ via ambulance.  
 
 Despite negative ED work up for multiple emergent potential 
causes, patient is still complaining of moderately severe chest 
pain, and shows no signs of malingering, etc. She is otherwise a 
very "normal" person. Therefore, uncomfortable discharging 
straight to home while still symptomatic, but no clear endpoint 
to make her good ED OBS candidate. Will admit for observation, 
with hopes that she will "declare herself" one way or the other 
with some time.  
 In the ED, initial vitals were:  
 98.0 80 129/85 97% RA  
 
 Labs were notable for: normal CBC, normal chem panel, normal 
LFTs and lipase. Cardiac biomarkers negative x 2.  
 CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 CTA: No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
No acute findings. Postprocedure changes in the right breast 
without prior CT for comparison; continue dedicated breast 
imaging followup  
 Patient was given: IV morphine, 1L IVF, IV Zofran.  
 
 Despite negative workup, ED was concerned about patient's chest 
pain and did not think straightforward for ED OBS therefore 
admitted to medicine for further workup.  
 Vitals prior to transfer:  
 97.8 73 117/74 18 99% RA  
 
 On the floor, Ms. ___ is feeling better without significant 
chest pain, palpitations, and is breathing comfortably.

 STRESS EKG: ___
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year woman with history of breast cancer 

stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma s/p partial mastectomy on 
tamoxifen 
and radiotherapy referred to the lab for atypical chest 
discomfort 
evaluation. The patient exercised for 12.5 minutes on a modified 
___ 
protocol and stopped due to fatigue. The peak estimated METs 
capacity is 
10.5 representing a good exercise tolerance for her age. She did 
not 
report any chest, arm, back or neck discomfort throughout the 
test. 
Rhythm was sinus with no ectopy during exercise and in recovery. 
No ST 
segments changes were noted throughout the study. Appropriate 
hemodynamic response to exercise and recovery. 
IMPRESSION: No angina or ischemic EKG changes. Appropriate 
hemodynamic 
response and good exercise capacity. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of stage IA 
(T1cN0Mx) invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast s/p 
partial mastectomy and XRT on tamoxifen who presented with 
substernal chest pain x 4 hours. Troponins negative x 2. CT 
chest negative for PE. EKG significant for normal sinus rhythm. 
Chest pain improved with sitting up, however, no other history 
or EKG findings consistent with pericarditis. Chest pain was 
partially reproducible and resolved with pain medications. Given 
her history of radiation and increase risk for coronary artery 
disease, she underwent EKG stress test which showed no angina or 
ischemic EKG changes. Appropriate hemodynamic response and good 
exercise capacity. She will follow up with her PCP.

#Chest Pain:  
Patient presents with acute onset of substernal chest pressure 
with EKG without ischemic changes and negative cardiac 
biomarkers x3. EKG significant for normal sinus rhythm, normal R 
wave progression, without PR depressions or ST elevation. DDx 
for pain includes unstable angina, pleuritic chest pain, 
costochondritis, pericarditis, or esophageal spasm or GERD. 
There is no evidence of acute plaque rupture or PE with negative 
cardiac biomarkers and negative CTA. She was monitored on 
telemetry without event. Given her history of radiation and 
associated increased risk for coronary artery disease, she 
underwent EKG stress test which showed no angina or ischemic EKG 
changes with appropriate hemodynamic response and good exercise 
capacity. 

#Breast Cancer:  
Continued home tamoxifen - she is experiencing several 
side-effects since initiating Tamoxifen (including intermittent 
rashes, irregular menstrual bleeding, and spontaneous crying), 
which she plans to discuss with her oncologist at her next 
follow-up appointment. 

#Supplements: Continued home iron, MVI, Vit D   

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Etiology of chest pain is unclear; differential includes MSK, 
anxiety or possible side-effect of tamoxifen. Please continue to 
monitor symptoms and pursue further workup as necessary
