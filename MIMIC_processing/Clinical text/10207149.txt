Blood Cultures Pending:

-----------------
Imaging:

___ (PA & LAT) IMPRESSION: ___ 
consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.

___ HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS, MRI CERVICAL, 
THORACIC,
IMPRESSION: 1. Background of extensive supra and infratentorial 
burned out  demyelinating lesions with ___ corresponding 
postcontrast enhancement or abnormal DWI signal intensity. 2. 
There is ___ acute intracranial abnormality, mass lesions or mass 
effect.
 IMPRESSION: 1. There are numerous multifocal small 
intramedullary demyelinating lesions involving all levels of the 
spinal cord with superimposed multifocal spinal cord volume loss 
and ___ convincing postcontrast enhancement to suggest disease 
activity.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history notable for 
multiple sclerosis (on ocrelizumab) c/b urinary retention, bowel 
incontinence, and cognitive decline presenting with several days 
of gross hematuria, generalized weakness, and speech 
disturbance. 
MRI brain and C-spine images showed multifocal demyelinating 
lesions without definite enhancement, including a prominent 
(old) lesion at the cervico-medullary junction left greater than 
right. Urinary cultures, however, found pan-sensitive Proteus 
mirabilis >100,000 CFU/mL, treated with a course of ceftriaxone 
that was transitioned to cefpodoxime and completed during this 
hospitalization. The worsening weakness and speech disturbance 
on presentation therefore likely represented exacerbation of 
prior deficits in setting of UTI in a patient with progressive 
MS. ___ evidence for new/active lesion. Patient evaluated by 
speech and swallow for dietary modification as well as physical 
therapy, who recommended further rehabilitation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
1. Outpatient follow up for resolved episode of hematuria.
2. Outpatient MS ___ for reinitiation of ocrelizumab as 
indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized for overall weakness as well as concerns 
for blood in your urine that was initially concerning for a 
flare of your multiple sclerosis. You had an MRI performed with 
contrast that did not show any new MS lesions, but your urine 
cultures showed that you have a urinary tract infection that 
likely caused your overall weakness. You completed a course of 
antibiotics for your infection, with improvement in your overall 
strength. You did not have further episodes of bloody or 
blood-tinged urine.  

Please follow up with your primary care provider within one week 
of discharge from your facility as well as with your MS 
specialist at the appointment listed below.  

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your care,
Then ___ Neurology Team
