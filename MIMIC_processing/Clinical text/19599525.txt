History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of
thyroidectomy and osteoporosis who presents with chest pain. 

Ms. ___ was in her usual state of health until around
10:30AM on ___ when she was in exercise class which she attends
twice every week. She felt diaphoretic and was laboring
throughout the class and decided to sit down. She then felt like
she had a pulled muscle in her chest which persisted throughout

day,
but continued to feel diaphoretic with a chest tightness. She
took a second aspirin. The pain resolved spontaneously at 7:30pm
yesterday evening. 

She presented to ___ this morning and was
found to have an elevated troponin with T wave inversions and an
ST elevation in a single isolated lead. She was chest pain free
at that time. She was therefore transferred to ___.

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of focal consolidation, pulmonary edema or pleural 
effusions.

___ TTE:
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is no 
evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There 
is normal left ventricular wall thickness with
a normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is mildly-to-moderately depressed secondary to
extensive circumferential apical hypokinesis sparing only the 
basal segments. The visually estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction is 40%. There is a mild (peak 19 
mmHg) resting left ventricular outflow tract
gradient with an increase to 29 mmHg (peak) with Valsalva. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal
free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 
(TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a
normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no
mitral valve prolapse. There is valvular systolic anterior 
motion (___). There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be estimated. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: extensive apical hypokinesis

___ Cardiac Cath:
Findings
 No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
 Normal LVEDP.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
thyroidectomy and osteoporosis who presents with chest pain and 
was found to have an NSTEMI with complete resolution of 
symptoms. Coronary cath was non-obstructive.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Repeat TTE in ___ to reassess for improvement in apical 
hypokinesis
[] Patient discharged on aspirin 81mg and clopidogrel. Reassess 
in ___ months (___) if patient should continue these 
medications
[] Started on atorvostatin, metoprolol during admission for CAD. 
Will need follow-up for these medications--including appropriate 
lab follow up and verification that patient is tolerating the 
medications
[] patient hypotensive on Lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily, continue to 
assess if patient can restart medication 

ACUTE ISSUES:

#NSTEMI:

troponin elevation consistent with NSTEMI. Her sister similarly 
had no risk factors and had a MI in her early ___. Started on 
heparin drip. TTE demonstrated LVEF 40% with extensive apical 
hypokinesis. Cardiac cath demonstrated mid LAD with focal 30% 
stenosis vs normal variant appearance. Started during admission 
on atorvostatin, and metoprolol. Discharged on these medications 
in addition to clopidogrel and aspirin. She could not tolerate 
2.5mg PO Lisinopril due to hypotension. 

#Hyperlipidemia
Total cholesterol 215, LDL 135, HDL 69. 
- Atorvastatin 80mg 

#Hypotension
after cath patient had bleeding at incision site. BP decreased 
to ___ while working with ___ otherwise has had normal BPs. We

metoprolol to 12.5mg PO daily. Monitored overnight with no 
issues and discharged with stable BP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
-  You were given medications for your heart
-  You underwent a procedure to evaluate the blood flow to your 
heart. You did not have significant narrowing of the blood 
vessels to your heart. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Be sure to take all your medications and attend all of your 
appointments listed below. 
- It is very important to take your aspirin and clopidogrel 
(also known as Plavix) 
- These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the 
heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart 
attack.  
- You are also given other new medications to help your heart
- Please do not take Lisinopril and take metoprolol succinate 
12.5mg PO daily.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___! 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish
