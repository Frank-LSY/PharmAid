History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old
male with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and intermittent 
episodes
of altered mental status who presents after another episode of
altered mental status associated with hypoglycemia.

Per report, patient had a 15-minute long episode of acute 
altered
mental status during which he was aggressive and had "erratic
movements." During the event, he reportedly stated that he felt
like he was going to be killed and needed to be restrained. When
EMS arrive, patient as noted to be hypoglycemic to 38. His 
mental
status reportedly improved prior to any interventions. Patient
remembers the episode and reports not feeling quite right.

Per family, the patient has had episodes of altered mental 
status
in the past, during which patient would become unresponsive and
reclusive. Over the past two months, however, these episodes 
have
changed, and the patient now becomes aggressive and erratic. The
episodes resolve spontaneously. He has been evaluated by 
multiple
neurologists with workup for TIA, CVA, and seizures reportedly
negative.

Patient does not take any antihyperglycemic medications. He
denies toxic ingestions, including alcohol, marijuana, and
illicit drugs. He has no new medications and denies any systemic
symptoms.

In the ED, his exam was unremarkable. He was AAOx3 and neuro 
exam
was nonfocal. Vital signs remained stable. FSBG were 168 (2259),
78 (0434), and 154 (0612). ECG showed NSR with rate 62, with
normal axis, intervals. No ischemic changes. UA was remarkable
only for trace protein and few bacteria. CBC, chem10, and LFTs
were within normal limits. A urine/serum drug screen was not
performed.

With regard to the recent workup of these episodes of altered
mental status, he/family report that he has been evaluated by
neurology in ___, Unfortunately, these records are not
presently available.

On arrival to the floor,  he confirmed the above history.
Notably, he denies palpitations and diaphoresis during the
episodes. He is able to remember most of the episodes however he
reports last night that he does not remember speaking to the EMS
workers in the ambulance. He reports his symptoms frequently
occur at ___ ___. No history of seizures. States he has had
a full neuro workup in ___ including 48 hr eeg, CT scans,

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
___ year old male with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents
after an episode of agitation and erratic movement associated
with hypoglycemia. Subsequently found to have non-fasting 
fingerstick glucoses in the ___ during 72 hour fast, confirmed 
with serum glucose. 

PLAN:
#Hypoglycemia
#?Insulinoma 
#altered mental status 
The patient admitted following a 15 minute long episode of acute 
altered mental status in which he became aggressive and had 
erratic movements. EMS  fingerstuck the patient which was ___. He 
was otherwise asymptomatic (no 
diaphoresis/palpitations/tachycardia.) He has had several of 
these episodes over the past year and reports that in ___ 
he has seen 2 neurologists who have been unable to find a 
neurologic etiology (he reports a 48 hr EEG that was negative 
and multiple MRIs which were negative for evidence of TIA). He 
does not remember these episodes entirely. Over the past year, 
he has increased his PO intake as the only symptom he can recall 
after the episodes end is feeling hungry. 

During this hospitalization, we had the patient on q4hr 
fingersticks. On ___, overnight the fingersticks dipped to the 
___. We consulted endocrine who suggested a 72 hour fast. The 
fast was positive, showing fingersticks in the ___ and ___ that 
were confirmed with the serum glucose. After confirmation of the 
low blood sugar with a serum glucose, we added on an insulin 
level, proinsulin level, beta hydroxybutyrate, and a c-peptide. 
These labs were pending at time of discharge. Per endocrinology 
recommendations, further work up can occur in the outpatient 
setting. The patient desires to fly home to ___. He 
reports having a PCP ___ appointment on ___. He will need 
outpatient endocrine follow up as well, our endocrinologists 
have provided him with their contact information should he have 
difficulty scheduling appointments in ___. Our 
endocrinologists are concerned that he likely has a insulinoma 
given his positive 72 hour fast however without the labs being 
finalized we cannot make this diagnosis definitively at this 
time. They also feel that MEN1 and MEN2a are unlikely given the 
lack of a pituitary tumor and his advanced age. We feel that the 
standard symptoms of hypoglycemia 
(diaphoresis/palpitations/tachycardia) are likely masked by his 
beta blocker and thus that he should check his glucose finger 
stick frequently and consume a snack as appropriate.

At time of discharge, we counseled the patient about the 
importance of eating 3 meals a day and having snacks between the 
meals to maintain his blood glucose. We also provided him with 
hypoglycemia education via one of our nurses and provided him 
with a glucometer. 

#Hyperparathyroidism
Patient with history of parathyroid resection secondary to
hyperparathyroidism in the past. Per endocrine note, patient
reports baseline Ca ~10.5. PTH elevated to 96. Endocrine 
consulted in
this setting given concomitant hypoglycemia and concern for
endocrine syndrome, endocrine feels that this is unlikely given
his advanced age, feel the calcium is likely iso mild 
dehydration. He has a history of pituitary adenoma resection 
however our endocrine team suggests that the pathology be 
reviewed if possible to rule out neoplasia. They feel that this 
is unlikely however and that the patient is likely at baseline 
calcium levels with some concomitant dehydration. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
===============

-Continued home bystolic and amlodipine

-Continued ezetimibe 10mg daily

-continued home allopurinol

===================
[]Needs to see PCP ___

___.

[] He and his wife, ___, was informed that until his follow-up

should avoid driving will be determined by his medical team in 
___.
