History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a ___ right handed man with PMH significant for
HLD and gout who presents after a 2 hour period of amnesia and
confusion this morning. History was gathered from the patient,
his wife and daughter (a GYN attending here). The patient woke 
up
in his USOH. His wife left for a class at 8am and he was find at
that time. The patient spoke to a friend at 9am and was
reportedly normal. Starting sometime after ___, the patient 
started
repeatedly calling his wife and leaving the same voicemail 
asking
her to call him back. Around 11am he called his daughter and
repeatedly said "I dont know where mom is", "there are two dogs
in the house and I don't know why" (they are currently dog
sitting). He also said "I'm having an out of body experience and
I don't know whats going on." His daughter asked about the 
events
of the early morning and last night and the patient could not
recall anything. She asked about more distant memories and these
were intact. 

The patient's daughter called a neighbor who went to check on 
his
and found him to be more calm but still asking where he wife 
was.

started to recall the events of the early morning and last 
night.

not recall calling his wife or talking to his daughter on the
phone.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ right handed man with PMH significant for 
HLD and gout who presented after a 2 hour period of amnesia on 
the day of admission. Neurologic examination on admission was 
unremarkable aside from subtle errors with low frequency naming 
though short term memory appeared intact.  He continued to have 
poor memory for the time interval from the morning of admission.

His CT/CTA were unremarkable and subsequent MRI showed no 
hippocampal ischemia, no acute infarct or bleed. no mass seen. A 
few scattered areas of T2 hyperintensities were noted.  EEG 
(prelim report): No seizures or epileptiform discharges seen.  
LDL-97.

The patient's story is reasonable for transient global amnesia 
with acute onset of anterograde amnesia with relatively sparing 
of retrograde memory.  Etiology is unclear, as MRI brain did not 
show an ischemic infarct, and EEG did not show evidence of a 
seizure or seizure focus.  He is under no increased stress and 
sleep is adequate. Telemetry did not show any atrial 
fibrillation. TTE was deferred for now given that the yield of 
the study would be very low.  Though we do not think this was a 
TIA, we performed an abbreviated stroke workup to assess risk 
factors, which were well-controlled.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 

-follow up final EEG read and hba1c test
-continue aspirin 
-continue Lipitor
- goal normotension
- discharge to home

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ Neurology on ___ after an episode 
of transient memory loss.  We admitted you for an MRI which 
showed no acute stroke.  We also performed an EEG that showed no 
evidence that you had seizure.  We think that your episode is 
due to a condition called transient global amnesia (TGA).  This 
is similar to a transient ischemia attack (TIA) of the parts of 
your brain that control memory.  The good news is that it is 
uncommon for an episode like you had to occur again.  We sent 
blood work to check for elevated cholesterol and diabetes, and 
we will follow up the results of these studies after discharge.  
We will ask you to follow up in Stroke Clinic and we arrange 
this clinic appointment on ___ and call you with the 
information.

 
Followup Instructions:
