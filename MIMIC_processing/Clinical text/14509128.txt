Imaging 
=======
___ MRI head w/ and w/out 
1. Stable 1.2 cm hematoma centered in the right lentiform 
nucleus, without 
evidence for an underlying mass or infarction.  No evidence of 
prior 
hemorrhages on gradient echo images. 
2. Supratentorial white matter T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities, 
progressed since 
___, are nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small 
vessel 
ischemic disease in this age group. 
3. Status post left maxillary antrostomy and partial left 
ethmoidectomy.  
Extensive residual left ethmoid and moderate residual left 
maxillary sinus 
disease.  Stable small polyp in the left posterior nasal cavity. 

  
___ CTA head and neck 
1. Stable 1.2 cm hematoma in the right lentiform nucleus with 
stable mild 
effacement of the right lateral ventricle and stable mild 
leftward shift of midline structures.  No evidence for active 
contrast extravasation. 
2. Stable 4 mm laterally directed aneurysm at the left M1 
bifurcation compared to the ___ MRA.  Questionable 1 mm 
laterally directed outpouching at the junction of the left 
anterior cerebral artery with the anterior communicating artery, 
not clearly seen on the ___ MRA which may be secondary to small 
size and differences in modalities. 
3. Normal neck CTA. 
4. Multinodular goiter with nodules measuring up to 1.3 cm.  ACR 
guidelines do not recommend routine cerebellar fat evaluations 
of nodules smaller than 1.5 cm in this age group.

tonsillar region. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):

previously 
evaluated.

imaging 
features, unless there is additional clinical concern, ___ 
College of 
Radiology guidelines do not recommend further evaluation for 
incidental 
thyroid nodules less than 1.0 cm in patients under age ___ or 
less than 1.5 cm  in patients age ___ or ___. Suspicious 
findings include: Abnormal lymph nodes (those displaying 
enlargement, calcification, cystic components and/or increased 
enhancement) or invasion of local tissues by the thyroid nodule.

Imaging: White Paper of the ACR Incidental Findings Committee".

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old RH woman with AVR not on AC s/p fall to the left 
found to have a small right BG hemorrhage, likely hypertensive. 

#Right basal ganglia hemorrhage: On admission imaging there was 
a right basal ganglia hyperdensity noted on CT. MRI 
re-demonstrated this hemorrhage that was stable in size without 
evidence of CAA, acute ischemic infarcts, or evidence of 
underlying mass. Due to location of hemorrhage it was felt like 
etiology was hypertensive. She was initially on nicardapine gtt 
for blood pressure control. She was then weaned off and started 
on amlodipne 2.5mg. She was also continued on half her home 
metoprolol. 

# GI/Nutrition: Patient was evaluate for dysphagia and she 
passed her bedside swallow study. She was started on heart 
healthy diet.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of feeling weak and 
leaning to the left the resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC 
STROKE. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 - High blood pressure 
 - Atrial fibrillation 

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 - start taking amlodipine to help keep your blood pressure 
controlled 
 - The dose of your metoprolol was decreased to half what you 
were taking before
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team
