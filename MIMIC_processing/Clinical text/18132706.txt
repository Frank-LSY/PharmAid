Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a 
history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who was admitted to 
the gynecology service after undergoing total abdominal 
hysterectomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy, right salpingectomy, 
and lysis of adhesions for symptomatic fibroid uterus. Please 
see the operative report for full details.
Her post-operative course was complicated by a fever to 101.3 on 
post-operative day 1. Her exam at the time was within normal 
limits without evidence of acute intra-abdominal or 
cardiopulmonary pathology, or DVT. Urinalysis and urine culture 
were negative for infection. CXR was stable from prior. She 
defervesced with acetaminophen, and a clear etiology was not 
identified. She remained stable with no further fevers for the 
rest of her admission.
The remainder of her post-operative course was uncomplicated. 
Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with IV 
hydromorphone and ketorolac. On post-operative day 1, her urine 
output was adequate so her foley was removed and she voided 
spontaneously. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she 
was transitioned to oral acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and 
oxycodone.
For her diabetes, she was on an insulin sliding scale before 
being transitioned to her home medications prior to discharge. 
By post-operative day 3, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.
