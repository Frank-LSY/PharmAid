Imaging:
=======
 Portable Chest xray AP
IMPRESSION:    
Left base opacity which could be due to consolidation from 
infection or 
aspiration versus atelectasis.  Dedicated PA and lateral views 
would be 
helpful for further evaluation if/when patient able. 

___ Non-contrast Head CT:
IMPRESSION:   
1. Interval increase subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying right 
cerebellum. 
2. Stable inferior right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
3. Prominence of the bilateral extra-axial spaces may partially 
represent 
chronic bilateral subdural hemorrhages versus involutional 
changes. 
4. Complete opacification of the left sphenoid sinus with 
central high density 
material may represent inspissated secretions or fungal 
colonization.  
Thickening of the walls of the sphenoid sinus suggests chronic 
sinusitis. 
5. Evolving right parietal scalp soft tissue swelling and 
hematoma. 

___ Chest Xray PA and Lat
IMPRESSION:    
Rapidly improving left lower lobe opacity favors atelectasis or 
aspiration over an infectious pneumonia. 

___ CTA Head
IMPRESSION:   
1. Study is limited due to poor bolus tracking.  Allowing for 
the limitations, intracranial arteries appear unremarkable. 
2. Right cerebellum subarachnoid hemorrhage, right frontal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and prominent bifrontal subdural 
space are similar to 14 hr ago. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with AAA, hypertension, hypothyroidism with h/o 
multiple falls who presented s/p fall on ___ found to have small 
intracerebral hemorrhage and chronic subdural collections. 

# Falls complicated by cerebellar SAH, frontal IPH, and chronic 
SDH:  Pt presented s/p mechanical fall on ___.  Serial CT scans 
show small stable cerebellar SAH, frontal IPH, and chronic SDH 
that was non-operative per neurosurgery. He has had multiple 
falls with a significant one ___ resulting in residual 
dysarthria. He reports he falls at least once monthly (inside 
and outside), often when turning. Of note, he has been evaluated 
by neurology in the recent past and he is undergoing a workup 
for a possible neurodegenerative disorder as the etiology of his 
falls (provider documents in physical chart and faxed to 
neurology/concussion clinic).  He was evaluated by ___ and OT who 
recommended discharge home with ___. He was provided with a 
walker prior to discharge for improved gait stability and fall 
prevention. He will follow up with PCP, neurology/concussion 
clinic, and neurosurgery. He will have a repeat CT head ___. 

# Post-concussive syndrome: Mental status exam notable for 
diminished attention and recall. Also noted on OT assessment. ___ 
assessment notable for impaired visual function, balance and 
coordination likely due to central vestibular dysfunction given 
known location of injury.  As above, pt will have ___ at home 
with a new walker and will follow up with the 
___ clinic and neurosurgery as outpatient. 

# Possible aspiration:  CXR on admission with possible evidence 
of aspiration prompted a speech and swallow consult.  Bedside 
speech and swallow evaluation demonstrated "soft signs of 
aspiration" and a diet of regular solids and nectar thick 
liquids was recommended.  Of note, pt did not demonstrate any 
clinical evidence of pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis during 
his hospital course.  

# Hypertension:  Continued home lisinopril and metoprolol.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home Levothyroxine.

# Possible CAD:  Despite neurosurgery clearance for restarting 
aspirin, held home aspirin at discharge given prescribed for 
primary prevention.  Pt and family denies history of MI or PCI.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of your during your stay at ___. 
 You presented after a fall and were found to have small areas 
of bleeding around and in your brain, as well as old blood 
around your brain from previous falls.  Multiple CT scans of 
your head showed that the bleeding was stable.  You were 
evaluated by the neurosurgeons who determined that the bleeding 
was non-operative.  Given your multiple recent falls and 
evidence of post-concussion syndrome, a referral to the 
concussion clinic at ___ was arranged.  In addition, you will 
follow up with your PCP and neurosurgery after discharge. 

The following are recommendations from neurosurgery:

Activity
========

No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
===========
Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Ibuprofen, 
Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. Please 
continue to hold your home baby aspirin given it is for primary 
prevention. 
You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

Headache is one of the most common symptom after a brain 
bleed. 
Most headaches are not dangerous but you should call your 
doctor if the headache gets worse, develop arm or leg weakness,

headache. 
Mild pain medications may be helpful with these headaches but
