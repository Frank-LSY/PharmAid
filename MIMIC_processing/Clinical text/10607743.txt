Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with hx of htn, hypothyroidism, prior episodes of LGIB x2, 
presenting with hematochezia x12 hours. Pt describes this as the 
third episode in her life of BRBPR. 
Pt describes onset of BRBPR starting at 4:30 am on day of 
presentation. She describes initial onset of mild abdominal 
discomfort, subsequently passing bowel movements with loose 
stools mixed with bright red blood, q15 minutes. She had 
associated weakness, profuse diaphoresis, which actually 
preceded the onset of loose, bloody stools. Diaphoresis resolved 
with the onset of loose stools, with residual chills and marked 
fatigue. She was subsequently able to fall asleep, and slept 
until 8 am. Beginning at 8 am, she has had q20 minutes bowel 
movements, still with visible bright red blood, which she 
describes as light, pink red watery, with flakes of residual 
bright red blood. Output is now clear, watery, but continues to 
have flecks of blood, and continues to have the urge to defecate 
q20 minutes. She notes bright red blood on the toilet paper. 

This episode reminds her of the prior episodes of BRBPR, which 
were similarly occurred without warning, without associated 
abdominal pain. The etiology of her prior episodes was 
attributed to ?hemorrhoidal bleeding, with a question raised of 
ischemic colitis at ___ in ___ - although 
atypical presentation given absence of preceding hypotension or 
abdominal pain. She denies lightheadedness, presyncope or 
syncope. The day prior to her presentation, she was in her usual 
state of health, without F/C, diarrhea, N/V. Repeat colonoscopy 
___ was stable, with diverticulosis and internal 
hemorrhoids. Interestingly, all three episodes have had onset at 
about 2:30 in the morning.

Colonoscopy ___:
Findings:  

 Protruding Lesions Small grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were 
noted.  

 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the 
ascending colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon.  
 
Impression: Diverticulosis of the ascending colon, descending 
colon and sigmoid colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids 

# OSH Abd CT (___): Abnormally thickened segment of small 
intestine the right lower quandrant induration of the adjacent 
fat and fluid tracking into the mesentery.  Small bowel proximal 
is mildly distended but the oral contrast passes through this 
segement of small intestine into a nondistended colon.  This 
finding has a wide differential including infectious, 
inflammatory and ischemic processes.  7 mm indeterminate low 
density lesion lateral segment left lobe of liver

# OSH Abd CT (___): Abnormal appearance of the transverse, 
descending and sigmoid colon compatible with colitis.  This is a 
new finding since the prior CT examination dated ___.  
Differential diagnostic consideration s include inflammatory and 
infectious etiologies.  There is no evidence of pneumatosis or 
an enhancement pattern to favor an ischemic etiology since the 
prior examination there has been improvement of the previously 
noted abnormal loops of small bowel previously thought to be 
consistent with enteritis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o htn, hypothyroidism, prior episodes of LGIB x2, 
presenting with hematochezia x12 hours.

# Hematochezia, watery diarrhea: Ms. ___ was admitted with 
bloody bowel movement.  Initial consideration was possibility of 
diverticular or hemorrhoidal bleed.  However, the regularity of 
the bowel movement with the watery character lead the 
possibility of alternative explanations.  Serial H/H here showed 
stable H/H levels without any significant drop.
   A CRP was checked and found to be elevate at 20.  
Furthermore, OSH abd CT (___) showed colitis in transverse, 
descending, sigmoid colon.  For consideration of an inflammatory 
component, GI was consulted.  The thought was that her symptoms 
were most consistent with ischemic colitis.  Although there were 
no clear signs of atherosclerosis on the CT scan, she was noted 
to have low BP, particularly while asleep.  She was noted to 
have a SBP ___ while taking a nap.  It is therefore not 
coincidental, that each of these bleeding episodes (this 
represents the ___ one), has occurred at night time while 
asleep.  As a result, the lisinopril will be held on discharge.  
Without the lisinopril here, her SBP has been stable in 110s 
while awake.
   She was able to tolerate a regular diet without difficulty 
and was discharged in good condition. 

# Leukocytosis: likely stress response. normalized the following 
day. 

# Hypertension:  As noted above, lisinopril was held - during 
and after hospitalization. 

# Hypothyroidism: 
- Continue home levothyroxine

# Hot flashes:
- Continue home lorazepam prn

# FEN: Clear liquid diet, no current indication for IVF

# PPx: Low risk for VTE

# CONSULTS: GI
# Code status: FULL - presumed

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

   It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you were 
admitted with bloody bowel movements.  Your blood levels were 
closely monitored and there was no sign of significant decrease 
in red blood count during this hospitalization.  The 
Gastrointestinal team was consulted for consideration of 
sigmoidoscopy, but it was felt that your symptoms were most 
consistent with ischemic colitis.  It was felt that with the 
increased dose of lisinopril, your BP decreases while asleep - 
leading to insufficient blood flow to the colon at night.  (It 
may thus may not be coincidental that these episodes initiate 
while asleep).

For this reason, please hold off on taking the lisinopril until 
you see Dr. ___.  During this hospitalization, your blood 
pressure was normal even without taking the lisinopril 
medications.  Please discuss with Dr. ___ the 
plan for restarting vs. discontinuing this medication.  

There are, otherwise, no real changes to your medications.

We wish you the best of luck and good health!

Your ___ Team
