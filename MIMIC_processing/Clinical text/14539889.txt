STUDIES: 
Abd US (___) 1. In a postcholecystectomy patient common duct 
1 to 1.1 cm may not be abnormal. However, given the patient's 
clinical symptoms the fact that she's had prior pancreatitis 
with similar symptoms and stones in the common duct may require 
MRCP for further evaluation. 

MRCP 
1. ___uct dilatation. Distal 5 x ___uct 
biliary 
calculus is confirmed on this exam. 
2. Prior cholecystectomy. No other abnormality noted. 

ERCP ___
The scout film was normal.
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major 
papilla 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
The sphincterotome was exchanged for a balloon. 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification. The procedure was not difficult.
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
The CBD was 10mm in diameter. 
A filling defect consistent with a stone was identified in the 
CBD.
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were normal. 
The biliary tree was swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting at 
the bifurcation. 
A stone was removed. 
The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones 
were seen. 
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
