___ of Present Illness:
___ woman who works on the ___ lab here for many 
years. Her husband who previously met the prior visit is the 
cardiac anesthesiologists at ___. She presents with a prolonged 
and progressive disorder of bilateral upper extremity 
dysfunction, particularly in the right arm and BLE cramping, 
difficulty walking and balance problems. She has been found to 
have significant stenosis at C4-C5 and C5-C6. At last visit, we 
suggested to continue with conservative care would be safe and 
perhaps effective for her. She was able to undergo a new 
injection with Dr. ___ was helpful regarding her pain, 
but many of her symptoms, particularly neurological symptoms 
have progressed. She explained to me that she has worse 
bilateral lower extremity cramping. This has caused her 
difficulty with walking, including balance difficulties. She has 
also told me that she has difficulty with shower and bathing as 
it is hard for her to do overhead activities such as washing 
her, without significant numbness and tingling being exacerbated 
in her upper extremities. Certain positions and postures of her 
neck have also have given her difficulty. She describes an 
incident where she was in a hot tub, with her neck flexed, 
afterwards had difficulty with walking,feeling that her legs 
were unstable, which persisted for the rest of that day. She 
also has recognized that performing her flexion and extension 
x-rays caused her legs to be shaking, which is a problem, which 
was identified in the past, but now is more severe. Considering 
all these progressive neurological difficulties, she requests 
reconsideration of surgical treatments.
