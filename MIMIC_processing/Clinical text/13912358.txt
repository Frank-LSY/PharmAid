Brief Hospital Course:
The patient arrived to the ___ on high doses of epinephrine
and levophed along with boluses of epinephrine. His SBP on
arrival fluctuated from 40-80. He was given multiple boluses of 
epinephrine, calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate with only 
transient improvements in blood pressure Attempts were made to 
peripherally place ECMO cannulas but this was difficult due to 
the patients body size. The patient became less responsive to 
epinephrine and boluses of epinephrine and developed PEA. CPR 
was initiated. ECMO cannulation was
unsuccessful and the patient had no return of circulation after
15 minutes of CPR and multiple boluses of epinephrine, calcium 
and sodium bicarbonate. The patient expired at 201 on ___.
