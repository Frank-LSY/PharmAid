Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male, who presented with left flank 
pain and symptoms of an obstructing left proximal ureteral stone 
as seen on CT scan from an outside
hospital, which was reviewed by Dr. ___ the ___
residents.  Based on the fact that he had multiple ED visits in 
past four days, urologic intervention was deemed appropriate. He 
was therefore taken to the operative theatre urgently where he 
underwent cystoscopy, left retrograde pyelogram and left 
ureteral stent placement. He tolerated the procedure well and 
recovered in the PACU before transfer to the general surgical 
floor where he remained overnight for observation. See the 
dictated operative note for full details. Overnight, the patient 
was hydrated with intravenous fluids and received appropriate 
perioperative prophylactic antibiotics. At discharge on POD1, 
patients pain was controlled with oral pain medications, 
tolerating regular diet, ambulating without assistance, and 
voiding without difficulty. He did have some persistent sinus 
tachycardia prompting an EKG prior to discharge. Patient was 
explicitly advised to follow up as directed as the indwelling 
ureteral stent must be removed and or exchanged and definitive 
stone management addressed. He was advised to follow with Dr. 
___.

Discharge Instructions:
-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to 
possibly experience some urgency and frequency over the next 
month; this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or, 
if applicable to you, the indwelling ureteral stent. You may 
also experience some pain associated with spasm of your ureter.

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed. 

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds)

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urinethis, as noted above, is expected and will gradually 
improvecontinue to drink plenty of fluids to flush out your 
urinary system

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. 
-You should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any 
medication changes and your post-operative course with your 
primary care doctor.  

-IBUPROFEN (the active ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be 
taken even though you may also be taking ACETAMINOPHEN 
(Tylenol). You may alternate these medications for pain control. 


-For pain control, try TYLENOL FIRST, then the ibuprofen (unless 
otherwise advised), and then take the narcotic pain medication 
(if prescribed) as prescribed if additional pain relief is 
needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)

-You MAY be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM 
that will help with the "burning" pain you may experience when 
voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.

-You may be given prescriptions for a stool softener and/or a 
gentle laxative. These are over-the-counter medications that may 
be health care spending account reimbursable. 

-Docusate sodium (Colace) may have been prescribed to avoid 
post-surgical constipation or constipation related to use of 
narcotic pain medications. Discontinue if loose stool or 
diarrhea develops. Colace is a stool-softener, NOT a laxative.

-Senokot (or any gentle laxative) may have been prescribed to 
further minimize your risk of constipation. 

-Do not eat constipating foods for ___ weeks, drink plenty of 
fluids to keep hydrated

-No vigorous physical activity or sports for 4 weeks.
