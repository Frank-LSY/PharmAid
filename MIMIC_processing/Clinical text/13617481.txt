History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ old right-handed man with a history of 
asthma, prior smoking history, and family history of stroke who 
presents with acute-onset, persistent symptoms of unsteadiness 
lasting all day as well as progressive headache, blurry vision, 
and intermittent sensory loss.

He was last in his normal state of health at 7AM this morning as 
he was getting ready for work. He had the acute onset of 
dizziness, which he describes as "lightheadedness" but seems to
be more instability rather than near syncope. He had difficulty 
donning his uniform, and nearly fell into a chair while trying 
to do so. Sitting down he felt somewhat better, though not back 
to
normal. However, he was able to go to work. However, around 1330 
___ he began to develop headache and worsening instability. At 
___ he started to notice blurry vision. It initially improved
but then returned with worsening headache. At 1630 he felt 
numbness and tingling in his left leg below the knee. He talked 
to his daughter and told her he wanted to go home, but they
encouraged him to go to the emergency department. When they met 
him here, they noticed that he was walking and holding on to the 
walls, which is not typical for him.  

Upon presentation to the ED, his initial NIHSS was 0. He was 
given fluids and a CT/CTA was ordered. This scan showed a new R 
PCA infarct, largely in the medial occipital lobe; as well as
occlusion of the right carotid artery.

Regarding his headache, these are quite unusual for him as he 
does not usually get headches. Otherwise, he denies diplopia, 
dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech.  Denies 
focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias. No bowel or bladder 
incontinence or retention. 
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or 
chills. Jehad a severe cold about a month ago which has 
resolved. No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies 
cough,
shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, 
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. 
 No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

___ Head CTA
1. Focal hypodensity with loss of gray-white differentiation in 
the right 
posterior cerebral artery distribution involving the right 
occipital lobe, 
right inferior medial temporal lobe, compatible with an evolving 
acute 
infarct. 
2. Hypodensity of the right thalamus is identified, which may 
represent 
prominent perivascular space versus sequela of lacunar infarct. 
3. Complete occlusion of the right common carotid artery just 
distal to the 
bifurcation with a tapering configuration, potentially secondary 
to 
dissection. 
4. Otherwise, unremarkable CTA of the head and neck. 

___ Brain MRI/A
1. Study is moderately degraded by motion. 
2. Redemonstration of known right PCA distribution infarcts with 
evidence of 
hemorrhagic transformation, as described. 
3. Redemonstration of complete occlusion of right common and 
cervical internal 
carotid arteries, with flow noted within right supraclinoid 
internal carotid 
artery and distal branches. 
4. Within limits of study, no definite focal dissection 
identified of right 
common or cervical internal carotid artery. 
5. Paranasal sinus disease as described. 

___ NCHCT
1. Hemorrhagic transformation of right temporal occipital 
infarct wild new 
since the CT of ___ is unchanged from the MRI of ___.  The 
area of infarct appears stable in size. 

___ Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF = 70%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion.  

___ CXR
1. Bilateral lower lung interstitial abnormality is of 
indeterminate 
chronicity, but new since ___. If the patient has 
clinical evidence 
pointing to a specific pulmonary problem, consider chest CT for 
further 
evaluation.   
2. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ old right-handed man with a prior 
smoking history and family history of stroke who presented with 
sudden onset of lightheadedness and stepwise worsening of 
symptoms of blurry vision, double vision, lightheadedness and 
headache throughout the day. On initial examination in the ED, 
he has a left homonymous hemianopsia, hypometric saccades on 
leftward gaze, left appendicular ataxia and inability to walk in 
tandem. 

CT/CTA shows a right PCA territory stroke with patent posterior 
circulation as well as a R ICA which is occluded from the common 
carotid to the intracranial portion where it reconstitutes. MRI 
revealed right PCA distribution infarcts with evidence of 
hemorrhagic transformation. Repeat NCHCT 24 hours after 
demonstration of hemorrhagic confirmation showed stability 
without increased hemorrhage. 

The patient was started on Aspirin 81mg Daily for stroke 
prevention. LDL 68. A1C 5.8. TSH normal. Echocardiogram did not 
reveal intracardiac thrombus, EF 70%. He was monitored on 
telemetry without arrhythmia. He will be discharged to home with 
___ of Hearts monitor. 

The etiology of his stroke was not clear. He does have complete 
occlusion with reconstitution of the R common carotid with no 
evidence of dissection (but fat sat sequence not obtained) and 
does have extensive collaterals. Though dissection is on the 
differential, given his bleed he would not be an immediate 
candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation, so 
further imaging was not pursued to classify this during 
admission. 

It is possible, though rare, that he could have a dissection 
near the origin of the common carotid; however, he has no prior 
traumatic history to support this. Collagen vascular disease is 
another consideration, but he has no hypermobile joints, 
hyperextensible skin or valve abnormalities to support this. 
Given a stroke of unknown etiology, he will be discharged with a 
heart monitor to observe for any evidence of a. fib and undergo 
carotid US in ___ weeks as an outpatient. If not revealing, a 
TEE may be considered at that time. Additionally, a 
hypercoaguable work-up was initiated -- with protein C/S, 
antithrombin, beta-2-glycoprotein, cardiolipin ab, and 
antiphosphlipid Ab were pending at the time of discharge. He 
will have prothrombin and factor V Leiden sequencing tested as 
an outpatient. D-dimer pending at the time of discharge which 
will be followed, and if significantly elevated a CT Torso will 
be pursued to evaluate for malignancy.  

He was evaluated by OT who felt his balance was appropriate and 
stable for home. However, given his visual field deficit, he 
cannot drive. 

Of note, his CXR did reveal a lower lung interstitial 
abnormality, and a chest CT can be considered as an outpatient 
by PCP. He had a low grade fever to Tmax 100.5, with repeat UA 
negative, blood culture no growth to date, and CXR negative for 
consolidation. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. He will be continued on daily aspirin 81mg
2. Blood culture no growth to date, final result to be followed 
by PCP. 
3. CXR did reveal a lower lung interstitial abnormality, and a 
chest CT can be considered as an outpatient by PCP. 
4. Carotid US in ___ weeks as an outpatient
5. Hypercoaguable work-up was initiated -- with protein C/S, 
antithrombin, beta-2-glycoprotein, cardiolipin ab, and 
antiphosphlipid Ab were pending at the time of discharge. He 
will have prothrombin and factor V Leiden sequencing tested as 
an outpatient. D-dimer pending at the time of discharge which 
will be followed, and if significantly elevated a CT Torso will 
be pursued to evaluate for malignancy.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of unsteady walking and 
visual changes resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
Prior smoking  
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
Take aspirin 81mg daily
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.  

 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
