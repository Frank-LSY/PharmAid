 - Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please 
follow your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

MEDICATIONS:
   1)  Take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours around the clock. This

   2)  Add oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean 
off this medication in 1 week or sooner.  This is an example on

 Take 1 tablet every 3 hours as needed x 1 day,

 then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days,
