Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Left-sided weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ right-handed female with history of asthma, macular
degeneration and alcoholism who initially presented to ___ 
___
with left sided weakness and was found to have a right MCA 
stroke
with IVE and near complete occlusion of the right internal
carotid artery.

As per the pt, she was walking with her husband on ___ when
she noticed that she had some left-sided weakness as if she was
dragging her foot.  She also states that she had some
intermittent word finding difficulties and would mix up her
words.  On ___ into ___, when she would look out of
her left eye, she would see people and animals, but when she
would look again they were gone.  As per the patient, her 
friends
and family started to notice that she was off not just in her
gait but also that she had a reported right facial droop on
___ evening.  During this time she started to have increased
falls. She reports that on ___ evening she had one episode of
watery diarrhea, which was followed by four episodes of NB, NB
emesis on ___. Given the facial droop, the dragging of her
left leg, and the word confusion, the pt was brought to ___ on ___ where she was found to have a right
MCA stroke.  She was not deemed to be a tPA candidate, so she 
was
started on Plavix given her aspirin allergy.  She was also
started on Atorvastatin 40mg day.  ECHO was completed with no 
PFO
or cardiac embolus.  No Afib was observed while the pt was
inpatient at ___.

Given the near complete occlusion of the right ICA on MRI, a
carotid ultrasound was completed that showed no flow in the 
right
ICA.  To determine whether she would a candidate for possible
surgical intervention, it was suggested that she complete a CTA
head and neck, however the pt reported that she has had an
anaphylactic reaction previously to "dyes" with shortness of
breath, but she is unable to say which dyes.  The OSH was not
able to track down the records from ___ where the 
pt
reports the reaction occurred.  Thus the pt was transferred to
___ for further evaluation by Stroke and Vascular Surgery for
possible vascular intervention.

Of note, while at ___, the CT Chest showed an incidental 0.6
cm right upper lobe nodule, for which she will require follow up
CT chest in ___ months. 

Pt denies any recent illnesses, save the one episode of watery
diarrhea and 4 episodes of NB, NB emesis.  She has not had any
fevers, cough, NC, or headache. No paresthesias, but did report
that earlier in the week her left thumb was numb and that she
attributed it to knitting too much, however then the pt noted
that she had trouble picking up objects with her left hand
including Kleenex.

IMAGING
=======
___ Imaging:
- MRI brain, MRA brain without contrast
IMPRESSION:  Large, subacute infarct within the head of the 
right
caudate nucleus, extending into to the right lentiform nucleus 
by
the right and internal capsule.  Near complete occlusion of the
right internal carotid artery.  Further delineation of this
arterial abnormality could be obtainable with either
gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography or CT angiography of the neck
arterial vasculature.

- MRA neck without contrast:
IMPRESSION: Near-complete occlusion of the right internal 
carotid

- CT head without contrast ___ 
IMPRESSION:*Re-identified are acute infarcts of the right 
caudate, putamen
and anteromedial temporal lobe, with expected evolution since
examination of ___.  There is no evidence of 
hemorrhagic
transformation.
*No evidence of new acute large territory infarct.  Punctate
infarcts of the right parietal lobe are not visualized on CT 
technique.

- Carotid US:  
RIGHT:Comparison MRA shows no flow in the right ICA.  Ultrasound
images showed 2 vessels in the right neck, which are probably
both in the right ECA distribution, have high resistance
waveforms. Contrast-enhanced scan of the neck would be helpful 
in further
evaluation of any residual flow in the ICA. Peak systolic
velocity in the ECA is 132 centimeters/second. Antegrade flow
vertebral artery.
LEFT: The left carotid vasculature has no atherosclerotic 
plaque.
The peak systolic velocity in the left common carotid artery is
90 cm/sec. The peak systolic velocities in the proximal, mid, 
and
distal left internal carotid artery are 87.6, 131, and 79.3
cm/sec, respectively. The peak end diastolic velocity in the 
left
internal carotid artery is 44.8 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 
1.7.
The external carotid artery has peak systolic velocity of 98.5
cm/sec. The vertebral artery is patent with antegrade flow.
IMPRESSION:  Waveform appearance of vessel labeled right ICA on
ultrasound is high resistance, and ___ be ECA branch.  There was
no flow on the neck MRA. Contrast-enhanced MRA, or CTA 
recommended in further evaluation.
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Contrast-enhanced MRA neck, or CTA neck

- ___ MRA Neck W Contrast
1. Absence of flow is re-demonstrated within the right internal 
carotid artery and right middle cerebral artery consistent with 
patient's known infarction.  Stable subtle T1 hyperintensity 
within the cavernous segment of the right ICA ___ be secondary 
to retrograde flow from the contralateral side. 

- ___ MRA Neck WO Contrast
1. Re-demonstrated is complete loss of flow related enhancement 
of the right internal carotid artery, unchanged compared to the 
prior exam likely secondary to occlusion.  On the images with 
fat suppression technique there is no evidence of dissection. 
2. No definite flow was seen within the cervical segments of the 
right 
internal carotid artery on the postcontrast images. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to ___ with symptoms of left-sided 
weakness and was found to have a right MCA stroke with occlusion 
of the right ICA. She was transferred to ___ for possible 
surgical intervention. TTE was normal. She was unable to undergo 
CTA due to a possible remote history of anaphylaxis to contrast 
during an abdominal scan 20+ years ago, but she was premedicated 
and underwent MRA with gadolinium contrast. She tolerated this 
well. The MRA redemonstrated complete occlusion of the artery, 
thus she was not a candidate for surgery. There was no 
dissection. Her strength was essentially at baseline by the time 
of discharge. She was cleared by ___. She was discharged home on 
Plavix (due to aspirin allergy) and atorvastatin.  She will 
follow-up with stroke neurology (Dr. ___ in ___. 

Transitional Issues:
- While at ___, the CT Chest showed an incidental 0.6 cm 
right upper lobe nodule, for which she will require follow up CT 
chest in ___ months.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left-sided weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
- History of smoking
- Alcohol use

We are changing your medications as follows:
- START Plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg DAILY. 
- START Lipitor (atorvastatin) 40mg AT NIGHT. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
