___ 08:09AM BLOOD Calcium-8.4 Phos-3.3 Mg-2.___ year old woman, with prior history of stroke, breast cancer, 
and ?atrial fibrillation who now presents s/p fall. Patient was 
evaluated in the ED for trauma assessment, found to have history 
of melanotic stools and possible coffee ground emesis, and 
admitted for further monitoring. CT head/hip x-rays negative for 
fracture, acute abnormality. CBC on admission normal Hgb of 11.6 
and remained stable, vital stable, and no further episodes of 
melanotic stools. Stool guaiac NEG x2 day of discharge. 
Hemoglobin stable at 11 on discharge. Resumed on Plavix on 
discharge.

# Fall: Patient had traumatic fall in setting of taking a 
shower, and by history did not seem to be syncopal, more likely 
mechanical in nature.  Hip/pelvis x-ray NEG.  Head CT was not 
remarkable for bleed.  No hypotension.  NSR on telemetry.  
Patient reportedly had melanotic stools and 'brown tea' emesis 2 
days PTA (when she fell), though there was no significant anemia 
and guaiac NEG x2 on day of discharge, no concern for GIB in 
setting of ?anticoagulation (patient by report was taking 
pradaxa, though after calling pharmacies it was determined that 
patient is in fact taking Plavix for hx of prior stroke).  No 
pradaxa given during this admission, Plavix restarted at time of 
discharge. 

# Melena/GI bleed: Unclear how significant, however on 
antiplatelet therapy (no pradaxa as above). Patient was not 
significantly anemic, no sign of iron deficiency by MCV.  Hb 
10.5 -> 11 on day of discharge, 11.6 on admission. Guaiac NEG x 
2 on day of discharge.  Patient treated with IV protonix while 
inpatient. 

# Atrial Fibrillation: CHADS2Vasc=5 (age, woman, stroke), had 
been  reportedly maintained on anticoagulation with pradaxa, 
though after speaking with patient's pharmacy it was determined 
to NOT be the case.  No home rate control agents, unclear if 
patient in fact has atrial fibrillation.  No afib on telemetry. 

# Chronic Right MCA stroke: Patient with imaging concerning for 
a chronic MCA right stroke, which correlates with current mild 
left sided weakness.  It was determined that patient in fact 
takes Plavix 75mg PO qd, restarted at time of discharge.  
Continued atorvastatin. 

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin

# Depression: Continued sertraline 100 mg daily

# Candidal Intertrigo of left breast - Gave prescription for 
Miconazole powder.  Concerning given history of breast cancer 
and radiation treatment, possible radiation dermatitis, though 
treatment was many years ago.  Patient instructed to follow-up 
as outpatient with dermatologist.
