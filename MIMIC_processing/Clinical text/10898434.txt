Colonoscopy ___
High residue material throughout. Multiple attempts to irrigate
the colon but the mucosa could not be visualized adequately.
Severe diverticulitis of the whole colon. Large pathology could
not be ruled out due to very poor prep and complex anatomy.

CT Colonography ___
IMPRESSION 
4 cm area of concentric wall thickening in the sigmoid colon on 
a background
of extensive diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 
This area
needs to be evaluated by conventional colonoscopy for potential 
sampling.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Painless hematochezia: likely diverticular bleed. Ddx for lower 
GI bleeding includes colon cancer (though minimal weight loss, 
energy/appetite seem good), ulcers, angiodysplasia, and 
hemorrhoidal bleeding. Unlikely upper bleed given hemodynamic 
stability, normal BUN/Cr ratio, lack of melena. After admission, 
he was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable with stable H/H 
and did not require a transfusion. GI consulted. Colonoscopy on 
___ showing diverticuli but with poor prep so did CT 
colonography on ___. Colonography also shows extensive 
diverticuli and an area in the sigmoid colon with wall 
thickening where a mass cannot be entirely excluded. Discussed 
with GI and felt reasonable to discharge today given the patient 
is clinically well-appearing and no longer bleeding. PCP follow 
up scheduled and GI follow up scheduled in ___. Held 
aspirin during admission given bleeding. Apparently he has a 
history of an old CVA. Left message with PCP to discuss and will 
recommend discussing this with his PCP at his follow up 
appointment.

#Leukocytosis, resolved: likely reactive i/s/o GIB, resolved. No 
localizing sx. No empiric abx.

#T2DM: held home glipizide, metformin; HISS in house

#AS: Had mild AS on echo ___ years ago; does not report any 
recent echo with his PCP; at one point was referred to 
cardiology as outpatient but this was never scheduled; the 
rationale is not clear from talking to patient, perhaps related 
to c/f angina, as
he was complaining of some left arm pain. Does not appear 
recently to have recent TTE. Denies angina, syncope, dyspnea sx. 
Would recommend outpatient echo.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
#Hx CVA: held ASA given bleed - left message with PCP as above 
to discuss

Transitional issues:
- currently holding ASA; discuss with PCP ___ to resume
- outpatient echo

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital with GI bleeding. Your blood 
counts fortunately remained stable and you didn't require a 
transfusion. The GI team consulted and did a colonoscopy, which 
showed extensive diverticuli (pouches in the colon) but given 
there was still stool in the colon, we did another study for a 
better look. This study was a CT colonography. This also showed 
extensive diverticuli. It didn't show a mass. It did show an 
area of wall thickening in the sigmoid colon, which may need to 
be further evaluated in the future. Please follow up with your 
GI appointment to discuss any further workup.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
