History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with PMHx hypertension and question of
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and ovarian cancer who presents status
post mechanical fall with a right-sided weakness. 

Patient was intoxicated after consuming "2 shots of fireball" at
home and fell down a flight of stairs to her basement. She
recalls all the preceding events noticed no palpitations or
presyncope prior to her fall. She has a ___ bulldog which 
she
feels may have impeded her Pap and caused her to fall.  She 
notes
a positive loss of consciousness and recalls awakening with her
fianc√© attempting to give her some water. Initially after the
episode she was able to move her right arm and leg.  Once EMS
arrived she was unable to move her right side and was taken to
___. At the outside hospital CT of her head,
___ and torso were negative for focal findings. She was 
again
noted to have an inability to move her right upper and lower
extremities with decreased sensation in the right lower 
extremity
and was transferred to ___ for principal concern of
spinal injury. 

Of Note, the patient is a cardiac nurse at ___ and
recounts that she has a history of ovarian cancer. She is unable
to recall the laterality of her cancer or its stage or type.  
She
recounts that her ovarian cancer was initially diagnosed ___ years
ago after "3 abnormal Pap smears and a positive H. pylori". Per
the patient, her ovarian cancer was never treated. She had a PET
SCAN at an OSH for "follow up of the ovarian cancer" which
demonstrated non-hodgkins lymphoma on the "left side of my
abdomen". She notes that she sees Dr. ___ at ___ who
prescribes her a "single pill of chemotherapy that she picks up
at the same pharmacy where she gets her metoprolol". Per review
of the patients fill history, there is no other medication 
listed
at this pharmacy.   

Patient was evaluated in the emergency department by ___ surgery
who felt there is nothing acutely the surgical for her.  MRIs of
the head C, T and ___ did not demonstrate any acute
abnormalities.  The patient was seen by neurology who felt that
the patient had right-sided decreased sensation in the right
upper and lower extremities and decreased strength in the right
and lower extremities and felt that the "sensory changes likely
multifactorial and possibly due to brachial and lumbar plexus
injury in the setting of the fall with some embellishment in the
setting of pain, intoxication, and medications".

MICROBIOLOGY:

IMAGING:
___ MR ___ W/O CONTRAST; MR ___ &W/O 
CONTRAST; MR ___ & W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS:  
The study is limited due to lack of axial imaging and 
postcontrast sagittal T1
of the cervical and thoracic spine.
CERVICAL:
A 2 mm posterior subluxation of C6-C7 is seen.  The bone marrow 
signal is
within normal limits.  The visualized posterior fossa and cord 
are
unremarkable.  Cervical spondylosis is seen, including a disc 
bulge at C6-7,
distorting the ventral thecal sac.  No spinal canal narrowing is 
seen.
THORACIC:
The alignment is normal.  The bone marrow signal is within 
normal limits.  The
cord is unremarkable.  No spinal canal or foraminal narrowing is 
seen.
LUMBAR:
Alignment is normal.  The bone marrow signal is within normal 
limits.  There
is no abnormal enhancement.  The cord terminates at T12-L1 and 
is
unremarkable.  Disc bulges and bilateral facet osteophytes are 
seen at L4-5
and L5-S1, causing no spinal narrowing and moderate bilateral 
foraminal
narrowing.
OTHER: The visualized paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited exam due to lack of axial imaging and postcontrast 
sagittal T1 of
the cervical and thoracic spine.
2. The spine cord is unremarkable.  No abnormal enhancement or 
masses.
3. Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine causing 
moderate bilateral
foraminal narrowing at L4-5 and L5-S1.

___ MRI BRAIN
FINDINGS: 
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, 
midline shift
or infarction.   The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber 
and
configuration.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal brain MRI.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=====================================
___ woman with history of HTN, ovarian cancer, and non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma per patient report, who presented after a mechanical 
fall down stairs with + LOC, was found to have R-sided arm and 
leg weakness and sensory changes with normal MRI brain/spine, 
thought to be secondary to conversion disorder. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=====================================

# Mechanical Fall
The patient reported walking down stairs, and then waking up on 
the ground at the bottom of the stairs. No prodromal symptoms, 
thought she may have tripped over her dog. She was evaluated by 
ACS and underwent CT ___ as well as MRI 
___, with no abnormality found. 

# Conversion disorder
The patient was noted to have R arm and leg weakness and lack of 
sensation developing after the fall. As above, brain and spine 
imaging was normal. Her exam showed R-sided ___ strength and 
decreased sensation to all modalities, with no cranial nerve 
abnormalities or pronator drift, and normal reflexes. She did 
have evidence of functional overlay initially with some 
inconsistencies in exam and non-dermatomal pattern of sensation 
loss. She was evaluated by Neurology who felt her exam was most 
consistent with conversion disorder. Her symptoms improved 
during hospitalization. She was seen by ___. At discharge she 
was able to ****. 

# Back pain
The patient complained of diffuse back pain. No evidence of 
vertebral fracture or focal tenderness. She was treated with 
Tylenol, lidocaine patch, ketorolac, and flexeril with a few 
doses of oxycodone for severe pain. She was discharged on 
Tylenol, lidocaine patch, and tizanidine. 

# L-sided abdominal pain 
# Elevated lipase 
Patient initially admitted with elevated lipase to 200s which 
subsequently downtrended, likely in setting of acute alcohol 
intoxication. She also initially had L-sided abdominal pain, 
likely MSK secondary to fall, which subsequently improved. 
Abdominal exam was benign and there was no concern for perf. 

# Positive tox screen
# Alcohol intoxication 
Patient tox screen was positive for alcohol, amphetamines, 
benzos and opiates. ETOH level 92. The patient received fentanyl 
and lorazepam prior to arrival and noted taking Adderall 
recently once. She denied any other recreational drug use. There 
was no evidence of withdrawal during this admission. She was 
seen by Social Work and declined further services.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# ?Ovarian cancer
Patient was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after a PET 
scan and reports being seen in clinic by Dr. ___ at 
___ in ___. She is on an unknown chemotherapy 
regimen. Unable to confirm these diagnoses. 

# HTN
Continued home metoprolol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================================

strength/sensation of R extremities
[] Please ensure follow up with Cognitive Neurology for 
___ of concussion
