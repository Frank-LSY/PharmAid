 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? 
 ==========================

(atrial flutter).

 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL? 
 ============================== 
  You were given medication to help control your heart rate and 
you underwent cardioversion and an ablation procedure to help 
restore a normal heart rhythm.
  There was concern that the pulses in your feet felt weaker 
than they should be, which could mean inadequate blood flow to 
your extremities. You had vascular ultrasound to further 
evaluate this and there were no significant abnormalities based 
on Dr. ___, and he recommends follow up with your 
primary doctor.  

 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME? 
 ================================ 
 - Continue your medications as prescribed.  
 - Continue to follow up with your ___ clinic at ___ 
___. You should have your INR checked at least 
weekly for at least one month following your ablation procedure 
to be sure your INR does not drop too low which would put you at 
high risk for stroke in this time frame. Your INR on ___ was 
3.3.  
 - Please follow up with Dr. ___ your ___ Care Provider 
as listed below  

 It was a pleasure participating in your care.
