History of Present Illness:
___ w celiac p/w FUO. 3 weeks PTA pt was in USOH as a college 
student at ___ when she started having fevers and RLQ pain 
with rectal pain. She returned back to ___ and was seen at an 
OSH on ___. At that time, she had a CT AP w IV contrast which 
showed "Small amount of free fluid in pelvis (which may be 
physiologic. Otherwise no acute findings visualized in the 
abdomen or pelvis." Labs showed WBC 3.4, platelets 147, normal 
diff, normal BMP, normal amylase, lipase, INR 1.2, PTT 21.8. 
___ CBC unremarkable with normal diff, UA w trace leuks, ___ 
epis, few bactereia, ___ WBCs. Pevlic u/s ___ showed small 
endometrial or sub endometrial cysts. She was given APAP 325, 
dexamethasone 4mg, Zofran 4mg, ketorolac 30mg, NS 1L, benadyrl 
25. 
She was discharged with a script for 7d of doxycycline for 
presumed PID, which she took with good effect. A couple weeks 
later, her fevers recurred (this time lower grade to 100) and 
about a week prior to admission she had onset of intermittent HA 
(diffuse, pressure, hours long, no photo/photophobia but some 
neck stiffness) along with intermittent paresthesias of B hands 
(L>R). She has also had perioral numbness at times and numbness 
in her L side of her face. She has had profound fatigue to the 
point of having to lie on the floor. She has had early satiety, 
decreased appetite/craving, nausea without emesis and 5lbs 
weight loss over the last month. She had one night of night 
sweats the night prior to admission, but otherwise none.
She presented to ED at ___ on ___, labs: BMP 
unremarkable, LFTs wnl, CRP 0.6, TSH 4.08, FT4 1.6, WBC wnl with 
26% atypical lymphs, ESR 21, negative FOBT, lyme IgM positive, 
IgG negative, no EIA yet. CXR on ___ clear
KUB ___ unremarkable, UA ___ negative urine dip. 

In the ED, 98.8 82 110/64 16 99%RA. No fevers in ED. Seen by 
neurology who thought likely infectious process with lower 
suspicion for CNS involvement but thought LP would be definitive 
to rule out. Did not tolerate LP upright due to straining 
leading to vasovagal syncope, was able to perform in lateral 
decub. MRV head performed. Results as below. Received lorazepam 
and 1gm APAP. 

She denies syncope (except as above during LP), seizures, 
aphasia, confusion, focal weakness. She denies sore throat but 
had a strange sensation in her throat 1d PTA. she denies URI 
symptoms. Denies CP, SOB, cough. LLQ pain persists and is 
intermittent, not associated with food. Associated with some 
rectal pain not associated with stools. She denies dysuria. LMP 
2 weeks prior to admission, no change in flow (though 1 month 
prior she had a very low flow). 1 week prior to admission she 
noted a rash, which she showed me a picture of. It was 
erythematous, annular plaque with a linear hypopigmentation in 
the middle sparing the nasolabial fold and present on the R side 
of her face only. That resolved but she still has some erythema 
on her face. Recently had an episode where her fingernail beds 
turned blue (not her fingers and no whiteness/redness of 
either). No other rashes. No oral/vaginal/ocular ulcers. No tick 
bites, recent travel. Doesn't spend much time outdoors/around 
woods. No sick contacts though her father who is on Humira for 
ankylosing spondylitis was recently evaluated for chronic cough 
and was found to have latent but not active TB (after seeing 
pulmonary at ___ and has been started on rifampin for ppx. 
Also of note, mother has RA and ___. 

12 systems ROS otherwise negative except as above.

IMAGING
===========
Final Report 
EXAMINATION:  MRV HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___ MR HEAD 
  
INDICATION:  ___ year old woman on OCP with progressive 
parasthesias, malaise, low grade fevers, headache  // eval ? 
venous sinus thrombosis 
  
TECHNIQUE:  3D phase-contrast MRV of the head was obtained. 
Sagittal T1 
weighted imaging was performed. Three dimensional maximum 
intensity projection and segmented images of the MRV were then 
generated. This report is based on interpretation of all of 
these images. 
  
COMPARISON:  None. 
  
FINDINGS:  
MRV: Normal flow signal is demonstrated within the superior 
sagittal sinus, straight sinus, and sigmoid dural sinuses.  
There is asymmetric diminutive appearance of the left transverse 
sinus are with presence of flow related enhancement, likely a 
congenital variant.  The jugular bulbs and proximal jugular 
veins are patent. Evaluation of the deep venous systems reveals 
normal flow signal in the internal cerebral veins. The vein of 
___ is also unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis.  Asymmetric 
diminutive 
appearance of the left transverse sinus, likely a developmental 
variant. 

CT CHEST W CONTRAST:
FINDINGS:  
No incidental thyroid findings.  No supraclavicular, 
infraclavicular or 
axillary lymphadenopathy.  However, lymph nodes in both the left 
and the right axillary region (5, 15) are borderline in size.  
Thymic remnant (5, 16).  No vascular abnormalities.  No 
incidental pulmonary embolism.  Normal appearance of the heart.  
No pericardial effusion.  The posterior mediastinum is also 
normal.  Upper abdominal findings are described in detail in the 
dedicated abdominal CT report.  No osteolytic lesions at the 
level of the ribs, the sternum, or the vertebral bodies.  The 
airways are patent.  No pleural thickening, no pleural 
effusions.  No diffuse lung disease.  No evidence of pneumonia.  
No suspicious lung nodules or masses. 

IMPRESSION:  
Borderline sized left and right axillary lymph nodes.  No 
ymphadenopathy.  No infectious or neoplastic changes of the lung 
parenchyma. 

CT ABD/PELVIS W IV/PO CONTRAST:
LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. 
There is no 
evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. 
  
ABDOMEN: 
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates heterogeneous attenuation 
throughout, which may represent steatosis or underlying diffuse 
liver disease.  Recommend repeating LFTs.  There is no evidence 
of focal lesions.  There is no evidence of intrahepatic or 
extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is within 
normal limits. 
  
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal 
dilatation.  There is no peripancreatic stranding. 
  
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without 
evidence of focal lesions. 
  
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape. 
  
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram.  There is no evidence of focal renal lesions 
or hydronephrosis.  There is no perinephric abnormality. 
  
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and 
enhancement throughout.  The colon and rectum are within normal 
limits.  The appendix is normal. 
  
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
 There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. 
  
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus is anteverted.  No concerning 
adnexal lesions are detected. 
  
LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  No 
atherosclerotic disease is noted. 
  
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture. 
  
SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Heterogeneous appearance of the liver parenchyma may be due 
to contrast 
bolus timing, however, underlying diffuse liver disease such as 
steatosis, or an  inflammatory process such as hepatitis, could 
be considered.  No focal hepatic mass.  Comparison with LFTs 
recommended. 
2. Small amount of intrapelvic free fluid.  No focal fluid 
collections. 
3. No CT findings correlating with the reported history of left 
lower quadrant pain. 

MRI BRAIN WITH IV CONTRAST
EXAMINATION:  MR HEAD W AND W/O CONTRAST T9112 MR HEAD. 
  
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, masses, 
mass effect, midline shift or infarction.   The ventricles and 
sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.  There is no 
abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.  There is no 
abnormal focus of slowed diffusion.  The principal intracranial 
vascular flow voids are preserved.  The dural venous sinuses are 
patent on MPRAGE images.  Note is made of a right frontal 
developmental venous anomaly (images ___, series 10, and image 
144, series 9). 
  
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are 
clear.  The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Right frontal developmental venous anomaly.  Otherwise 
essentially normal 
contrast-enhanced MR of the head.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you. You were admitted for fever 
and headache. We are still not sure what is causing this but we 
have thankfully ruled out many of the most concerning 
possibilities. At this time, we think it is possible you have 
mononucleosis, but there are a number of studies pending. You 
should follow up with infectious disease as below this week and 
then with rheumatology (to work up the possibility of a 
rheumatologic problem) and gastroenterology (to consider a 
colonoscopy) as discussed. Please follow up the remaining 
pending labs with your primary care doctor and with infectious 
disease at your appointment. 
We wish you the best in your recovery!
