Imaging:
___
Noncontrast head CT: The patient is status post right temporal 
craniotomy.  
The adjacent hypodensities likely represent chronic post 
surgical encephalomalacia, however there are no priors for 
comparison. There is no 
evidence of hemorrhage. The ventricles are normal in size and 
appearance. 
  
CTA: The right internal carotid artery and the right A1 are 
diminutive in 
size. The right proximal M1 is also diminutive, and the distal 
M1 segment is not visualized. The patient is status post right 
MCA bypass. Although the bypass is not definitively visualized, 
there is patent parenchymal vasculature in this area. It is 
unclear whether the vasculature is being supplied from 
leptomeningeal collaterals or from the bypass. 

MRI: 
1. No acute infarct. 
2. Decreased caliber of the right internal carotid artery and 
decreased 
visualization of the branch vessels, consistent with history of 
___ 
disease and better evaluated on the prior CTA. 

___
Carotid/cerebral bilateral angiogram: 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Right-sided severe of ___ disease. Functioning STA 
bypass graft.  
Extensive collateralization from the graft, and anterior 
cerebral artery which is patent supplied by the left side 
anterior communicating artery, and right posterior cerebral 
artery. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with a history of 
migraine headaches, ___ syndrome s/p R ECIC bypass ___, 
and cervical disc disease who presents to the ED with 5 days of 
left arm and leg paresthesias, left leg heaviness and mild left 
eye drooping. Her initial exam notable for subtle left 
hemiparesis and slight left ptosis. She has subjective sensory 
deficit as well. She was imaged with CT/CTA/MRI there was no 
evidence of acute stroke. Neurosurgery consulted for angiogram 
which showed (per op report) "right-sided severe of moyamoya 
disease. Functioning STA bypass graft. Extensive 
collateralization from the graft, and anterior cerebral artery 
which is patent supplied by the left side anterior communicating 
artery, and right posterior cerebral artery." We also considered 
obtaining extended routine EEG to assess for seizures, though 
patient did have unrevealing EEG in the past. Given paresthesias 
only and patient stable with otherwise reassuring examination, 
she may obtain this as an outpatient. 

She had a chest X-ray as part of pre-angiogram evaluation. This 
showed a chain suture in the left upper lobe (indicating prior 
surgery) but also showed the suggestion of a 10 mm soft tissue 
nodule in the region. Radiology suggested chest CT to further 
evaluate. This may be obtained as an outpatient. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. Continue home aspirin, remaining home medications
2. Follow up with Neurology and PCP
3. Consider extended routine EEG as an outpatient
4. Obtain chest CT to further evaluate possible 10 mm left upper 
lobe soft tissue nodule seen on chest X-ray

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You were admitted to the neurology service with symptoms of left 
sided tingling concerning for an acute stroke. You were imaged 
with CT/CTA/MRI which did not show evidence of acute stroke. We 
have consulted neurosurgery to perform an angiogram which 
assessed blood flow through your bypass. This study showed 
evidence of your known ___ syndrome on the right as well as 
an open (functioning) blood vessel graft. Neurosurgery did not 
recommend any surgeries. You were continued on your home 
aspirin. You should follow up with your neurologist and your 
primary care physician and take your medications as prescribed. 
Your neurologist may consider getting an EEG (another brain wave 
test which you have had in the past) if you continue to have 
tingling episodes. If you have worsening symptoms, any new or 
concerning symptoms, please seek additional medical attention.

You did have an area of possible abnormality seen on your chest 
X-ray. You should have a chest CT to better evaluate this as an 
outpatient. Your primary care physician can help you arrange 
this. 

It was a pleasure caring for you. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Stroke Team
