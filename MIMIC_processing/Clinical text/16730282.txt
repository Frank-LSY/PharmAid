Imaging
=========================
RUQ US ___

IMPRESSION: 
1. Cholelithiasis with dilatation of the common bile duct up to 
1.3 cm.  
Although no CBD stone was seen, this may suggest 
choledocholithiasis.  
ERCP/MRCP may be obtained for further evaluation. 
2. No evidence of acute cholecystitis. 
3. Hypoechoic pancreas may suggest edema in the setting of 
pancreatitis. 
4. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease and more advanced liver disease including 
steatohepatitis or significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on this study. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Radiological evidence of fatty liver does 
not exclude 
cirrhosis or significant liver fibrosis which could be further 
evaluated by ___. This can be requested via the Liver 
Center (FibroScan) or the Radiology Department with either MR 
___ or US ___, in conjunction with a 
GI/Hepatology consultation" * 

MRCP ___
IMPRESSION:  
1.  choledocholithiasis with the largest calculi measuring 4 mm 
in diameter present in the distal CBD resulting in extra and 
mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. Gallstones but no 
features of cholecystitis. 
  
Severe hepatic steatosis. 
  
Mild bronchial impaction noted in the left lower lobe which is 
nonspecific and could be better characterized with chest CT if 
clinically indicated. 

ERCP ___:
Successful ERCP with sphincetorotomy and extraction of stone 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of anxiety, depression, ADHD, GERD, obesity 
presenting with gallstone pancreatitis. Constellation of 
epigastric pain, elevated LFTs in a cholestatic pattern, dilated 
CBD, and pancreatitis together are diagnostic of gallstone 
pancreatitis. Patient had MRCP which showed small retained stone 
and underwent ERCP on ___ with stone removal. ACS was consulted 
for CCY. The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 
which went well without complication (reader referred to the 
Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in 
the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor tolerating liquids, 
on IV fluids, and oral analgesia for pain control.  The patient 
was hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. Your 
liver function tests were elevated, indicating that a gallstone 
was causing a blockage in your common bile duct, causing a 
gallstone pancreatitis. You underwent an ERCP procedure in which 
your bile ducts were cleared and the stone was removed.  You 
were then taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
