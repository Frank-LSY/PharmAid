Brief Hospital Course:
Bilateral foot surgery was performed on ___.  Initially 
postoperatively patient was doing well minimal pain bilaterally. 
 Approximately 4 hours postoperatively she developed began 
developing severe pain to the right foot.  She unfortunately was 
also nauseous and vomiting at the time.  Any oral medication 
that was attempted was unfortunately purged.  The PACU nurse did 
not feel comfortable with the patient being discharged home.  
Patient was evaluated in the postanesthesia care unit with 
anesthesia present approximately 8 hours postoperatively.  
Together we agreed patient would undergo a regional block to the 
right lower extremity and that she would be admitted for pain 
control.  Patient was subsequently admitted to the floor with 
vital signs stable.  Overnight patient's pain was controlled 
with oral medications.  Her vitals remained stable.  Upon 
admission patient stated she was no longer taking any 
antihypertensive medications.  Her blood pressure was 
consistently in the 150s over ___, and felt comfortable.  
Patient did well overnight with her oral pain regimen.  Given 
her regional block, her right lower extremity weightbearing 
status was slightly restricted, given this, physical therapy was 
consulted.  Patient did well with physical therapy and was 
cleared to return home with the use of a walker.  Once a 
regional block wears off she may be weightbearing as tolerated 
in surgical shoes bilaterally. 

Given her positive response to her oral pain regimen overnight
With ice and elevation patient stated she felt ready to return 
home with the understanding that she will still have some 
baseline pain for the next few days but should improve daily.  
On discharge vitals again were stable with BP in a similar range 
and appears baseline for her.  Patient stated she plan to see 
her PCP within the next 2 weeks.  Patient is also scheduled to 
follow-up with podiatry in the next week.  Given clearance from 
physical therapy and good pain control with oral medications 
patient was deemed stable for discharge.
