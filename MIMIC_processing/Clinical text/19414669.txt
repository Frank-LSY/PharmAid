throughout. Sways with Romberg, even if base is wide.
 - REFLEXES: Symmetric throughout the arms, absent legs.
 - CEREBELLAR: No ataxia seen on FNF, mirroring. No checked
reflexes. Left heel to shin seemed slightly clumsy. Base is
obviously wide upon standing. No Unterberger.

___ Head/Neck CT/A  
1. Normal head and neck CTA. 
2. Top-normal main pulmonary artery which can be seen with 
chronic pulmonary 
hypertension. 

___ Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: No ASD or PFO seen. Normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.  

___ Brain MRI
. No acute intracranial abnormality. Unremarkable brain MRI.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the neurology service to rule out a 
posterior circulation stroke. During admission, her exam 
significantly improved with minimal square wave jerks, no 
nystagmus and no other cerebellar signs. The vertigo resolved. 
Overall her picture was deemed to be compatible with peripheral 
vertigo.

MRI brain normal. Echo revealed normal function with no PFO. 

LDL 90. A1C 8. TSH pending. She was started on ASA 81mg and 
atorvastatin during admission given initial concern for stroke, 
but these were discontinued prior to discharge.

She was seen by ___ for diabetes management and will be 
discharged to ___ appt. She was continued on ___ dose 
Humalog ___ 13 units in the AM and 20 units in the ___ and 
metformin was held. Her regimen will be adjusted appropriately 
at ___ this afternoon. 

She will be discharged to home with home ___ given some imbalance 
with walking, though independent. 

Overall, it was thought that her vertigo may be secondary to a 
peripheral process such as BPPV or Meniere's. If she has 
recurrent episodes, she should discuss with neurology.

1. TSH pending, follow-up by PCP
2. ___ to adjust DM regimen at outpatient visit today
