___ Colonoscopy:
 Endoscopic mucosal resection: a single sessile 4 cm polyp of 
benign appearance was found in the cecum. The polyp was raised 
by submucosal injection with D5W and methylene blue to create a 
saline pillow. An endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was 
performed and the polyp was completely removed in piecemeal 
fashion using a hot snare. The polypectomy base and edges were 
treated with APC. Three endoclips were successfully applied for 
the purpose of tissue positioning with loop placement for 
traction exposure.  (mucosal resection, endoclip)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
 

___ Colonoscopy:
Impression: The cecal EMR site was identified: this is 
potential source of GI blood loss. 
___ areas of clots and visible vessels were visualized 
with no active bleeding. 
___ was some dark maroon coloured blood in the rectum, 
however dark brown contents in remaining stomach 3 cc.
___ ___ injection was applied for hemostasis 
with success.
___ Two endoclips were successfully applied for the purpose 
of hemostasis.
