History of Present Illness:
HPI from ED consult note dated ___ by Dr. ___:

___ is a ___ yo F college student at ___ who
was sent to the ED on a section by her outpatient psychiatrist
after she reported to him taking twenty 50 mg zoloft tablets and
one 2.5 mg tablet of Olanzapine. In the ED, she was given IV
fluids and observed, found by toxicology consult to have mild
serotonin syndrome. 

Pt reports "not doing well lately." She describes a month of
escalating anxiety, inability to eat food without vomiting,
depressive symptoms and urges to cut herself. Pt reports missing
classes because "she could not get out of bed" and estimating a
3.5 GPA, which is lower than what she thinks she can achieve.
Yesterday, she reports waking up and thinking "I don't want to
live anymore." She tried to distract herself from these thoughts
by spending time with friends. She went to worship night at a
church she attends. At church, she prayed and reports "hearing
God tell me 'I know you want to die tonight but I won't let
you.'" She was supposed to go to a friend's place, but decided 
to
go home instead, where she knew she would be alone. She thought
"I should just take all my medications." She took all of her
remaining Zoloft and Olanzapine and got into bed. After taking
the pills, she got a phone call from a friend but did not tell
the friend what she had done. She states she had looked up how 
to
overdose on Zoloft online and had seen that she likely did not
have enough medication to kill herself, "but it was what I had
and I was being impulsive." She remembers thinking that if she
woke up tomorrow she would go to her psychiatrist in the morning
and tell him what had happened. 

When asked if she regrets taking the pills, she states she feels
guilty for making her friends sad, and she knows her friends
would be even more upset if she did kill herself. She states "I
feel like I made a huge mess and now I have to figure out how to
put my life back together. She states she thinks she still has
potential "to live a really productive life if my brain wasn't
this way all the time." Pt states she has been open with friends
about how poorly she has been doing and has been spending each
night with a different friend, but states she is starting to 
feel
like a burden. She did not share with anyone that she had been
having suicidal thoughts. 

Pt reports a prior overdose at age ___ (took promethazine
codeine)after the death of her friend. She states she spent 
three
days in an inpatient unit and was required to see a therapist 
for
several months after that, but did not find this helpful because
"most of what I was responding to was situational and the
therapist couldn't help with that." Pt reports cutting while in
middle school.

After being started on Zoloft 1.5 weeks ago, pt reports an
episode of "Feels like I am on top of the world, talking fast,
pacing and having thoughts are rushing through my brain." Pt
reports her psychiatrist told her to stop taking zoloft and gave
her several days of olanzapine after she presented to an
appointment one week ago in this state. She reports the state
lasted "one or two days." Pt reports previous similar epsiodes
throughout her life, but does not think they lasted more than a
day each time

Pt reports lack of energy, low mood, hopelessness, low self
esteem,  tearfulness, apathy, decreased appetite, and increased
sleep, anxiety with nausea 

COLLATERAL

Pt presented to schedule appointment this morning and told him
she took a three week supply of Zoloft and one Olanzapine. She

her
1.5 weeks ago when she presented for anxiety and he started her
on Zoloft. Last week, she presented with symptoms concerning for
mania (pacing back and forth in the room, reporting racing
thoughts) and so he discontinued the Zoloft and gave her two
doses of 2.5 mg Olanzapine. When she presented this morning, he
became concerned for her safety and sent her to the ED on a
section. He states pt is  amenable to inpatient stay, which he
recommends.
 
He reports the patient also has an active eating disorder and he
does not think she has been eating very much."

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course (Part of discharge summary)

1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout her admission.  She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#)  BPAD, current mixed episode vs. characterological mood 
instability
Upon presenting to the unit patient exhibited a bright affect 
and linear thought process w/o perceptual disturbance or other 
thought disorder. Subsequently her affect changed to dysthymic 
though reactive, and her stated mood was "muted." After 
discussion with patient's outpatient psychiatrist Dr. ___ 
confirmed ___ report of Zoloft trial inducing hypomania 
including impulsivity, hypersexual dressing, not sleeping), 
treatment team increasingly suspected a mixed episode of BPAD 
and began a trial of Seroquel 75mg PO QHS for mood stabilization 
with added nighttime sedating properties, as patient also 
endorsed nighttime flashbacks to past sexual traumas. 
Subsequently patient's affect changed to euphoric w/ laughing 
and smiling uncontrollably, pacing the halls, mood was "on top 
of the world." Pt denied experiencing internal restlessness c/w 
akathisia. Tx team felt her presentation may be c/w mixed 
episode of BPAD; indeed, pt described her experience during this 
hypomania as similar to what she experienced in Dr. ___ 
___ after starting Zoloft. She describes having had these 
euphoric periods in the past for several days at a time followed 
by several days of struggling to get out of bed. An alternative 
explanation for patient's hypomanic-appearing presentation is 
that this is simply a reflection of ___ personality and 
developmental stage (in particular, reflecting possible 
executive dyscontrol). ___ history and presentation were 
ultimately deemed to be suggestive of, but not conclusive for, 
Bipolar Affective Disorder. However, ___ team chose to treat 
empirically with mood stabilizer Seroquel and monitor for sx 
response. By day of discharge, after slowly increasing Seroquel 
dose to 75mg qhs, ___ affect returned to ___ w/o thought 
disorder or perceptual disturbance.

After continued conversation w OP psychiatrist Dr. ___ 
team considered replacing Seroquel with Lamictal (and additional 
Abilify as a bridge until Lamictal levels therapeutic); there 
was concern for weight gain properties of Seroquel. Pt reported 
a remote hx of SJS reaction to Bactrim, so ___ team reached out 
to Dermatology, who ultimately had no comment on whether pt was 
at increased risk for SJS if started on Lamictal. Consequently, 
pt was not started on Lamictal/Abilify. Her Seroquel was 
increased to 100mg QHS by day of discharge with no immediate 
evidence of adverse side effects. 

Patient was evaluated by the ___ Violence Prevention 
after disclosing to ___ team about multiple sexual traumas within 
the last year. They, pt and ___ team worked to find a trauma 
focused outpatient therapist for after discharge. Pt was 
scheduled for an intake appointment at ___ 
Partial ___ Program on ___. Dr, ___ met with pt on ___ 
and she was entirely nonsuicidal; noted much improved by 
multiple staff.

Patient maintained good behavioral control throughout admission.

#) Unspecified Eating Disorder
Patient maintained good PO intake and stable daily weights while 
admitted without evidence of purging or restricting behavior.

#) Unspecified Anxiety Disorder
Pt endorsed a hx of panic attacks in childhood and adolescence. 
Given current presentation ___ team is concerned that these may 
have in fact represented undetected hypomanic/manic episodes. 

#) Recent hx of sexual trauma
Pt reported 2 incidents of sexual trauma in the last year. The 
___ Violence Prevention was consulted and evaluated pt, 
endorsing ___ team plan of coordinating trauma based therapy in 
the outpatient setting. Pt was arranged for an intake 
appointment at ___ Program on 
___ at 8:30am. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Pt denied hx of substance use disorders. Endorsed occasional 
marijuana and alcohol use and received counseling on the 
importance of sobriety especially in the setting of psychiatric 
illness.  

4. MEDICAL
#) Pt complained of "a monthslong period" after recent IUD 
placement. Pt was encouraged to follow up with her PCP ___ 
___ at her next appointment (scheduled for pt by ___ team). We 
recommend that Primary Care team follow up with regular A1c and 
weight monitoring given new Seroquel regimen.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. Patient was supportive and 
sociable on the milieu.

#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Per ___ Deac 4 Resident Accept Note: 

'Dr. ___, ___
Pt presented to schedule appointment this morning and told him
she took a three week supply of Zoloft and one Olanzapine. She
was tremulous but had no other obvious symptoms. He first saw 
her
1.5 weeks ago when she presented for anxiety and he started her
on Zoloft. Last week, she presented with symptoms concerning for
mania (pacing back and forth in the room, reporting racing
thoughts) and so he discontinued the Zoloft and gave her two
doses of 2.5 mg Olanzapine. When she presented this morning, he
became concerned for her safety and sent her to the ED on a
section. He states pt is  amenable to inpatient stay, which he
recommends.
 
He reports the patient also has an active eating disorder and he
does not think she has been eating very much."'

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Lorazepam 0.5mg q8h PRN anxiety/insomnia, 
Seroquel 100mg PO QHS
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Dr. ___, ___ 
___ Women's Partial Hospital Program, therapy referrals for ___ 
___ when pt moves there in ___.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Seroquel, including weight gain/metabolic syndrome and 
rare EPS, and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, 
including not taking the medication, with this patient.   We 
discussed the patient's right to decide whether to take this 
medication as well as the importance of the patient's actively 
participating in the treatment and discussing any questions 
about medications with the treatment team.  The patient appeared 
able to understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS

On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon recent suicide 
attempt by overdose and past history of intentional overdose on 
codeine at age ___.  Her static factors noted at that time 
include history of suicide attempts, history of abuse, age, 
single status.  The modifiable risk factors were also addressed 
at that time, and include suicidal ideation with intent/plan, 
hopelessness, recklessness, limited social supports, limited 
coping skills, impulsivity, polarized thinking, and recent 
relationship loss. These were addressed with Occupational 
Therapy Coping Skills groups, social work intervention to 
arrange outpatient therapy, Violence Prevention Group 
involvement to coordinate outpatient trauma-focused treatment. 
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, 
reality testing ability, good problem-solving skills, positive 
therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, no history 
of substance use disorder.  Thus, I feel the patient does not 
meet section 12a criteria for risk of harm to self/others. 
Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness.
