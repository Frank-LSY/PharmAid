Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Lumbar disc herniation
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LEFT L5-S1 MICRODISCECTOMY

 
History of Present Illness:
A very pleasant ___ female who is having less back pain
now.  Her main complaint right now is pain over the left hip
area, radiating to what seems to be L5 distribution on the left. 

That is miserable and unbearable sometimes.  She also has SI
joint pain on the left.  Range of motion of the hip is eliciting
mild pain.  In the past, she had SI joint injections that did 
not
help very much from what she states.  The flexion/extension
x-rays she had done in her prior visit with us were reviewed and
it showed movement between L5-S1, which is borderline normal at 
2
mm.  I had a long discussion with her.  I reexamined her and she
does not have any weakness except positive SLR for L5
radiculopathy.  She says that the pain at the L5 when it comes 
is
really disabling on the left.  I reviewed the new MRI of her
lumbar spine, and it shows worsening far lateral left L5-S1 disc
herniation, which is clearly affecting the L5 nerve root.  That
is responsible for her radiculopathy at L5.  I discussed with 
her
possible fusion L4 to S1 through laminectomies and
decompressions.  However, her back pain is minimal now.  I think
it is reasonable to try a far lateral left L5-S1 microdiscectomy
since she is having almost minimal back pain.  Risks and 
benefits
were discussed and she knows that we may need to have a fusion 
in
the future.

Pertinent Results:
Please see OMR for all lab and imaging results.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented to the pre-op area, was evaluated by 
anesthesia and taken to the OR for elective L5-S1 
microdiscectomy. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Please 
refer to formal op report in OMR for further 
surgical/intra-operative details. Patient was extubated in the 
OR following some difficulty waking, and taken to the PACU in 
stable condition. She was subsequently admitted to the 
neurosurgery service. On POD 1 she was determined to be 
ambulating well, pain controlled with medication, and ready for 
discharge in good condition.
