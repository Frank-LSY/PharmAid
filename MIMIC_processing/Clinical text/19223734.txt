IMAGING/DIAGNOSTICS:
====================
___ Cardiac catheterization:
Impressions:
1. Mild coronary atherosclerosis without angiographically 
apparent high grade flow-limiting epicardial
disease, but diffuse slow, pulsatile flow consistent with 
microvascular dysfunction.
2. Normal left ventricular end diastolic pressure.
3. Frequent atrial and ventricular ectopy.

Recommendations:
1. Routine post-TR Band care.
2. Reinforce primary preventative measures against CAD.
3. Additional plans per the ___ and Cardiac Surgery 
Services.

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION: 
Lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pleural 
effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen

___ CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild fusiform dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta 
measuring up to
4.1 cm.  No significant aortic valvular calcification.
2. Reticulation and micronodularity at the bilateral lung bases 
is
nonspecific, but can be seen in inflammatory or infectious 
conditions, such as
bronchiolitis.
3. Several pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm.  No CT 
follow-up is
recommended low risk patient, with an optional CT recommended in 
12 months for
high-risk patients.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  For incidentally detected single solid 
pulmonary nodule
smaller than 6 mm, no CT follow-up is recommended in a low-risk 
patient, and
an optional CT in 12 months is recommend in a high-risk patient.

___ ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF =65%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid 
(right/left fusion with raphe). At least moderate (2+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. There is minimal diastolic flow reversal 
in the distal aortic arch indicating this is not severe aortic 
regrugtation. The pressure half time and lack of left 
ventricular dilation (assuming this is chronic aortic 
regurgitation) argue against more significant disease as well, 
but given the eccentric jet this could be underestimated if 
there were an acute change in the aortic regurgitation severity. 
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: At least moderate aortic regurgitation with bicuspid 
aortic valve (right left fusion). Mild aortopathy. Severity can 
be better clarified with TEE. I will ask Dr. ___ to review 
the TTE images as he is the TEE attending tomorrow. If on second 
review the aortic regurgitation is felt to be at least moderate 
to severe then TEE can be deferred.

___ CTA Head and Neck:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. No evidence of dissection, aneurysm or occlusion of the head 
and neck.  No significant ICA stenosis by NASCET criteria.

___ MR Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. A few scattered white matter FLAIR hyperintensities are 
nonspecific.

___ MR Cardiac:
IMPRESSION:
Please note that this report only pertains to extracardiac 
findings.
There are no significant extrathoracic findings.

___ STRESS:
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with h/o HTN, mild CAD, 
moderate AR with bicuspid aortic valave was referred to the lab 
for evaluation of exercise induced arrhythmia. He exercised for 
14 minutes on Gervino protocol and stopped for fatigue. That 
represents an average exercise tolerance for his age with 7.3 
METs. No chest, arm, neck or back discomfort reported. The 
patient presented to the lab with mild dizziness which did not 
change throughout the test. No significant ST segment changes 
noticed. Rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated APBs, 
occasional isolated VPBs, rare atrial and ventricular couplets, 
rare atrial triplet and ___ betas run of narrow complex PSVT at 
12.5 minute during
   
___ MR ___ spine:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Appearance of C5-C6 is most likely degenerative.  Absence of 
paravertebral edema argues against infection, clinically 
correlate. 
2. Degenerative changes cervical spine. 
3. Moderate central canal narrowing C5-C6. 
4. Multilevel significant foraminal narrowing, as above. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with PMHx HTN, severe aortic regurgitation 
presenting with worsening lightheadedness, SOB, and chest pain 
consistent with acute decompensated heart failure.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Bicuspid aortic valve
# Severe aortic regurgitation
Patient presented with worsening shortness of breath with 
minimal exertion as well as worsening dizziness on admission 
that was initially concerning for heart failure; however, there 
was no evidence of volume overload on exam. At the OSH, he had 
an echo that was read as "severe aortic regurgitation" and there 
was concern that his symptoms were caused by insufficient 
perfusion in the setting of his aortic regurgitation. An ECG was 
done which showed no ST changes and troponins were negative. The 
patient had a diagnostic cardiac cath that showed no major 
coronary artery disease. He had a repeat TTE that showed EF 65% 
and moderate aortic regurgitation. Cardiac surgery was consulted 
and recommended cardiac MRI for further characterization, read 
was pending at time of discharge. Ulitmately, it was decided 
that the patient did not require valve replacement. The 
patient's home metoprolol and lisinopril were held during 
admission. He will follow-up in Cardiology clinic going forward. 


# Dizziness
Following his cardiac work-up (see above), Neurology was 
consulted for the patient's ongoing dizziness with exertion and 
recommended CTA head and neck which were negative for acute 
pathologies. They also recommended MRI C-spine which showed no 
acute pathology. They recommended an ophthalmology evaluation 
for a dilated eye exam, which showed no acute pathology. 
Neurology signed off on day of discharge. The patient's 
dizziness had improved on day of discharge, but the etiology 
remained unclear. He will follow up with cardiology and if his 
symptoms persist, can discuss referral to Mass Eye and Ear for 
further evaluation. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Hypertension 
Held home anti-hypertensives as patient's blood pressures were 
borderline low during admission. Recommended to patient that he 
should check his BP 2x/day and bring BP log to follow-up 
appointment with cardiology. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================
[ ] New medications: Aspirin 81mg PO daily, Atorvastatin 40mg PO 
qpm
[ ] Held medications: Metoprolol tartrate 25mg PO daily, 
Lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily, please restart in the outpatient 
setting as appropriate
[ ] Patient should follow up with cardiology and at this 
appointment can discuss whether he requires a referral to Mass 
Eye and Ear for further evaluation of his dizziness 
[ ] Patient had several pulmonary nodules incidentally detected 
on CT of the Chest. All nodules were <5mm. No CT follow-up is 
recommended low risk patient, with an optional CT recommended in 
12 months for high-risk patients. 
[] Please follow-up pending studies at discharge: blood 
cultures, MMA level and final Cardiac MRI read.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

Why were you admitted to the hospital? 
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
worsening shortness of breath and dizziness.

What was done for you in the hospital? 
- You had a procedure called a cardiac catheterization to 
evaluate the vessels of your heart, and it showed that you had 
mild disease in your vessels that did not require intervention. 
- You had an ultrasound of your heart which showed moderate 
backward flow through your aortic valve.
- The cardiac surgeons were consulted and recommended getting an 
image of your heart called a cardiac MRI - this result was 
pending at discharge.
- The neurologists were consulted and recommended getting 
imaging of your brain to see if there was an abnormality that 
was causing your dizziness. The imaging was reassuring and did 
not show a cause to your dizziness. 
- The ophthalmologists were consulted for a thorough exam of 
your eyes and felt this was normal.

What should you do when you go home?
- You should continue taking your mediations as prescribed. Your 
new medications are Atorvastatin 40mg daily and aspirin 81mg 
daily. You should stop metoprolol and lisinopril for now until 
you see your Cardiologist in the outpatient clinic.
- You should follow up with your primary care physician and 
cardiologist.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
