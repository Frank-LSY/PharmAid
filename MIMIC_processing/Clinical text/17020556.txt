History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ yo right handed woman with no 
significant
PMH who presents after awakening this morning at 4am with 
vertigo
and double vision. The vertigo is described as a rocking
sensation. She has never had vertigo before. It has improved 
some
over the course of the day but persists. The vertigo is worse
when lying down. It improves some with patching the eye. She was
veering left and right, this morning while walking and used the
wall to help steady herself. She has been nauseated today. She
noticed later when she looked in the mirror that her right eye 
is
exodeviated and her gaze is dysconjugate. She endorses a mild
headache. It is frontal, dull, constant, and exacerbated by
unpatching her right eye. She gets headaches occasionally at
baseline. This headache began today and is not as severe (___)
as some of her previous headaches. She denies recent infection,
neck pain, neck trauma/massage/chiropractor, recent air travel,
and history of previous neurologic symptoms (specifically denies
h/o numbness, weakness, bowel/bladder problems, blurry vision,
previous vertigo).

Review of Systems: Positive for mild blurry vision in right eye.
The pt denies loss of vision, dysarthria, dysphagia, tinnitus or
hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. The
pt denies recent fever or chills.  No recent weight loss (has 
had
weight gain). Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest
pain.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or

IMAGING:
CTA HEAD AND NECK ___:
1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territory 
infarct. 
2. No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm, dissection or 
vascular malformation, or significant luminal narrowing. 
3. No evidence for sinus venous thrombosis. 

MRI BRAIN ___:
1. A single punctate focus of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity in the 
expected 
location of the right MLF at the level of the midbrain.  
Although there is 
associated diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal, there is no 
definitive ADC hypointense correlate.  Clinical correlation with 
patient's INO symptoms. 
2. Otherwise, there is no other evidence for infarct or other 
FLAIR signal 
abnormalities to suggest demyelinating disease. 
3. 9 mm extra-axial enhancing lesion abutting the left 
transverse sinus, 
likely representing a meningioma. 

MRI C- AND T-SPINE ___:
1. There is no abnormal signal or enhancement of the cervical 
and thoracic 
cord. 
2. Mild cervical spondylosis without significant spinal canal or 
neural 
foraminal narrowing of the cervical and thoracic spine.

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. With maneuvers, there is 
early appearance of agitated saline/microbubbles in the left 
atrium most consistent with a patent foramen ovale. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale. Normal biventricular cavity 
sizes with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic 
function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.  

LOWER EXTREMITY U/S ___:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

MRI PELVIS ___:
No pelvic central vein thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ woman with no significant PMH 
who presents to the ED with headache which woke her up from 
sleep with double vision and vertigo. Her initial eye movement 
exam was significant for a right ptosis, right intranuclear 
ophthalmoplegia, and torsional/downbeating nystagmus. She also 
had a positive Romberg test and could not tandem gait. This 
constellation of symptoms and exam findings localized to the 
right MLF. Her history is atypical, such that, in a young woman 
with no vascular risk factors, demyelinating disease is most 
likely, however the symptoms of sudden onset with rapid 
improvement within 1 day go against this. Additionally, the 
event was thought most likely to be vascular which is favored by 
the pain which was maximal in onset and improved in 1 day, 
however, she has no known stroke risk factors. Patient had a 
CTA/CTV/NCHCT head/neck in the ED was negative for vertebral 
artery dissection, venous sinus thrombosis, aneurysm, bleed, or 
hypodensity. An MRI showed a punctate area of FLAIR 
hyperintensity with convincing ADC hypointensity in the right 
MLF without which likely accounts for her symptoms. She 
underwent LP which was negative for pleocytosis and MS profile 
was negative so etiology was thought most likely vascular. Given 
this, a stroke work-up was pursued including normal cholesterol 
panel (LDL 91, Trigl 133) and HbA1C (5.3%). Patient was started 
on aspirin 81mg and will have Holter monitoring as an 
outpatient. She had a TTE which showed a PFO, with LENIs and MRV 
negative for clots. A hypercoagulable panel was sent prior to 
discharge and returned positive for anti-thrombin deficiency 
after discharge. Her PCP was notified to repeat this as this 
could be a false positive in the setting of acute thrombosis. 
Lastly, she underwent blood patch for post-LP headache and was 
deemed safe for discharge home with close neurology follow-up. 

Transitional issues:
-Incidental meningioma seen on final MRI read, needs to be 
discussed with patient
-Repeat anti-thrombin as outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ with blurry vision and found to have 
a small lesion in your brain in the area that controls eye 
movements. This was suspicious for a small stroke versus 
demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis (MS), however 
your history and spinal fluid were not consistent with MS. ___ 
findings were more concerning for stroke but it is atypical to 
have a stroke at a young age without any typical risk factors. A 
panel of labs was sent to look for an inherited tendency to 
clot. It is important to take an aspirin every day to prevent 
stroke. You will also wear a Holter monitor to look for evidence 
of arrhythmia. As discussed, please stop your birth control pill 
and talk to your GYN about starting a progesterone only 
pill/shot. You also has an ultrasound of your heart which showed 
a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which is a small opening in the 
two top chambers of your heart. If you have blood clots, this 
opening could allow a clot to move from the legs or pelvis to 
the brain, causing a stroke. You had imaging to look for 
evidence of blood clots which was negative in the legs and 
pelvis. You will follow-up with Drs. ___ in clinic 
for further management and the results of all the lab and 
imaging tests. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you, 
Your ___ Doctors
