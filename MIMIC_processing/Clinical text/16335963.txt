Pertinent Results:
EXAMINATION:  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
 
INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with posterior acetabular 
fracture// assess for
DVT
 
TECHNIQUE:  Grey scale, color, and spectral Doppler evaluation 
was performed
on the bilateral lower extremity veins.
 
COMPARISON:  None.
 
FINDINGS: 
 
There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the 
bilateral
common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal color flow 
and
compressibility are demonstrated in the peroneal veins.  1 of 
the paired right
posterior tibial veins is noncompressible and demonstrates an 
occlusive
thrombus within it with and lack of normal flow consistent with 
deep vein
thrombosis.
 
There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral 
veins bilaterally.
 
No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Findings compatible with occlusive deep vein thrombosis 
involving one of the
paired right posterior tibial veins within the right calf.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented from home on ___ for surgery and was 
brought to the preoperative holding area where she was seen and 
evaluated by the anesthesia team. The patient was taken to the 
operating room for open reduction and internal fixation of right 
posterior wall acetabulum fracture.  Procedure was without 
complication and the patient tolerated it well. For full details 
of the procedure please see the separately dictated operative 
report. The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable 
condition and after satisfactory recovery from anesthesia was 
transferred to the floor. The patient was initially given IV 
fluids and IV pain medications, and progressed to a regular diet 
and oral medications by POD#1. The patient was given 
___ antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. The 
patient's appropriate home medications were continued throughout 
this hospitalization. The patient worked with ___ who determined 
that discharge to home with visitation for both occupational and 
physical therapy was appropriate. 

Given her pelvic injury and recent cross-country plane flight, 
the patient underwent bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds to 
assess for deep vein thrombosis.  In the right lower extremity a 
deep vein thrombosis of the posterior tibial vein was found.  
Because of this thrombosis was below the knee, she was not 
treated with full anticoagulation, but rather maintained on her 
prophylactic dosing.  She was closely monitored for signs and 
symptoms of a pulmonary embolism, of which there were none. 
Because of her injury and her altered mobility status in the 
postoperative period, she was asked to follow-up with her 
primary care physician ___ ___ weeks following discharge in order 
to obtain a repeat ultrasound of the right lower extremity to 
assess for incremental growth and proximal spread of her DVT. 

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
percent weightbearing with posterior hip precautions in the 
right lower extremity, and will be discharged on 40 mg of 
enoxaparin nightly for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will follow 
up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was had 
with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

posterior hip precautions

MEDICATIONS:
