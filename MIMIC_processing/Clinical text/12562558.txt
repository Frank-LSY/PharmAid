STUDIES:

Transthoracic Echocardiogram Report (Post-ablation)
Name: ___ ___ MRN: ___ Date: ___ 08:00
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is mildly 
enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal
defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular
wall thickness with a normal cavity size for body size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular
systolic function. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
low normal. The visually estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction is 50-55%. There is no resting 
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. There is
indeterminate diastolic function. Mildly dilated right 
ventricular cavity with normal free wall motion. The aortic
sinus diameter is normal for gender with mildly dilated 
ascending aorta. The aortic arch is mildly dilated with a
mildly dilated descending aorta. There is no evidence for an 
aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. There is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is mild to moderate [___]
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally
normal. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity 
size (for BSA) with low-normal

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
======================
___ yo man with HLD, HTN, hypothyroidism, HF with recovered EF, 
and diagnosis of atrial flutter diagnosed about 7 months ago 
that he has been cardioverted x5, most recently last week who 
presented in recurrent atrial flutter.

The patient was initially uptitrated on his metoprolol. The 
patient was seen by the electrophysiology service and underwent 
atrial flutter ablation on ___. Subsequently, the patient 
remained in sinus rhythm with well-controlled rates. His 
amiodarone was stopped. He was then continued on his home dose 
metoprolol. He will need to continue on rivaroxaban 
indefinitely. He had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed 
EF of 50-55% with low normal regional/global systolic function. 
Ultimately, he was discharged home.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
#MEDICATION CHANGES
[]Stopped medications: Amiodarone

#PCP:
[]TSH was measured at 13. Unclear if this is secondary to 
amiodarone versus underdosed on levothyroxine. Would recommend 
repeating TFTs with T4 in the outpatient setting at discharge 
and in 3 months.
[]Found to have prediabetes given Hgb A1c of 6.0% on admission. 
Would continue to monitor and counsel regarding lifestyle 
modifications. Could consider initiation of metformin if 
indicated

#CARDIOLOGY/ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:
[]Status post atrial flutter ablation on ___. Patient will 
need follow-up in the outpatient setting
[]Continue to manage HF with recovered EF. EF stable this 
admission, no clear evidence of rate related cardiomyopathy

#AT DISCHARGE:
[]Weight: 108.4 kg (238.98 lb) 
[]Cr: 1.0

# CODE: Full (presumed)

PROBLEM BASED SUMMARY:
======================
#Aflutter
Hemodynamically stable on presentation with no laboratory 
abnormalities to suggest instability of rates. S/p multiple 
prior cardioversions. Metop was initially uptitrated to tartrate 
37.5mg q6h. He went for Aflutter ablation on ___, subsequently 
in sinus without issues. Resumed home metop 50XL daily. 
Discontinued amiodarone. Continued Xarelto. Will need EP follow 
up as outpt in ___ weeks.

#Chronic HF recovered EF (50-55%)
___ have had issues w/ uptitration of medications (had ED 
admission fro orthostatic hypotension and dehydration in ___. 
DC weight ___ was 93.5 kg. TTE with EF 50-55%. However, not 
volume overloaded by exam on this admission. No dyspnea, edema, 
crackles, or JVP elevation.
- preload: continued Lasix 40 mg daily
- afterload: continued lisinopril 2.5 mg BID
- NHBK: metoprolol as above

#HLD
- continued atorvastatin 40 mg nightly

#Hypothyroidism 
TSH elevation this admission to ___ also be in the setting of 
amio vs underdosed levothyroxine
- Continued Levothyroxine Sodium 100 mcg PO DAILY 

#New dx prediabetes
#acanthosis nigricans
Noted on exam to have acanthosis nigricans, Hgb A1c 6.0
