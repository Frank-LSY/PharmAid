History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who is semiretired in
property management.  ___ years ago, she had urinary tract
infection and had an MRI study at that time with mental status
changes.  She was not told but was, apparently, diagnosed with 
an
aneurysm at that point in time.  

Recently, two months ago, she had diverticulitis and again had
mental status changes.  An MRI/MRA demonstrates ___ aneurysm
on the right side, which is approximately 4 mm in diameter.  It
is irregular in shape and may well arise from the ___ itself, 
as
opposed the ___ vertebral junction.  

I had a long discussion with the patient and her husband
regarding the natural history of aneurysms as well as potential
treatment options of endovascular and surgical management.  I do
plan to review all of her films at our weekly neurovascular
conference here at the ___ Brain Aneurysm Institute.  Once 
this
review is complete, we can better make estimate of risks and
benefits of continued observation versus potential intervention
with either surgery or endovascular techniques.

herself does have a cardiac aneurysm.
