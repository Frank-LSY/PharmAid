Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old right handed woman with a ? history 
of HLD who presented with a 3 hour episode of L sided "numbness" 
extending from her L chin to her L arm and into her L leg (but 
stopping at the knee). Further history revealed that there was 
likely a component of weakness or arm heaviness to her 
presentation as well. By the time of evaluation in the ___ she 
was back to her baseline, and neuro exam was normal. MRI brain 
showed tiny acute strokes in the L arm motor and sensory cortex, 
consistent with a small embolic stroke with quick resolution of 
symptoms. Given the history that the patient was bending down 
and suddenly had onset of symptoms, there was strong suspicion 
for ASD or PFO. She was admitted on a holiday weekend so got 
LENIs and MRV which were negative with plan for outpatient Echo. 
If PFO/ASD is confirmed she will need hypercoagulability work 
up. She was started on ASA 81 mg in the hospital. LDL was 
elevated at 136 so she was started on atorvastatin for stroke 
prevention.

She was discharged with a plan for outpatient echo, ___ 
monitoring, and possible hypercoag work up.

She endorsed snoring at night and daytime sleepiness. Sleep 
apnea is a risk factor for stroke and for atrial fibrillation, 
so she will need an outpatient work up for OSA.

The patient's symptoms had resolved and she was back to her 
baseline with normal walking on neuro exam, so ___ evaluation 
was not needed.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- outpatient TTE, if this is negative for PFO will need a TEE
- outpatient ___ of Hearts monitor to rule out afib
- follow up with Dr. ___
- cont ASA 81 for stroke prevention
- Follow up MRV final read
- Follow up repeat LDL, goal < 100, started statin
- outpatient work up for OSA with sleep study
- Follow up with PCP

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of L sided numbness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- possible PFO (a hole in your heart) - we will get an 
outpatient echo for this
- hyperlipidemia
- possible obstructive sleep apnea (will get outpatient work up)
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- start aspirin 81 mg
- start atorvastatin 20 mg
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
You left the hospital on a holiday weekend so we were not able 
to take care of all your scheduling for follow up tests. On 
___ morning, please call Cardiology ___ to 
schedule two outpatient tests 1) echocardiogram to look for a 
hole in your heart (PFO) and 2) ___ of hearts monitor to wear 
for 30 days to look for any evidence of atrial fibrillation. 

Once you have heard from Cardiology about the timing of these 
studies, please call Dr. ___ Neurology to let me know the 
timing of the studies so he can follow up on them and let you 
know the results, and order any other tests if needed.

Please also follow up with your PCP, and arrange for an 
outpatient sleep study to look for evidence of obstructive sleep 
apnea.
 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
