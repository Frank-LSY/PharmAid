Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of HTN and T2DM presenting with an episode of 
syncope with head strike iso one month of diarrhea, found to 
have sinus bradycardia upon admission. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============

# Syncope: Likely ___ vasovagal reaction iso volume depletion 
from one month of diarrhea. Other etiologies include cardiac 
arrhythmia given sinus bradycardia and RBBB noted on EKG, no 
other events noted on telemetry. No e/o ischemia given troponins 
negative x2 and no wall motion abnormalities seen on TTE. 
Negative orthostatics, TSH within normal limits, no history 
concerning for seizure. No evidence of trauma on CT head, CT 
C-spine or CT sinus/mandible/maxillary. 

# Sinus bradycardia/RBBB: No evidence of AV delay or block on 
EKG. Sinus bradycardia is possibly ___ medication effect iso 
atenolol usage versus conduction delay given RBBB. Of note, no 
prior EKG for comparison but pt reports RBBB is long-standing, 
possibly ___ hypertension. Patient asymptomatic during 
admission.

# Diarrhea: Patient with 1 month of watery diarrhea, likely ___ 
dietary changes/magnesium supplements vs. inflammatory reaction, 
vs. less likely infectious. Stool cultures sent, pending upon 
discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============

# Hypertension. On home amlodipine-benazepril ___ mg oral daily 
and atenolol 100 mg QD. Blood pressures SBPs 130-160s during 
admission, HRs 40-50s. Atenolol was held during admission and pt 
received amlodipine 5 mg and lisinopril 10 mg QD. Discharged on 
home amlodipine-benazepril ___ mg, home atenolol was held upon 
discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Consider restarting atenolol pending PCP ___
[ ] Continue outpatient diarrhea work up 
[ ] Dilated ascending aorta seen on TTE ___. Follow-up 
echocardiogram is suggested in ___ year; if previously known and 
stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ years. 
[ ] Consider further work up for sinus bradycardia, including 
___ of Hearts monitor to further evaluate for cardiac 
arrhythmia
[ ] Follow up stool cultures (___)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure being part of your care.

You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of a fainting 
episode. You were also found to have a slow heart rate. 

It is likely that your fainting episode was due to a "vasovagal" 
episode where your nervous system overreacts and can cause you 
to pass out. You received CT imaging of your head and spine 
which showed no bone fractures or bleeding. 

It is less likely that your fainting episode was due to a slowed 
heart rate, though you should continue to monitor your slow 
heart rate with your primary care doctor when you leave the 
hospital. You received an echocardiogram (ultrasound image of 
your heart) which did not show any possible cause for your 
fainting. 

You have also been having diarrhea for one month. This is 
unlikely due to an infection and you should continue to manage 
this with your primary care doctor as well.

If you experience any chest pain, difficulty breathing, heart 
palpitations, fevers, chills or worsening diarrhea. 

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Team
