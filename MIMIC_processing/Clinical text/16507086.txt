On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission.  He was also placed on  q15minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. He did not 
require physical or chemical restraints during this 
hospitalization. 
 
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
Upon admission, the patient endorsed ongoing neurovegetative 
symptoms of depression and intrusive suicidal
thoughts that were quite distressing to him. However, he did not 
have any specific intent to harm himself while on the unit. Pt 
stated that the thing which likely caused him to destabilize was 
his girlfriend breaking up with him - but prior to that he was 
overwhelmed by his course load and the need to find a 
competitive COOP which paid, perform well in school, and 
remembering of childhood physical discipline/abuse. He further 
reported having ___ panic attacks in the past few weeks, which 
he characterized as having racing thoughts, muscle tension, 
tremulousness, n/v, palpitations, and crying. Notably he also 
described being fearful of having another panic attack. 

The patientÂ’s presentation was concerning for major depressive 
disorder with consideration of panic disorder and PTSD.

The patient was started on Zoloft 25 mg daily to address sx's of 
anxiety. The patient tolerated the change in dose well and found 
it to be helpful for his mood. However, pt has difficulty with 
emotional dysregulation and distress tolerance, and would 
significantly benefit from outpatient therapy.

At time of discharge, patient noted improvement in his mood, 
concentration, sleep, appetite, and energy. He no longer 
endorsed SI, and reflected back to his SI and previous SA, 
stating that thoughts often occur when feeling overwhelmed and 
in "chaos." He denied ever having deliberate plans, but rather 
attempts and thoughts occur impulsively. Pt was able to 
verbalize coping methods available to him at home including 
thinking of reasons to live, distraction, and deep breathing. Pt 
further demonstrated willingness and preserved capacity to 
participate in safety planning (calling friends, outpatient 
providers, and then 911).

4. MEDICAL
N/A
 
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU: 
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. He was often visible in the 
milieu and was appropriate in his interaction with peers and 
staff without ever requiring restraint or seclusion. 
 
#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Patient was provided with the opportunity to discuss diagnosis 
and treatment with his family, however patient declined 
involvement of family.
 
#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Zoloft
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: outpatient psychiatry, therapy f/u
- Behavioral Interventions: encourage DBT skills (emotional 
regulation, distress tolerance)
- Guardianships: N/A
 
INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team.  
 
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
 
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon SI.  His/her risk 
factors noted at that time included history of suicide attempts, 
chronic mental illness, history of abuse, history of 
self-injurious behavior, male gender, single relationship 
status, suicidal ideation with plan, impulsivity, poorly 
controlled mental illness, no established outpatient providers, 
hopelessness, insomnia, recent self-injurious behaviors, recent 
personal loss (with breakup), and limited coping skills. 
Modifiable risk factors were addressed during hospitalization 
via medication management, psychotherapeutic intervention, and 
aftercare coordination.  The patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors, including age, help-seeking 
behavior, no
chronic substance use, no access to lethal weapons, and 
reality-testing ability. Given the above, my overall assessment 
is that the patient's suicide risk at time of discharge is low.
