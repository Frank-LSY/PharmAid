Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ with history of metastatic rectal CA presents with
progressive abdominal pain.

On surveillance imaging, the patient was noted to have new, 
liver
metastasis that were not amenable to surgery. She underwent Y90
radioembolization on ___ that was tolerated well. Post 
procedure
course was complicated by occasional nausea that has been well
controlled with Compazine.

6 days ago, the patient noticed progressive abdominal girth with
difficulty buttoning her pants. This was associated with
occasional nausea but no vomiting. She has been constipated for
about a month, only able to pass small specs of hard stool. She
had called her outpatient oncologist's office at ___ and 
was
told to come to the emergency department at ___.

Upon arrival to the ED, the patient's vitals were:
T 97 HR 96 BP 135/86 R 18 SpO2 97% RA

1. Interval progression of disease with a larger primary mass
lesion in the sigmoid colon.
2. Progression of hepatic metastatic disease with secondary mass
effect on the vasculature, including narrowing of the main 
portal
vein which is patent. The left portal vein is not clearly
delineated traversing through region of hepatic metastases,
uncertain if this is due to mass effect or thrombosis.
3. New moderate free intraperitoneal fluid.
4. New right adrenal nodule suspicious for metastatic disease as
well as new retroperitoneal adenopathy.

___ Chest (Pa & Lat) 

Hyperinflation without definite superimposed acute
cardiopulmonary process.
Vague nodular opacity projecting over the right anterior seventh
rib, potentially due to overlapping shadows though underlying
pulmonary nodule is not entirely excluded. CT chest would be 
more
sensitive for detection of metastatic disease.
 

She has no fevers or chills. No chest pain or palpitations. No
dyspnea. Abd pain is central and non-radiating without
exacerbating or alleviating factors and is intermittent. No
dysuria. Endorses poor PO intake and thirst. 

ROS: 10 point review of systems discussed with patient and
negative unless noted above

 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  
- ___: Metastatic rectal cancer diagnosis during workup for
bright  
 red blood per rectum. Given the distribution of the hepatic  
 metastases, surgical resection was not possible at that time.  
 - Received 12 cycles of bevacizumab/FOLFOX with palliative  
 intent and demonstrated a good response  
 - ___: Placed on maintenance Xeloda  
 - Interval restaging studies found to have progressive disease
with recurrence of clustered intrahepatic biopsy-proven
metastases.  
 - Received four cycles of bevacizumab/FOLFIRI, also with good  
 response, with consideration of subsequent metastasectomy.  
 However, given the distribution of the intrahepatic metastases, 


 it was concluded that an overly extensive hepatic 
metastasectomy

 would leave a potential inadequate hepatic remnant.  
 - Underwent Y-90 chemoembolization on ___ at ___,
complicated by recurrent vomiting

COMPARISON:  Prior CT torso from outside hospital dated ___ and ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. 
There is no 
evidence of pleural effusion.  There is a small pericardial 
effusion. 
  
ABDOMEN: 
  
HEPATOBILIARY: Since prior, there has been significant interval 
progression of 
disease now with innumerable hypoenhancing liver metastases.  
Conglomerate 
metastatic disease is seen centrally within the liver and toward 
the left.  
There is secondary mass effect on the traversing vessels and 
peripheral 
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in segments two and 
three.  
Specifically, there is narrowing of the main portal vein at the 
porta hepatis 
(02:23) though it remains patent.  The left portal vein is not 
as clearly seen 
and there is contrast in this region though likely in part from 
the left 
hepatic artery (02:18).  There is narrowing of the middle 
hepatic and left 
hepatic veins.  There is no evidence of extrahepatic biliary 
dilatation.  The 
gallbladder is within normal limits.  There is moderate ascites. 

  
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of 
focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  There is no 
peripancreatic 
stranding. 
  
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without 
evidence of focal lesions. 
  
ADRENALS: There is a new 1.8 x 1.0 right adrenal nodule not 
present on most 
recent prior dated ___, likely metastasis.  The 
left adrenal 
gland is normal in size and shape. 
  
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram.  
There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis.  
There is no 
perinephric abnormality. 
  
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate 
normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  
Since prior, 
there has been interval enlargement of the mass lesion centered 
in the 
sigmoid.  There is a more confluent soft tissue mass centered at 
the sigmoid 
colon for an approximate 12 cm long length (previously 
approximately 5 cm).  
There is no definitive bowel lumen identified, however there is 
no upstream 
obstruction.  Engorgement of the adjacent draining veins and the 
IMV are 
noted.  Small amount of free fluid seen within the abdomen. 
  
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
 There is a 
moderate amount of simple free fluid in the pelvis. 
  
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus and bilateral adnexae are within 
normal 
limits. 
  
LYMPH NODES: Increased soft tissue density in the periaortic 
region (02:27) is 
suspicious for adenopathy.  The mesenteric lymph nodes are not 
well evaluated 
on current study.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
VASCULAR: Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications are noted 
throughout the 
abdominal aorta.  Main branches are patent.  There is mild 
narrowing of the 
right renal vein likely due to mass effect from the enlarged 
liver. 
  
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture. 
  
SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Interval progression of disease with a larger primary mass 
lesion in the 
sigmoid colon. 
2. Progression of hepatic metastatic disease with secondary mass 
effect on the 
vasculature, including narrowing of the main portal vein which 
is patent.  The 
left portal vein is not clearly delineated traversing through 
region of 
hepatic metastases, uncertain if this is due to mass effect or 
thrombosis. 
3. New moderate free intraperitoneal fluid. 
4. New right adrenal nodule suspicious for metastatic disease as 
well as new 
retroperitoneal adenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with metastatic rectal cancer to the liver s/p Y90 
radioembolization presents with abdominal pain. A CT scan of the 
abdomen and pelvic showed progression of her hepatic metastases 
and her rectal mass, without evidence of obstruction. She was 
started on stool softeners and was able to pass stool. Etiology 
of pain was thought to be worsening disease. She did not have 
evidence of infection including no peritonitic signs. Her pain 
was mild and she was given IVF and was able to tolerate food at 
time of discharge. She was discharged home with plans for close 
follow up with Dr. ___ plan for chemistry panel to assess 
her hyponatremia. 

#ABDOMINAL PAIN
#CONSTIPATION:
Patient with known metastatic rectal cancer with known liver 
metastases s/p recent Y90 radioemoblization to the liver. A CT 
abdomen and pelvis on admission demonstrates progressive 
metastatic disease as well as primary rectal mass progression. 
She reported increasing difficulty with passing stools but 
responded well to stool softeners and was able to continue 
passing stool and flatus during the admission. A RUQUS showed 
patent portal vasculature without evidence of thrombus and small 
perihepatic ascites, and liver function tests including AST, 
ALT, bilirubin, INR and albumin were not significantly abnormal. 
It was felt that her abdominal pain was related to mild 
constipation from rectal mass and it was improved on discharge. 
She was discharged on senna and bisacodyl with plans to follow 
up with Dr. ___ treatment of her malignancy as below. 

#HYPONATREMIA:
sNa is 125 on arrival with studies suggesting hypovolemia. She 
received IVF with improvement to 128 on discharge. She should 
have a Chem panel checked on ___ at her oncologist office. 

#LEUKOCYTOSIS: No focal infectious findings, improved with IV 
fluids. She was discharged with close instructions to call or 
return if develops a fever. On ___ she had no residual 
abdominal pain so suspicion for infected ascites was low and 
diagnostic paracentesis was felt not to be needed. 

#RECTAL CANCER
#SECONDARY MALIGNANCY OF LIVER:
Liver metastasis are not amenable to resection. Patient 
underwent Y90 radioembolization on ___. CT scan 
demonstrating progressive disease. She should follow up with Dr. 
___ discussion of further therapy. 

#NAUSEA: No significant nausea in house. Tolerated full meal 
prior to DC. 

#GOALS OF CARE: Patient states that she has begun to think about 
her code status and goals of care. She would like to continue to 
"fight" but would not want to undergo procedures that would 
significantly affect her quality of life. Would like to remain
full code for now, but does want to continue these discussions.

Transitional Issues; 
[] Check chem panel on ___ to trend her sodium. DC sodium on 
___ is 128. 
[] Patient needs evaluation for next steps in therapy given 
progression on imaging. 
[] Continue stool softeners and titrate as needed, patient 
notified of warning signs of obstruction. 
[] Patient expressed a desire to continue discussions regarding 
goals of care and code status, please continue these with her as 
appropriate, she was full code this admission.
