Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F transferred from ___ after 
sustaining a mechanical fall from standing. She was found to 
have a C6 bilateral lamina fracture, left maxillary fracture, 
left midface laceration, and left elbow hematoma. She was 
transferred for neurosurgical evaluation. Neurosurgery 
recommended non-operative management with hard cervical collar. 
Plastic surgery evaluated the patient for facial laceration and 
maxillary fracture. They recommended non-operative management. 
Facial nerves were assessed and although her left sided smile is 
decreased it is unlikely due to nerve damage and is probably 
related to soft tissue swelling. The patient was admitted for 
leukocytosis of 21; she was afebrile with stable vital signs. 
Urinalysis was concerning for urinary tract infection and she 
was given 2 doses of ciprofloxacin. Blood and urine cultures 
were obtained.

The patient remained alert, oriented, and hemodynamically 
stable. Pain was well controlled on oral analgesics. She was 
given a regular diet with good tolerability. Urine output was 
monitored and adequate. On HD2 lab work showed resolved 
leukocytosis. The patient denied urinary symptoms and therefore 
no antibioitcs were administered.
