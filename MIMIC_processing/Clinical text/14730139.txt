Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, Ms. ___ was unable to sign a conditional 
voluntary agreement due to her catatonia and was admitted on a 
___ which expired on ___. Ms. ___ refused to sign a 
CV at that time (during a family meeting her father requested 
that the ___ be discharged and she declined to sign a CV). A 
___ was filed, however, the ___ had clinically improved 
and was safe for discharge prior to a court date being set. Ms. 
___ was also placed on q15 minute checks status on admission 
and remained on that level of observation throughout while being 
unit restricted. She was notably restricted from the back 
hallway of the unit at the beginning of her hospitalization due 
to intrusive and disruptive behavior. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
___ was initially very anxious and intrusive on arrival to 
the unit. She frequently approached staff for guidance and was 
difficult to redirect. She needed frequent reassurance that she 
was safe on the unit and was often found pacing the hallways. 
She also demonstrated some bizarre behaviors along with 
echolalia, perseveration, ambitendency, impulsivity, and 
tachycardia. She was initially treated with anti-psychotics 
(Perphenazine which was reportedly tolerated during previous 
admissions) and Ativan qhs and PRN for anxiety with little to no 
improvement. Upon further consideration, her presentation became 
more concerning for an excited catatonia and ___ was given a 
trial of Ativan followed by a standing Ativan taper with 
significant improvement in her thought process, affect, and 
speech. A family meeting was held with ___ and ___ parents, 
who felt strongly that the ___ should be discharged with 
close follow-up. However, ___ had only recently begun to show 
improvement and was at risk of decompensation, especially during 
ongoing medication adjustments at that time. She was started on 
Lithium upon improvement of her symptoms for mood stabilization, 
which she tolerated well and continued to demonstrate 
improvement with increased linearity, clarity and complexity of 
thought, and brighter affect. She denied any thoughts of 
self-harm or harm towards others (which was repeated by 
collateral despite ___ initial claim to have hurt herself 
with keys on initial interview when likely catatonic). The 
differential remains broad with consideration of unspecified 
affective vs. psychotic disorder, though her improvement with 
Lithium suggests possible underlying mood disorder (i.e. bipolar 
spectrum illness). She was discharged on Ativan 1mg TID with an 
additional 1mg daily PRN for anxiety with plan to remain on this 
medication for 6months. She was also discharged on Lithium 600mg 
qhs (last dose adjustment on ___ with a Lithium Level of 
0.6 on ___. Her repeat BMP on ___ was within normal 
limits and TSH was 4.0, which was elevated from admission (TSH 
1.7 on ___ but still within normal limits. Though ___ 
initially struggled to appreciate her symptoms on presentation, 
she gradually gained some ability to reflect on her initial 
presentation and demonstrated insight into her diagnosis of a 
mental illness. She was also able to engage in a meaningful 
discussion about the importance of medication compliance and 
continued care with outpatient providers. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
Ms. ___ does not have any substance use disorders, and 
therefore did not require any counseling or treatment in this 
regard.

4. MEDICAL
Ms. ___ was medically cleared in the ED and no acute medical 
issues prevented admission to Deac 4. She initially had 
tachycardia which improved with treatment of her catatonia.  

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
Ms. ___ was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
occupational therapy and social work groups that focus on 
teaching patients various coping skills. Ms. ___ was initially 
unable to participate in these groups given her presentation, 
however, by time of discharge often attended these groups. She 
was frequently visible on the milieu. Though she was initially 
intrusive and frequently found pacing, with treatment and by 
time of discharge she was appropriately interacting with staff 
and peers.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Ms. ___ gave verbal permission for the team to contact her 
outpatient therapist, Dr. ___. He was provided with a 
summary of Ms. ___ presentation to the ___ ED/Deac 4 and 
an update of her progress since admission on Deac 4, and they 
provided collateral information. Ms. ___ did not have an 
outpatient psychiatrist but had an outpatient psychiatry 
appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist through ___ 
___ (established through her PCP) upon discharge. 

Ms. ___ gave verbal permission for the team to contact her 
family (parents and cousin). Her parents visited the unit, were 
given updates about Ms. ___ progress while on the unit and 
came for a family meeting prior to discharge and informed of the 
discharge plan. Of note, while they are very supportive of 
___ they appeared to have limited understanding of ___ 
diagnosis. However, they expressed commitment to encouraging 
medication compliance and outpatient follow-up. 

6. INFORMED CONSENT: 
*Medication: Lithium
---Benefits: Mood stabilization
---Adverse effects: GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea), acne, rash, 
alopecia, weight gain (common), sedation (common), leukocytosis, 
lithium toxicity (ataxia, dysarthria, delirium, tremor, memory 
problems), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (polyuria, 
polydipsia), renal impairment, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures 
(rare), pseudotumor cerebri (rare). Ms. ___ was informed of 
alternative treatments, the consequences of no treatment, and 
the expected duration of treatment. She appeared to appreciate 
the information conveyed in the consent process by asking 
appropriate questions, which were answered by the treatment 
team, and expressing understanding of the potential risks and 
benefits (see above). Prior to starting treatment, the team also 
discussed the ___ right to decide whether to take this 
medication as well as the importance of the ___ actively 
participating in the treatment.  Ms. ___ understood the above 
and consented to begin the medication.

7. RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, Ms. ___ was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself. Ms. ___ static risk 
factors noted at that time include recent diagnosis of a mental 
illness, recent discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit, 
family history of mental illness, age, single relationship 
status, and unemployment. The modifiable risk factors identified 
were as such: possible suicidal ideation (made vague statement 
during PCP visit prior to presentation), psychosis, disorganized 
and bizarre behavior, impulsivity, medication non-compliance, 
poorly controlled mental illness, lack of engagement with 
outpatient treatment (consistently saw PCP and psychologist but 
had not established care with outpatient psychiatrist), poor 
reality testing, severe anxiety, insomnia, question of active 
self-injurious behaviors (mentioned hurting herself with keys on 
early interview, but no history of self-injurious behaviors by 
collateral), loss of executive function, acutely stressful 
events (father's health, studying for the MCAT, quitting her job 
as a ___). These modifiable risk factors were 
addressed with acute stabilization in a safe environment on a 
locked inpatient unit, psychopharmacologic adjustments, 
psychotherapeutic interventions (OT groups, SW groups, 
individual therapy meetings with psychiatrists), and presence on 
a social milieu environment. Ms. ___ is being discharged with 
many protective factors, including female gender, sense of 
responsibility to family, help-seeking behavior, life 
satisfaction, future-oriented viewpoint, strong social supports, 
lack of suicidal ideation, consistent outpatient follow-up, 
positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers (PCP 
and psychologist) with new appointment scheduled with outpatient 
psychiatrist, medication compliance (has been compliant during 
hospitalization and states that she will continue to take 
medications following discharge with close follow-up with 
outpatient providers), no prior suicide attempts/self-injurious 
behavior, no chronic substance use, and improved reality-testing 
ability at time of discharge. Overall, based on the totality of 
our assessment at this time, Ms. ___ is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of harm to self nor danger to others. 

Our prognosis of this ___ is fair given her strong social 
support, outpatient follow-up, commitment to medication 
compliance, and high level of functioning with no thoughts or 
history of self-harm. However, it should be noted that the 
___ has a history of medication non-adherence and her family 
demonstrated limited insight into her condition.
