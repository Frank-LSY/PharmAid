Chief Complaint:
confusion, left temporal IPH

none

 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year old gentleman with history of recurrent left
hemispheric intraparenchymal hemorrhages, prior MI, who presents
with confusion, found on OSH scan to have an acute left temporal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Wife and daughter provide history. He was last seen normal the
evening prior to admission, when he complained of a typical
headache. He took ibuprofen which improved the headache. The 
next
morning, his son-in-law went downstairs and found him somewhat
confused at the bottom the stairs, unable to climb them up. The
daughter is unsure of details as both the patient and his
son-in-law went separately to work and she was not present for
this episode. Apparently, the patient returned from work at
1:30pm (his wife presumes he took the car but did not check)
because his coworkers were concerned that he was acting
differently. He reportedly kept repeating "I don't know, I
forget" when asked questions. He recognized his wife and 
daughter
but confused his daughter with his wife's name, and could not
recall the names of his grandchildren or his coworkers. He had
difficulty finishing sentences, and daughter does feel that he
was speaking nonsensically, as well as slurring his speech and
stuttering. Daughter thinks his right lip was possibly droopy 
but
no other motor weakness or difficulty with gait.

They were concerned for a stroke and brought him to ___.
A noncontrast head CT was performed which showed an acute left
temporal IPH, and he was subsequently transferred to ___ for
further care. Since arrival, wife and daughter have noted slow
gradual improvement of his speech, but not yet back to normal.

Of note, he has history of prior left sided nontraumatic
intraparenchymal hemorrhages: initially had occipital/temporal
lobe hemorrhage, found incidentally on workup of headaches
___. He was referred to Dr. ___ Dr. ___ for
evaluation. Subsequent MRI/MR spectroscopies showed no 
underlying
mass. A routine MRI on ___ showed a new left occipital lobe
hemorrhage.

ROS could not be obtained directly from pt, but family state he
has not been complaining of loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing
difficulty, focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae, bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.
Wife does think that his cognition has slowly worsened over the
past few months. It occasionally improves but then worsens 
again.

He has not had recent fevers or chills, and has mild weight 
gain.

 
Past Medical History:
Left sided hemisphere hemorrhages, see above for details
Prior MI (details unknown), not treated with stent or surgery
 
Social History:
___

IMAGING
=======

CTA HEAD AND NECK ___:
A stable 1.9 cm left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma with mild 
increased 
surrounding edema and no midline shift or significant mass 
effect. Mild subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left parietal 
convexity. No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm, 
dissection, vascular malformation or significant luminal 
narrowing. Sub 5 mm lung nodules, as described, for which a 
dedicated CT of the chest is recommended. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old gentleman with history of recurrent 
left hemispheric IPH, prior MI, who initially presented with a 
chief complaint of confusion. He was found on OSH scan to have 
an acute LT temporal IPH. His initial exam notable for mixed but 
mostly nonfluent aphasia which correlates to the area of 
hemorrhage. 

Hospital course by system: 

# Neuro
Presented with the above mentioned symptoms. Repeat noncontrast 
head CT with LT temporal-frontal ICH and some surrounding edema. 
Prior MRI for comparison showing LT occipital & parietal blood 
products with superficial siderosis. Etiology consistent with 
amyloid, as this is his third IPH since ___. ___ consulted 
and recommended for home with supervision with increased 
stimuli, assist with all IADLs, and intermittent supervision at 
home. In terms of risk modification added Propranolol 80mg PO 
daily to keep SBP <130 and for headache prophylaxis, as he had 
medication overuse headache on presentation. We recommended 
discontinuation of all NSAIDs 

# Cardiovascular
Hypertension addressed with Propranolol as above. EKG 
non-ischemic appearing. Ruled out MI w/ troponin x2.

# Metabolic/TOX/ID
Assessed STox, LFTs, and UTox, which were negative. UA also 
negative.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of confusion and 
difficulty speaking resulting from an ACUTE left sided bleed in 
your brain. We have imaged your brain with CT and found you to 
have a new left sided bleed which was stable throughout your 
admission. We compared it to your previous MRI and think this is 
due to a combination of your blood pressure and accumulation of 
protein plaques in the brain.  

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all 
the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being 
deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of 
symptoms.  

During your admission we performed the following interventions:  
stopped your ibuprofen or any medication that contains the words 
NSAIDs on the label as these can increase your bleeding risk. We 
added a blood pressure medication called propranolol 80mg oral 
daily to control your blood pressure while preventing your 
headaches. You will need follow up with your primary care doctor 
in terms of increasing the dose as needed. We have asked you to 
monitor your blood pressure daily and keep a log to take to your 
PCP. You will need follow up with the neurology department, as 
below. You were seen by physical and occupational therapy who 
recommended outpatient speech therapy. 

Instructions: 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
