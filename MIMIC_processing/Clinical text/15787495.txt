associated chest "heaviness" for days, but no radiation,
pressure, associated nausea (though she has had intermittent
nausea since the surgery), lightheadedness, or dizziness.  She

___ which showed multiple PEs by report.  She was then

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with the
past medical history of generalized anxiety disorder, vitamin D
deficiency, and is s/p same-day laparoscopic epigastric and
umbilical hernia repair ___ who presents with dyspnea and was
found to have bilateral PEs

#Acute pulmonary emboli 
Likely provoked in the setting of surgery and limited mobility.
Her EKG did not show right heart strain. Her troponin was
negative. Her BNP was slightly elevated. Initially was treated 
with lovenox and was switched to rivaroxaban on discharge. She 
will need anticoagulation for at least 6 months. She was weaned 
from oxygen. Although this was likely provoked in the setting of 
surgery and OCPs her PCP can consider ___ hypercoaguable workup as 
an outpatient. 

#Birth control for family planning (not needed for other GYN
reasons) 
I stated that if she and her provider think that
___ pill or IUD would be acceptable alternatives,
then these can be pursued over her current method given above 
PEs. 

#s/p bilateral small hernia repairs - per surgery, healing well
and no need for further intervention and no contraindication for
anticoagulation. Will have follow up with her surgery team.  

#Anxiety and depression - cont SSRI

#Vitamin D deficiency - cont home med
