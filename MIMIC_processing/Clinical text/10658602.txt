History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a ___ year old lady with history of 
depression
and ADHD, migraines who presents with ___ hour episode of slowed
speech, fatigue, possible disorientation.

She has been under a lot of stress recently as she is starting a
new job as an ___, ___ and has a daughter with a medical
issue in ___. She is on the Board here at ___. However, she
has been feeling well although with some anxiety and sleeping 
ok.

This morning she woke up and didn't have time to eat and had to
get to work. When she got into her car around 9A she felt
lightheaded (not dizzy) and somewhat fatigued all over and 
tired.
She had no changes in her vision. She called her husband and was
talking to him on the phone while driving into work. He felt 
like
her speech was very slow but fluent and she did not seem
confused. Given how slowed her speech sounded he encouraged her
to pull over. She did not pull over initially and felt like she
was unclear about which lanes to be in. She then accidentally
bumped into someone and ultimately pulled off the round. A UPS
driver pulled over to help her and spoke with her husband. Her
husband sand the UPS driver said she had been swerving and 
seemed
to be talking slow. The patient herself admits that all of the
was very hazy and she doesn't have much memory for this. She
denies weakness, tingling, numbness, frank dizziness. She was
able to walk but perhaps felt a bit off balance. 

She went to ___ where she was told her BG
was borderline. She had BP 150/77. She had CTH which was normal
and she was ultimately transferred to ___. She says she 
doesn't
really remember being at ___ but remembers
the ambulance ride here which is when she essentially returned 
to
her baseline. Her husband thinks she is almost 100% now in terms
of speech but perhaps seems a bit tired. 

She denies recent etoh, ingestion, new medications. She has no
history of seizure, stroke or blood clot. She did have a
concussion a few years ago. She had left leg weakness in her ___
and was worked up for MS. ___ says she had an LP that showed 
high
white blood cells and thought she had an infection. About ___ 
years
ago she got tingling in her left leg again and reportedly had an
MRI which showed no lesions so she was told she did not have MS.
___ does have a history of migraines about 2 times a year with
season change. She gets bitemporal throbbing, pressure and
photophobia. She takes medicine and goes in a dark room and it
goes away. She has never had complex features with these. 
 

ROS: no fevers, chills, sob, chest pain, diarrhea, dysuria,
abdominal pain.

vcEEG 

FINDINGS:  
CONTINUOUS EEG: The background activity shows a fairly well 
organized and well 
sustained, symmetric, low to moderate voltage posterior dominant 
rhythm of 
___ Hz. There is small to moderate superimposed frontally 
predominant beta 
activity. There are occasional brief bursts of low to moderate 
voltage mixed 
frequency focal slowing seen independently in the temporal 
regions 
bilaterally, left >> right. There are also occasional brief <1 
second ___ Hz 
runs of sharp transients in the left more than right temporal 
region most 
consistent with wicket spikes, a variant of uncertain 
significance. 
  
SLEEP: The patient progresses from wakefulness to N1, N2, and 
REM sleep at 
appropriate times with no additional findings. 
  
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations. 
  
CARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a generally regular rhythm with an 
average rate of 
50-70 bpm. 
  
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video-EEG monitoring 
study due to: 
1. Occasional brief bursts of focal slowing seen independently 
in the temporal 
regions bilaterally, left much more than right. This finding 
indicates 
independent focal regions of subcortical dysfunction that is 
nonspecific in 
etiology. 
  
There are no pushbutton events. No epileptiform discharges or 
electrographic 
seizures are seen. 

FINDINGS:  
CONTINUOUS EEG: The background activity shows a fairly well 
organized and well 
sustained, symmetric, low to moderate voltage posterior dominant 
rhythm of 9 
Hz. There is small to moderate superimposed frontally 
predominant beta 
activity. There are occasional brief bursts of low to moderate 
voltage mixed 
frequency focal slowing seen in left temporal region. There are 
also 
occasional brief <1 second ___ Hz runs of sharp transients in 
the left more 
than right temporal region most consistent with wicket spikes, a 
variant of 
uncertain significance. 
  
SLEEP: The patient progresses from sleep to wakefulness at 
appropriate times 
with no additional findings. 
  
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations. 
  
CARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a generally regular rhythm with an 
average rate of 
50-80 bpm. 
  
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video-EEG monitoring 
study due to: 
1. Occasional brief bursts of focal slowing seen in the left 
temporal region. 
This finding indicates a focal region of subcortical dysfunction 
that is 
nonspecific in etiology. 
  
There are no pushbutton events. No epileptiform discharges or 
electrographic 
seizures are seen. Compared to the prior day's study, there is 
no significant 
change.

The vessels of the circle of ___ and their principal 
intracranial branches 
appear normal without stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation 
greater than 
3mm.  There are small bilaterally patent posterior communicating 
arteries.  
There is a patent anterior communicating artery complex, and the 
left anterior 
cerebral artery A1 segment has a fenestration, anatomic variant. 
 The dural 
venous sinuses are patent.

There is no evidence of internal carotid stenosis by NASCET 
criteria. 
The carotidandvertebral arteries and their major branches appear 
normal with 
no evidence of stenosis or occlusion. 
  
  
  
OTHER: 
The visualized portion of the lungs are clear.  The visualized 
portion of the 
thyroid gland is within normal limits. There is no 
lymphadenopathy by CT size 
criteria.  Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are noted, 
most advanced 
at the C6-C7 level. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. No acute intracranial abnormality on noncontrast CT head. 
2. Patent circle of ___ without evidence of 
stenosis,occlusion,or aneurysm. 
3. Patent bilateral cervical carotid and vertebral arteries 
without evidence

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with past medical history significant for 
ADHD, depression, prior concussions, and remote prior suspected 
transverse myelitis (by history), who presented to the ___ 
emergency department after a transient episode of 
disorientation, very slow speech, low impact car crash, and 
somnolence all of which have resolved. 

MRI Head with and without contrast was unrevealing. cvEEG was 
notable for brief bursts of focal slowing in the left greater 
than right temporal regions. Telemetry monitoring was 
unremarkable. Metabolic work-up was normal. No signs of anemia 
or infection on complete blood count with differential. 
Rheumatological screening work-up was negative. Chest X-ray was 
negative. 

Transient episode of amnesia, speech disturbance, and confusion 
following prodromal depersonalization sensation was suggestive 
of a possible temporal lobe seizure without clear risk factors 
on imaging or EEG, although the duration of the episode and the 
largely preserved level of awareness would be somewhat atypical. 
Consideration also given to an atypical presentation of 
transient global amnesia, though the apparent speech disturbance 
and vehicle collision would again represent atypical features. 
As this episode would have represented a first-time seizure with 
unrevealing imaging and EEG, treatment was deferred, though may 
be considered for future episodes.

Transitional issues:
- Outpatient neurology follow-up, consider repeat EEG
- Follow-up with primary care provider regarding elevated 
phosphorus of 4.7. Follow-up on sedimentation rate that is 
pending. Follow-up on urine culture that is pending. Urine tox 
positive for marijuana, follow-up on counseling regarding 
prolonged use.
- Primary care providers to assist in providing a psychologist 
for patient to speak with in the setting of her acute stress.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the ___ emergency department after a transient 
episode of disorientation, very slow speech, low impact car 
crash, and somnolence all of which have resolved. Your first 
time transient episode at time of discharge may have represented 
a seizure with subsequent post-ictal process or transient global 
amnesia. 

You had an EEG study that did not show signs of seizures and an 
MRI which was normal.

You are being discharged without any medication changes.  

Please follow up with our neurology team in ___ll minor events in a diary, or please consider going to the ED 
in you have another prolonged episode as this may change our 
diagnosis and treatment considerations.  

Please read the following adopted for you from UPTODATE:

What are seizures?
Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. 
Seizures can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely. 
Most seizures last only a few seconds or minutes.

Epilepsy is a condition that causes people to have repeated 
seizures. But not everyone who has had a seizure has epilepsy. 
Problems such as low blood sugar or infection can also cause 
seizures. Other problems such as anxiety or fainting spells can 
cause events that look like seizures.

What are the symptoms of a seizure?
There are different kinds of seizures. Each causes a different 
set of symptoms.
People who have "tonic clonic" or "grand mal" seizures often get 
stiff and then have jerking movements. People who have other 
types of seizures have less dramatic changes. For instance, some 
people have shaking movements in just 1 arm or in a part of 
their face. Other people suddenly stop responding and stare for 
a few seconds.  Others have changes in behavior that represent a 
seizure.  

Should I see a doctor or nurse if ___ have a seizure?
If you have never had a seizure before and you have one, you (or 
whoever is with you) should call for an ambulance (in the US and 
___, dial ___. Having a seizure can be a sign that 
something is wrong with your brain.

How are seizures treated?
The right treatment for seizures depends on what is causing 
them. If you have seizures because of an infection, you will 
probably need treatments to get rid of the infection. On the 
other hand, if you have repeated seizures because of epilepsy, 
you will probably need anti-seizure medicines, also called 
"anti-convulsants."

Until you have your seizures under control, DO NOT DRIVE.  
___ law prohibits driving after any event where 
one looses consciousness for more for 6 months, and requires 
absence of subsequent event, with recommended doctor's 
clearance.

Also, if your seizures are not under control make sure to take 
other safety steps. For example, do not swim without someone 
else nearby who could help you if you started having a seizure. 
And avoid activities that could result in you falling from a 
height.

How can I reduce my chances of having more seizures?
You can:

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol can increase the risk of seizures.

Avoid drugs, as they can also increase risk of seizures.

Avoid sleep deprivation.  

What should my family members do if they see me having a 
seizure?
Ask your doctor what your family members should do. Some people 
will have seizures from time to time, and they might not need to 
see a doctor every time. But if you have a seizure that lasts 
longer than 5 minutes or if you do not wake up after a seizure, 
your family members should call for an ambulance (in the US and 
___, dial ___.

Your family members should not try to put anything in your mouth 
while you are having a seizure. But they should make sure you do 
not bang against any hard surfaces.

We recommend also following up with a psychologist, to help you 
with your stressful transitions at this time.

Please follow-up with your primary care provider to review this 
recent event.

Thank you for the opportunity to care for you,

The ___ Neurology Team
