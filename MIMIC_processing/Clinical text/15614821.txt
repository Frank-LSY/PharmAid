Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male, with past
history of muscular dystrophy and cognitive impairment, who
presented with abdominal pain and nausea two hours after
ingesting a ___ Cr√®me donut most consistent with likely
Staphylococcal food poisoning, now resolved. He also had a mild
acute kidney injury and mild hyperkalemia which improved with IV
fluids. He was back to his baseline this morning without further
intervention and determined to be stable for discharge pending
his ability to tolerate POs.

# Foodborne staphylococcal intoxication: Patient presented with
abdominal pain and nausea two hours after ingestion of cream
containing donut, which resolved overnight with supportive care. 


#Constipation: Colonic dilatation without obstruction, which
seems chronic and related to muscular dystrophy, was seen on
imaging and did not require further intervention. Patient no
longer complaining of pain this morning, may require bowel
regimen as outpatient for management of likely decreased bowel
motility.

# Hyperkalemia: patient was mildly hyperkalemic to 5.5 on
admission but resolved with IVF administration.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
# Patient with chronic colonic dilatation, would consider bowel 
regimen as outpatient
# Patient with mild transaminitis, would follow up LFTs 
outpatient, consider further workup
