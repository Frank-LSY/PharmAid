REPORTS: 
========

EKG OSH: NSR, TWF II, aVL, V1. Q wave III, ?aVF  

CATH (___): 
Coronary Anatomy Dominance: Right
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent CAD. The LAD had no 
significant stenosis. The Cx had a 60% ulcerated lesion with 
visible clot into moderatel sized bifurcating OM. The RCA had 
mild luminal
irregularities.

Interventional Details:
Based on diagnostic coronary angiogram we decided to proceed 
with PCI of the LCx. Based on the ulcerated appearance vs. clot 
we thought it was the culpruit lesion and unstable. A 6 ___ 
XB 3.5 guide
failed to engage the LMCA properly so we enganged the LMCA with 
a 6 ___ JL 3.5 guiding catheter, which provided good support 
for the procedure. Heparin boluses were given prophylactically 
and the patient was loaded with Plavix. A short Prowater wire 
crossed the lesion with minimal dificulty. We then direct 
stented with a 2.5*18 mm Resolute Integrity Rx ___ at 
16 ATM fro ___ and then postdilated
with a 3.5*15 mm NC Euphora Rx balloon at 18 ATM for ___ and 
then at 16 ATM for ___. Final angiogram revealed no residual 
stenosis, TIMI 3 flow and no visible evidence of dissection or 
ruputre.The patinet left the cath lab pain free and without any 
ECG signs of ischemia.
Intra-procedural Complications: None.
Impressions:
1. Single vessel disease.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for HLD who presented as a transfer 
from OSH with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG 
findings consistent with NSTEMI. Patient underwent cath ___ 
with DES in mLCX.

#NSTEMI
#CAD
Patient presented with chest pain and was found to have elevated 
troponins with non specific TW changes on EKG. Initially started 
on ASA, plavix, metoprolol, atorvastatin and heparin drip. Trp 
downtrended. Chest pain resolved with SL nitro. Underwent 
cardiac cath ___ with PCI (DES to mLCX). Patient had 
episode of chest pain post procedurally which resolved with SL 
nitro. EKG remained stable. Otherwise, there were no 
complications. Patient discharged on ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, 
and atorvastatin. No indication for ACEi at this time. Please 
consider cardiac rehab as outpatient. 

#HLD: started on Atorvastatin. 

#TOBACCO USE: Counseled on tobacco cessation and given 
information for cessation.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest pain and 
lab work which showed you were having a heart attack.

What was done while I was in the hospital?
==============================================
- You were given heart healthy medicines to treat your heart 
attack
- You had a procedure (heart catheterization) which showed a 
blockage in one of your heart vessels. You had a stent (drug 
eluting stent) placed to open up the blockage.

What should I do now that I am going home? 
==============================================
- Stop smoking cigarettes
- Fruits, vegetables, and foods with fiber can help prevent 
heart disease 
- Avoid foods with trans fats, which are found in many fast 
foods as well as foods with Saturated fats, which are found in 
red meats and many cheeses
- Please follow-up with your PCP ___ at 12:30P), who will 
help connect you with a cardiologist. 

-It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. Very importantly, you are now taking aspirin and 
clopidogrel (also known as Plavix). These two medications keep 
the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your 
risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot 
forming in your heart stents, and you may die from a massive 
heart attack. 

Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to 
your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the 
medications.  

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your medical care.
-Your ___ Team
