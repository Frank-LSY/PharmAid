Pertinent Reports: 
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is
moderate tortuosity beginning in the proximal segment. There is 
a stent in the ostium and proximal
segment. There is a 70% stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Septal Perforator, arising from the mid segment, is a small 
caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel.
The SinoAtrial, arising from the proximal segment, is a small 
caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.

Findings
 Single vessel coronary artery disease.

Recommendations
 DAPT for 12 months; 30 months if can tolerate. RIsk factor

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with history of CAD s/p recent ___
___, hyperlipidemia, family history of premature CAD, who
presents for evaluation of jaw pain reminiscent of prior
presentation of NSTEMI.

# CORONARIES: ___
# PUMP: Unknown
# RHYTHM: Sinus

# Unstable Angina
Given ongoing intermittent pain at rest started a nitro & 
heparin gtt with relief of chest pain. ECG was without ST 
changes, trops/CK-MB were normal. Coronary angiogram was 
performed which revealed sluggish flow to LAD and a DES was 
placed. He was Jaw/arm/chest pain free after placement of stent. 
He will need to continue DAPT. 

#CODE: Full confirmed

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
-You were having chest pain similar to your past heart attack. 

What happened while I was in the hospital?
-We ran several tests to determine that you were not having a 
large heart attack. 
-We performed a procedure called a coronary angiogram to 
evaluate for any blockages in your heart. We noted one area of 
blockage and a stent was placed. 

What should I do when I go home?
-continue taking all of your medication as prescribed
-return to the hospital if you experience similar chest pain 
which is not relieved by nitroglycerin.
