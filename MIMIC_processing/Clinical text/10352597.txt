Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
==============
___ w/ uterine fibroids presenting with asymptomatic incidental 
anemia likely secondary to blood loss anemia from menorrhagia, 
received two transfusions with improvement.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#) IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA:
Hemoglobin initially 6.5. Received 2 transfusions with 
improvement in hemoglobin to 8.2 on discharge. Remained 
hemodynamically stable and workup notable for hypoproliferative 
microcytic anemia and iron deficiency (ferritin 12); negative 
hemolysis labs. Endoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. 
Likely has blood loss anemia in the setting of uterine fibroids 
and menorrhagia. Needs to follow up with outpatient PCP, and 
consideration of referral to hematology for IV iron infusions. 
Needs to have repeat CBC checked in 1 week.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Asthma: continued home nebs, and prednisone; held home breo 
(non-formulary)

#Sinusitis: continued home fluticasone

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================================
[] Patient needs repeat CBC within 1 week of discharge
[] If persistent guaiac positive after metro/menorrhagia 
controlled or between menses, consider outpatient nonurgent 
capsule
[] Please refer patient to outpatient IV iron infusions.
[] Please refer patient to gynecology for management of 
menorrhagia and fibroids

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted 
because of your low blood counts.  You received 2 units of blood 
with improvement in your blood count.  You underwent an 
endoscopy and colonoscopy, which was normal.  You were found to 
have iron deficiency, and need to follow up with your primary 
care doctor within 1 week, and consider outpatient intravenous 
iron infusions.  You should also be referred to gynecology for 
management of your uterine fibroids and heavy periods, which is 
likely contributing to your low blood counts and iron 
deficiency.  

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
