Brief Hospital Course:
SAFETY:  The pt. was placed on 15 minute checks on admission and 

remained here on that level of observation throughout.  She was 
unit-restricted.  In the ___, she was briefly requiring 
soft-point restraints for trying to repeatedly trying to jump 
out of bed after taking too many medications at home, and when 
appearing quite increasingly drowsy, at one point required a 
chemical restraint in ___, before admission required Ativan 2 mg 
once.  
 
LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC: Patient initially was quite drowsy in ___ and on 
arrival to floor after medication overdose.  She was initially 
continued on her home lexipro, Wellbutrin and trazodone.  When 
she became more clear, appeared very anxious and focusing on 
leaving hospital as soon as possible, initially denying this was 
an overdose, stating she did not know how many medications she 
took.  We were initially concerned about inconsistent reports of 
number of medications she took during different parts of 
hospitalization.  In an interview with primary team on 
psychiatry floor, stated that on ___, she initially 
took 2 pills of fioricet, then stated wasn't sure if she took 
too much klonopin (in past notes since
arrival, different reports about amount of medications included
___ mg klonopin per husband's collateral in ___, 6 pills of
fioricet and 3 pills of klonopin per ___ resident accept note,
and per Dr. ___ addendum in addendum, patient
stated took an entire bottle of klonopin because she was "really 
sad
and wanted to die").   

We spoke with ___ therapist and with psychiatrist who 
works with ___ outpatient psychiatric NP, with details 
above in HPI section.  We spoke with Dr. ___ 
___ at her outpatient practice who works with ___ 
___, NP who was away this week, who agreed with considering 
starting abilify and with our plan to observe over weekend.  

We offered trial abilify 2 mg PO daily as an adjunct for 
depression.  Patient was in contact with her outpatient 
therapist, Dr. ___ the weekend, and felt this was 
helpful in her eventual transition to the outpatient setting.  
Her family offered to lend additional support once she was 
discharged.  She was observed over the weekend, though there was 
initial concern for significant minimization of events leading 
to hospitalization, specifically overdose, and role she played 
in these events, patient was participating in treatment.  She as 
well as her family were organized and helpful at coordinating 
their future outpatient plans with their providers.  

On ___, briefly spoke with ___ PCP, ___, 
___ had prescribed fioricet.  ___ PCP states this event 
was a surprise, states she had previously removed klonopin 
medication in computer system after prescribing fioricet, that 
it appears ___ medications she was taking de facto daily 
appears to have been different from what patient had verbally 
described to PCP, and believes she had verbally discussed not 
taking both at same time with patient.  She agrees with our 
recommendation to avoid prescribing fioricet for patient after 
discharged from hospital.  

At time of discharge, she denied SI, her minimization and 
externalization of her overdose and its causes appeared somewhat 
decreased, and we also believed would be helpful for her 
long-term recovery to be discharged before her new work as 
___ began on ___.  Therefore, we decided to 
continue with discharge on ___.  Of note, on day of 
discharge, there was some intermittent focusing on timing of 
discharge, how events will appear in records, intermittently 
deciding if she should ask her lawyer to come into hospital.  
She wished to clarify that she does not believe taking too many 
medications the week before was intentional, and does not wish 
for an event like this to happen again. 

At time of discharge, patient denied having significant side 
effects from abilify.  She states was briefly feeling more 
"activated" on day of first dose but currently this has 
improved.   
  
GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
#) Migraine headaches-Chronic, stable during this 
hospitalization.  We suggest not continuing fioricet in 
outpatient setting given medication overdose before arrival, 
have discussed this with ___ PCP.  
  
PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) GROUPS/MILIEU: Pt was encouraged to participate in units 
groups/milieu/therapy opportunities. Use of coping skills and 
mindfulness/relaxation methods were encouraged. Therapy 
addressed family, social, and work issues.  We discussed 
disposition planning with patient, her family, and outpatient 
providers.
 
#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS/FAMILY INVOLVEMENT: We spoke to ___ 
husband and sister, as well as her therapist, outpatient 
psychiatric prescribing office (spoke with Dr. ___ as 
___ NP was away), and her PCP before time of discharge. 
 Can see above for details.  
 
#) INTERVENTIONS:
- Medications: continued Wellbutrin and lexipro, offered 
abilify.  
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: set up outpatient appointments.  
- Behavioral Interventions (e.g. encouraged DBT skills, ect): 
supportive psychotherapy, encouraged DBT skills
 
INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting these medications, and risks  and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the ___ right to decide whether to 
 take this medication as well as the importance of the ___ 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the ___ questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.
 
RISK ASSESSMENT:
 
Acute risk factors included overdose causing sedation for at
least ___ days before able to give a clear history, depressed
mood, intermittent difficulty with anxiety, difficulty with
coping skills, and impulsivity.  We were initially concerned for
notable minimization of events and externalization of what led 
to
her overdose, as well as inconsistent reporting of what she 
took,
as well as in ___ consult note stating she "wanted to die",
though later denying this, which was initially concerning for 
limited insight and judgment. We attempted to mitigate these 
factors with medication management, specifically with offering 
of abilify as adjunct for depression, offering individual, group 
and milieu therapy (patient especially felt benefited from her 
phone calls to her outpatient therapist while in hospital), and 
aftercare planning with her outpatient providers.  We have 
spoken with ___ therapist and her outpatient psychiatry 
office (spoke with Dr. ___ as her regular prescriber, NP 
___, was away), as well as her PCP to coordinate 
appropriate disposition planning.  We have had discussions with 
___ husband and one of ___ sisters, who both wish to 
spend time with her directly after time of discharge to offer 
additional support.  We were able to observe patient to monitor 
for safety and trial abilify, with minimal side-effects at time 
of discharge.  

Chronic risk factors include past suicide attempt, family 
history
of completed suicide, chronic mental illness, chronic medical
problems.  Protective factors include good reality testing, a 
desire to get additional help, steady outpatient providers and 
concerned family.  
 
PROGNOSIS: Good-though there are chronic risk factors in past 
history such as past suicide attempt and family history of 
suicide attempt, and though there initially was minimization of 
meaning of overdose, patient has a desire to get additional 
help, has tolerated new medication abilify, wishes to follow-up 
with outpatient providers, has caring family members who wish to 
give additional support during this time, and therefore believe 
at this time that patient has good chance of continuing to get 
better, and that the least restrictive treatment at this current 
time would be to continue in the outpatient setting with her 
therapist and her psychiatric NP.
