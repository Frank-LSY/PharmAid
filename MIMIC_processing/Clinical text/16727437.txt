Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to Urology after undergoing 
laparoscopic RIGHT ADRENALECTOMY. No concerning intraoperative 
events occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. 
The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and ambulated once. On 
POD1, the patient was restarted on appropriate home medications 
(beta blocker only) and basic metabolic panel and complete blood 
count were checked, pain control was transitioned from PCA to 
oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a clears/toast and 
crackers diet.  Urethral Foley catheter was removed without 
difficulty and diet was advanced as tolerated. The remainder of 
the hospital course was relatively unremarkable. The patient was 
discharged in stable condition, eating well, ambulating 
independently, voiding without difficulty, and with pain control 
on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, dry, and 
intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection or infection. 
The patient was given explicit instructions to follow-up in 
clinic in four weeks.
