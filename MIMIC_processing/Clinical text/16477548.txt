#RISK ASSESSMENT
Moderate imminent risk of harm/violence to self/others.

CHRONIC/STATIC RF
-Man
-Mid ___
-Possibly first psychosis episode/or pre-psychotic
-Unclear family history of psychosis
-Gender identity 
-Anti-social personality trait

MODIFIABLE RF
- Depression - we mitigated this by started the patient with new 
psychopharm treatment, and group therapy in the unit 
- Homicidal ideation - pt denied any HI towards any specific 
person, intent or plan throughout this hospitalization. Given 
the result of his personality assessment, pt might be in a 
pre-psychosis/prodromal stage, which lead to poor interpersonal 
skills. This could potentially results in aggression. 
- Stressful life event- pt's grandfather was recently in a coma 
at ___, and pt was not able to go see him with his parents. 
However, both parents have returned from ___ now. They also 
told the patient that the grandfather is recovering. This 
relived pt's stress. 

PROTECTIVE FACTORS
-Intelligence - pt is a high functioning person, with stable 
academic performance at school
-Family support - pt has a very supportive family
- Supports - pt has some friends to hang out with in the 
community
- Religion- pt is a very religious person, with good church 
support
- Stable housing - pt has a secure place to live 
- Help seeking behavior - pt was able to acknowledge that he 
needs help and willing to be admitted 
- Outpatient providers - pt has a established therapeutic 
relationship with his outpatient treater at ___

#PROGNOSIS
Guarded - Given pt's initial presentation of IOR, paranoia, and 
disorganized thought, it is suspicious if this is a first 
episode of psychosis episode. It is concerning if pt will 
relapse with recurrent psychosis symptoms in the future. His 
personality assessment shows he is likely in a 
pre-psychosis/prodromal stage. If he encounters interpersonal 
conflict, he has a potential to become aggressive. Pt will need 
close monitor and observation at the outpatient setting. 
Schizotypal and anti-social personality traits, and possible 
autistic spectrum might be contributive to his clueless and poor 
socialization skills. However, his symptoms improved rapidly 
with the newly initiated anti-psychotic medication. So it is 
possible his symptom will be responsive to the future medical 
management.
