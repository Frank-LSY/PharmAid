Imaging:
X-ray pelvis no acute fracture
X-ray chest no acute processes
X-ray left shoulder no acute abnormalities
X-ray left humerus no acute abnormalities
CT head impression 1.  Subdural hematoma measuring up to 0.3 cm
in thickness in the left anterior temporal fossa and small
subarachnoid hemorrhage along the inferior surface of the 
frontal
lobe in the anterior left sylvian fissure.  2.  Left zygomatic
maxillary complex fracture involving the left infraorbital canal
orbital floor.
3.  Cervical spondylosis without fracture
CT head: 1. A previously seen small subdural hematoma layering
along the anterior left temporal lobe is no longer visualized,
however there is a new small amount of blood layering in the 
left
lateral ventricle.
2. Small amount of left subarachnoid hemorrhage is less
conspicuous compared with prior.
3. Multiple facial fractures are better evaluated on CT facial
bones performed earlier on same day.

___. Stable small amount of blood in the left lateral ventricle.  
Stable 
ventricular size. 
2. Previously noted left subarachnoid hemorrhage is no longer 
seen. 
3. No new intracranial hemorrhage. 
4. Left zygomaticomaxillary complex and orbital wall fractures 
are again 
partially visualized. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female on Pradaxa for afib who sustained a fall from 
standing. Imaging notable for multiple facial fractures and 
subdural hematoma. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended 
holding pradaxa for ___ weeks, frequent neuro exams, and repeat 
head CT. Plastics was consulted for the facial fractures and 
recommended sinus precautions and outpatient follow-up, no 
surgery. Opthalmology was also consulted due to orbital 
fractures and examined the patient for any globe injury, which 
there was none. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was noted and will 
resolve in a few weeks. 

Repeat head CT showed stable subdural and subarachnoid as well 
as a new small amount of blood layering in the left lateral 
ventricle. The patient remained neurologically intact (at 
baseline mental status with dementia). Six hours later, another 
head CT was obtained, which showed the bleeding to be stable and 
not expanding. 

Pain was well controlled. The patient voided without problem. 
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient did not receive subcutaneous heparin due to her history 
of pradaxa use and concern for bleeding, however venodyne boots 
were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled on tylenol.  The patient was discharged back to her 
assisted living. The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan. She would remain off of 
pradaxa until her neurosurgery follow-up with a repeat head CT 
in ___ weeks. She would also follow-up with the Plastic Surgery 
clinic.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a mechanical fall. You suffered 
facial fractures and a traumatic brain injury (TBI) which caused 
bleeding in your brain. Neurosurgery was consulted and 
recommended stopping your blood thinner Pradaxa for ___ weeks 
until your follow-up appointment and repeat head CT. Plastic 
Surgery was consulted for the facial fractures and recommended 
no acute surgical intervention, sinus precautions, and follow-up 
in 1 week. The Opthalmology doctor evaluated your vision due to 
the fractures of the bones around your eye, and did not find any 
other injury.

Your repeat head CT scan was stable and you are now medically 
cleared for discharge back to your facility. Please note the 
following instructions:

Return to the Emergency Department or see your own doctor right 
away if any problems develop, including the following:
 Persistent nausea or vomiting.
 Increasing confusion, drowsiness or any change in alertness.
 Loss of memory.
 Dizziness or fainting.
 Trouble walking or staggering.
 Worsening of headache or headache feels different.
 Trouble speaking or slurred speech.
 Convulsions or seizures. These are twitching or jerking 
movements of the eyes, arms, legs or body.
 A change in the size of one pupil (black part of your eye) as 
compared to the other eye.
 Weakness or numbness of an arm or leg.
 Stiff neck or fever.
 Blurry vision, double vision or other problems with your 
eyesight.
 Bleeding or clear liquid drainage from your ears or nose.
 Very sleepy (more than expected) or hard to wake up.
 Unusual sounds in the ear.
