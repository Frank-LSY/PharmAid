HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 
___ is a lovely ___ woman with a history of CAD s/p MI in 
___ s/p PCI with stent placement who otherwise has been 
healthy her whole life now presenting with cyclic fevers and 
joint pain.
 
She reports that she has been healthy her whole life until this 
past ___ when she had an episode of swelling around her 
neck. This was spontaneous, came out of nowhere and caused her 
limited mobility in turning her head. She had ___ other 
associated symptoms at that time, ___ new medications, travel and 
otherwise felt well. She saw her PCP who prescribed her 10 days 
of Prednisone and the swelling resolved. Thereafter she was fine 
until she developed fevers and cough in ___, she was 
diagnosed with PNA and treated with Doxycycline but per her 
report the CXR were negative x2 and she required a CT which may 
have shown something. After antibiotics she was well and had ___ 
other issues until ___. In ___ she developed acute onset 
chest pressure, she went to ___ where she was 
diagnosed with an NSTEMI and C.Cath performed and stent placed 
(anatomy unknown to this provider). She was discharged on 
Metoprolol, statin, aspirin and Plavix. Again, following that 
event she was well. 
 
Her current illness starts last ___ when she noticed her 
thumb on her right hand became very swollen, painful and she was 
unable to move it. The swelling and pain spread to all of her 
fingers to the point she could ___ longer use them. She is an 
avid ___ and now she has trouble holding a cup. She saw her 
PCP who prescribed her prednisone again but this time it did not 
do anything. The symptoms progressed though now everyday she 
develops joint pain and swelling in different areas. First it 
was posterior left knee, this resolved within a day then to both 
her feet which initially swelled and were painful and now are 
just painful to walk on. She then developed right shoulder pain, 
then right elbow pain and most recently left shoulder pain which 
now is so swollen and painful she is unable to use her left arm. 
Aside from her hands and fingers bilaterally which has persisted 
throughout this recent course, the pain and swelling is usually 
bilateral and resolves within a day then is followed by a 
different joint. She is highly functional, exercises every 
morning and walks several miles a few times per week. She was so 
fearful she would be unable to get out of bed because of limited 
mobility of her arms / shoulders that she presented to ___
   
In conjunction with these migrating joint pain and swelling she 
has had daily fevers. She indicates she has a fever nearly every 
day around 6pm, often getting as high as 102 degrees. She 
reports occasional night sweats but chills constantly, in fact 
she asks this provider for another blanket though the room is 
warm. She reports a 15lb unintentional weight loss, poor 
appetite and mild dry cough. She denies new rashes, only easy 
bruising while on Plavix/Aspirin. She denies Raynaud phenomena 
when described. Denies dysphagia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
 
She reports her only travel is a road trip with her niece to 
___, during which time she has increased urinary frequency, 
was given Cipro which resolved her symptoms. Otherwise ___ 
dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency. 
 
Prior to initial symptoms in ___ there were ___ new 
medications, now her only new meds are related to her recent PCI 
though her PCP discontinued statin thinking it could be 
affecting her joint pain. 
 
At ___, plain films of her chest and shoulder were 
performed and were non-diagnostic. Attempted aspiration of left 
shoulder without success. Labs revealed normal LFTs though 
albumin 3.3, mild hyponatremia with Na of 127 and a leukocytosis 
with WBC of 21. Flu swabs were negative as was RSV. UA was 
negative. ESR returned >100 and CRP was "elevated" though I do 
not have this number. She was transferred to ___ for further 
evaluation. 
 
On the floor, she feels overall ok aside from ongoing swelling 
and pain in her hands and shoulders, she is unable to move 
either arm much but otherwise has ___ other significant symptoms.
