Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
headache, memory loss
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A

 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with history of HTN,
HLD, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease s/p 2 drug
eluting stents who presents with a 3 day history of generalized
malaise, headache and stomach pain, followed by 1 day history of
lightheadedness and memory issues, found to have left temporal
hemorrhage.  History provided by patient's wife largely, this
patient is unable to provide much history due to mental status.

The patient was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior
to admission.  At that time, he told his wife he "caught a bug",
meaning he felt that he was developing a viral syndrome.  He
complained of generalized headache, nausea without vomiting,
nasal congestion, nonproductive cough and stomach ache.  No
fever, no chills, no visual changes.  He spent the next couple
days relaxing at home.  His symptoms began more severe on the
following day, with worsening headache and malaise.  On the day
of admission, the patient noted that his headache and nausea was
becoming more severe.  He also started to develop new symptoms 
of
lightheadedness and memory loss.  His wife first noticed this
because when she told him that he should see his doctor for 
these
symptoms, the patient was asking her who his doctor was.  This
was a notable change from his baseline, where he is fully awake,
alert, and aware of details such as this.  At this point, his
wife brought him to ___ for further 
evaluation.

At ___, initial vitals were notable for SBP
150s/90s, afebrile and otherwise normal. He received Hydralazine
10mg IV x2 for BPs in 150s. Exam was notable for "receptive
aphasia" and baseline R eye ptosis at that time per OSH ED
documentation without other focal deficits. He had noncontrast
___ CT performed which revealed a L temporal IPH. He also had a
CT chest performed due to his other symptoms after CXR revealed
question of R middle lobe opacities, which was unremarkable for
infection (revealing only lung nodules that should be followed
long-term). Patient was transferred to ___ for further
management.

On arrival to ___, vitals were notable for BP 176/67, HR 109,
otherwise unremarkable. His wife reports that the patient 
remains
far off from his baseline. He is disoriented, unable to recall
much recent history and inattentive.  

Of note, pt has history of MI s/p drug eluting stents x2 in 
___.
He was initially on aspirin and ___ but wife reports that
___ was discontinued several months after the procedure. He
has since been maintained on aspirin 81mg daily.

IMAGING
=========
-EKG ___: normal sinus rhythm

-CT Chest w/ contrast ___ (OSH): 
"1. Bilateral pleural nodularity with calcifications and sub 4mm
pulmonary nodules. These findings account for the rounded
opacities seen on today's CXR.  These findings are nonspecific
but can be seen with prior asbestos exposure. 
2. No focal airspace disease, effusion or pneumothorax." 

-Chest PA and Lateral ___ (OSH): Apparent two foci of 
rounded
opacities in the periphery of the right mid lung. 

-Noncontrast ___ CT ___: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
centered within the left middle cranial fossa appears stable as 
does
surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect. No new 
hemorrhage. Bleed is 2.5 x 3.9 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage 
centered within the left middle cranial fossa. 

-MR ___ w/ and w/o contrast ___
IMPRESSION:  
1. Large left temporal parenchymal hematoma is similar to ___ CTs allowing for differences in modalities, with 
stable mild mass effect.  
Relatively thin contrast enhancement along the margins of the 
hematoma is 
likely reactive, without clear evidence for an underlying mass.  
Amyloid 
angiopathy is the most likely diagnostic consideration in this 
age group.  
However, follow-up to exclude a mass is needed after resolution 
of blood 
products. 
2. No evidence for blood products elsewhere in the brain 
parenchyma. 
3. Probable trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in a sulcus between 
the occipital and posterior left temporal lobes. 
4. Extensive supratentorial white matter signal abnormalities 
are nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small vessel 
ischemic disease. 
5. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus and fluid in the 
left maxillary sinus.  Please correlate with associated 
symptoms. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with history of HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, and 
coronary artery disease s/p 2 drug eluting stents who presents 
with a 3 day history of generalized malaise, headache and 
stomach pain, followed by 1 day history of lightheadedness and 
memory
issues, found to have left temporal hemorrhage. His neurological 
examination was notable for transcortical sensory aphasia. 
Etiology likely hypertension given his history of elevated BPs 
at time of presentation and hemorrhage is intraparenchymal. 
Given slightly abnormal appearance on MRI, cannot completely 
rule out underlying malignancy. 

Acute Issue
=============
#Stroke: He was continued on his home verapamil and his losartan 
was increased from 25mg to 50mg with a goal SBP of 140-160. We 
held his home ASA and Lipitor in the setting of intracranial 
hemorrhage. ___ evaluated his functional status. MRI showed 
stable bleed so he was started on subQ heparin.

Chronic Issues
================
#Hypertension: We continued his home verapamil and increased his 
losartan from 25mg to 50mg.
#Hypothryoidism: We continued his home levothyroxine.

Transitional Issues
===================
-Repeat chest CT with contrast in 12 montha for small pulmunary 
nodules 
-Repeat MRI with and without contrast in 3 months to better 
visualize area of hemorrhage
-Start aspirin 81mg 10 days after discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache and memory 
loss resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel ruptures leading to decreased blood flow to 
brain. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia

We are changing your medications as follows:
-Increase Losartan from 25mg to 50mg

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
