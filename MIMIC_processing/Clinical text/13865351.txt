History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of bipolar II 
disorder (diagnosed in ___, one prior psychiatric 
hospitalization and no prior suicide attempts, recently 
evaluated in ___ on ___, presenting with daily, worsening 
intrusive, egodystonic suicidal thoughts, intense mood 
fluctuations, panic, anxiety, and paranoia.

Mr. ___ recently stopped his lithium (in ___, and a few 
months ago he also stopped seeing his outpatient treatment team 
due to insurance issues -- including his psychiatrist Dr. 
___ and his longtime therapist. Despite no longer 
being his active outpatient treater, former psychiatrist Dr. 
___ wrote a prescrcription for lithium 300 mg QAM and 
600 mg QHS to address symptoms. 

Mr. ___ presented to the ___ ED on ___ with similar 
symptoms as he does for this presentation. At that time, he went 
to ___. However, he now feels that his symptoms have 
worsened. In addition, he and his fiancée recently started 
wedding planning, and this has been a major stressor for him, as 
well as his concern that he is not contributing enough 
financially to their relationship. 

From Dr. ___ initial consult note on 
___: "During the initial interview in the ED, Mr. ___ 
reported worsening depressed mood, hopelessness, guilt, racing 
thoughts, impaired sleep for 1 weeks, and extreme mood lability 
leading to crying spells, irritability, or "fits of rage". He 
reports having physical "psychiatric pain" in his stomach when 
feeling particularly anxious which has been distressing for him 
and contributed to lack of sleep over the last week. His 
suicidal thoughts are egodystonic in nature, he has no intent or 
plan but reports having intrusive thoughts telling him to harm 
himself "right this minute" during his day. He has panic attacks 
following these thoughts. He also reports feeling like there is 
a demonic presence causing him physical discomfort and harm. He 
reported having visual "hallucinations", which he described as 
"flashes" of getting stabbed. He has no intent to harm himself 
or others but feels that this has impaired his ability to 
concentrate and complete simple tasks at home such as eating or 
showering. He reported numerous times "my executive function has 
worsened". He has not gone to work since ___. 

"Patient attempted to use mindfulness techniques, exercise, and 
deep breathing to decrease anxiety but this provided limited 
relief. He has had racing thoughts with increase in goal 
directed activity, urges to "buy a whole bunch of things at the 
store or my fiance... I get fixated on this". He reports that 2 
days prior he went to the supermarket and felt that a police 
officer was after him. He also reports hearing evil, maniacal 
laughter saying "I'm gonna get you", but feels that this is 
actually a voice in his head. He endorses some feelings of 
grandiosity and religiosity, stating that he had thoughts of 
wanting to give away all of his possession and live like ___. 
___. No other engagement in risky or impulsive behaviors 
reported. He reports having similar symptoms ___ years prior when 
he was hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric facility."

ED course also notable for two one-time doses of medications: 
lorazepam 1 mg for anxiety and agitation, and risperidone 0.5 mg 
for mania.

When seen by psychiatry upon arriving on the inpatient unit 
(evening of ___, Mr. ___ provides a history 
consistent with what has been reported above. He describes 
significant stress recently arising from: his own income, the 
fact that his income is smaller than his fiancée's income 
(causing him to feel he contributes less), his decision to get 
married (which he feels some uncertainty about), and wedding 
planning. Both he and his fiancée would prefer for him to be 
able to contribute more financially to their partnership. He 
also described significant concerns re: his ability to attach 
and commit to others (particularly his fiancée). He said he 
found a recent conversation with his therapist about these 
issues helpful, but that he wishes to explore and address them 
further. He states that at times he wants to disconnect from 
others, but at times he does want to connect. He also expressed 
significant guilt about sex with his fiancée, which he says 
stems from his religiousness. 

Mr. ___ denied any current intent or plan to harm himself, 
though he described daily intrusive suicidal ideation associated 
with panic attacks and physical pain centered on his trunk that 
is "so intense, I want to end my own life." He feels the pain is 
too severe and, "I can't endure this."

He denies any auditory or visual hallucinations. He did report, 
however, that he was "imagining" being stabbed, when he was 
experiencing his panic attacks associated with bodily pain. He 
also described pouring out Nyquil and saying aloud: "This looks 
like blood!" He also described an "internal voice" that he 
described as demonic -- laughing, and encouraging him to hurt 
himself -- but he said he thought this was his own voice, in his 
own control (so intrusive thoughts rather than auditory 
hallucinations). So he did not describe any frank hallucinations 
for me on evaluation (but please see Ms. ___ history 
included here above for a somewhat different report).

Brief Hospital Course:
DISCHARGE SUMMARY

1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
 On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission.  They were also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. Granted 
monitored access to sharps and deemed appropriate for group 
walks. No behavioral issues requiring security intervention or 
restraints. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
 #)  Bipolar disorder, current episode manic with psychotic 
features
 1) On presentation, patient endorsed depressive symptoms, 
impaired sleep for a week (sleeping ___ hours per night), 
impulsivity, increase in goal directed activity, egodystonic 
suicidal thoughts that are intrusive in nature, mood lability, 
intense anxiety. Patient also endorses paranoia, 
hyperreligiosity, feeling a demonic presence, and auditory 
hallucinations. On exam, patient was anxious appearing, calm, 
cooperative, thought process was at times vague, slowed but 
generally linear. 
 2) Diagnostically, presentation appeared consistent with 
underlying diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Current episode with 
mixed features of mania, suicidality, and psychosis. As patient 
has never experienced symptoms of psychosis before, favor 
diagnosis of mood disorder with psychotic features rather than 
primary psychotic or schizoaffective disorder. 
 3) Interventions included medication management, therapeutic 
intervention, family meeting, aftercare planning and 
psychoeducation. Patient was restarted on lithium, titrated to 
300mg po qAM + 900mg po qhs for acute mania ___ level 0.7, 
tolerated given concurrent risperidone). Risperidone was 
titrated to 2mg po qhs for psychosis and mood stabilization. He 
was placed on Ramelteon 8mg po qhs and lorazepam for sleep (max 
1mg, tapered to 0.25-0.5mg po qhs PRN). 
 4) Outcome: Over time, patient's thought process became more 
organized, hyper-religiosity decreased, suicidal thoughts/images 
resolved, and sleep improved. Patient reported fleeting 
intrusive suicidal thoughts without plan or intent, and engaged 
in safety planning to use coping skills, reach out to supports, 
or call ___. He endorsed significant improvement on medication 
regimen, tolerated with some sedation. Patient was 
future-oriented, planned to return to work and felt 
well-supported by family and fiancée. He voiced a desire to 
continue therapy and medication management upon discharge, and 
was amenable to partial hospitalization. 
 5) Recommendations: Continue to monitor for symptoms of mania 
and psychosis. Patient and family report a tendency for 
depressive episodes to follow mania/hypomania, so would closely 
monitor for depression and suicidal ideation. If depression 
worsens, could consider augmenting with lamotrigine, switching 
antipsychotic to quetiapine or Latuda, or consider switching 
lithium to depakote. Recommend continuing antipsychotic until 
mania and psychotic features resolved, and once a period of 
stability has been achieved for at least several weeks to 
months. Could consider dose decrease of risperidone if sedation 
fails to improve. Patient has previously had PRN Ativan without 
problematic use, but planned to discharge only with a short 
course of benzodiazepines for sleep; recommend discontinuing 
once euthymia and sleep stable. We believe lithium level is at 
an adequate dose (higher range of maintenance/lower range acute 
mania), but could consider further titration if patient does not 
continue to improve.  If patient does opt to discontinue lithium 
in the distant future (which we do not necessarily recommend), 
this should be done slowly under the supervision of a 
psychiatric prescriber. Abrupt discontinuation of lithium 
increases risk of relapse of major mood episode within 6 months 
(which is likely a precipitant in this presentation). 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS: No substance use needs.

4. MEDICAL: No acute medical needs.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
 #) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
 The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. Patient was visible, calm, and 
polite in milieu, but tended not to socialize with peers. He 
visited and spoke frequently with family or fiancée.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Family meeting in person with fiancée, brother, and mother (via 
phone). Collateral from father suggested patient discontinued 
medications not only due to insurance switch but due to some 
reservations about medications having been stable for so long. 
Explored with patient and he is now committed to medication 
adherence as part of his daily life. 

 #) INTERVENTIONS
 - Medications: lithium 300mg po qAM + 900mg po qhs, risperidone 
2mg po qhs, lorazepam 0.25-0.5mg po qhs PRN. Can continue 
melatonin OTC if helpful. 
 - Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and 
milieu therapy. Spiritual care.
 - Coordination of aftercare: Ar___ JP PHP, therapy and 
psychiatric referral
 - Behavioral Interventions: reality testing, problem solving  
 -Guardianships: None

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting risperidone (metabolic effects, sedation), lithium 
(thyroid dysfunction, renal dysfunction, toxicity, tremor), 
Ramelteon (sedation, hepatic metabolism), hydroxyzine, and 
lorazepam (sedation, respiratory depression, habit-forming) and 
risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medication, with this patient. We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any questions about medications 
with the treatment team.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
 On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon intrusive suicidal 
images and decreased reality-testing. Their static factors noted 
at that time included history of bipolar disorder, Caucasian 
male, prior psychiatric hospitalization. Modifiable risk factors 
included lack of outpatient providers and psychotropic regimen, 
poor reality-testing, decreased sleep, active mania/psychosis, 
psychic turmoil. These were addressed through medication 
management, therapeutic intervention, connection to aftercare.  
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including resolution of suicidal ideation, no 
prior suicide attempts, supportive relationship and family, 
spirituality, future-oriented, and help-seeking nature. Based on 
the totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is not 
at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.
