History of Present Illness:
___ year old male with hypertension (not on anti-hypertensives),
otherwise healthy, who presents with two weeks of constant
occipital headache and several hours of acute onset dizziness.
Transferred from ___ after being found to have multifocal
hypodensities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. 

Patient reports that over the past two weeks, he has had a
constant dull "pressure-type" headache, which starts at the base
of the skull and radiates ___. He has some relief with
Tylenol or NSAIDs, but then the headache will come back. It does
seem to be worse in the morning and then slowly improve over the
course of the day. He has noticed that it is worse with bending
forward. No nausea/vomiting. He does report that previously he
possibly had similar headaches, that lasted only a few days. One
was a few years ago, after he hit his head in a ___
accident. A few months ago again had a few days of headache 
after
he was hit on the head with a tree limb. He denies LOC with
either head strike; only required stitches.

Today he was cutting down a tree with a chainsaw when he had
acute onset vertigo, with a spinning sensation. He suddenly had
trouble standing up and had to hold onto things to shuffle
around. This occurred at 10 am. 

He presented to ___, where he had a CT/CTA notable for
multifocal hypodensities in the right cerebellum. He was
transferred here for further work-up.

Here, he reports that his dizziness is improving, but he still
feels dizzy with sitting or walking. Headache is not prominent.

otherwise healthy, who presents with two weeks of constant
occipital headache and several hours of acute onset dizziness.
Transferred from ___ after being found to have multifocal
hypodensities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. 

MRI showed "Patchy evolving early subacute infarctions in the 
posterior inferior cerebellar hemisphere, with overall moderate 
volume." 
LDL was 160, HbA1c 5.5. Patient started on aspirin 81 mg and 
atorvastatin 40 mg. 
On ___, patient had episode of orthostatic hypotension when 
standing. SBP dropped by 70 mmHg; sinus bradycardia to ___. On 
___, patient dizzy upon sitting up quickly, with bradycardia 
down to ___, 40s. Unclear why patient had vagal episodes. 
Dizziness resolved and right beating nystagmus resolved. Patient 
was able to walk with a very mild veer to the right on 
heel-to-toe walk. Slightly slower on rapid alternating movements 
on R hand. 

Chronic vertebral dissection suspected due to history of 
head/neck trauma but no evidence of dissection seen on MRA head 
neck with fat saturation. TTE shows mild symmetric LV 
hypertrophy but no evident cause for embolism or syncope seen. 

TEE done; no acute findings, no PFO or ASD on prelim. 
Patient discharged on ___ of ___ holter monitor to monitor 
for arrhythmia. 

Etiology of multifocal infarcts still unclear. Malignancy and 
infection considered but no supporting systemic symptoms. 
Autoimmune/inflammatory causes considered; CRP and ESR negative. 


Transitional issues: 
[]f/u holter event monitor 
[]f/u TEE report
[]may need to start antihypertensives with still hypertensive
[]f/u with neurology; already has appointment
[]continue to work up cause for infarction
[]needs to be referred to a sleep specialist/sleep study to 
evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness resulting 
from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a 
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  
 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 High blood pressure
 High cholesterol 
 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 START atorvastatin
 START aspirin
 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
