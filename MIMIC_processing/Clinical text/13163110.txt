Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo F with hx decompensated cirrhosis, HCV, 
systolic CHF with EF of 45-50% on last TTE, p/w generalized 
weakness and elevated LFTs. 

# Weakness: reassuringly, no focal deficits and no clear 
infectious process noted on arrival.  Pt states that this has 
been going on for almost a year now and may represent 
progression of her decompensated cirrhosis vs. orthostatic 
hypotension given her borderline low BP's noted on vitals off 
all home anti-hypertensives.  Given no clinical sxs of UTI and 
negative urine culture abx were not continued for UTI.  ___ saw 
pt and felt that she would benefit from rehab placement. Her 
antihypertensives were held on admission and spironolactone 
restarted on HD1. Lasix was restarted prior to discharge. 

# Elevated LFT's/decompensated cirrhosis:  Pt transferred from 
___ for CBD dilation but she did not have clear history of 
new abdominal pain and no RUQ tenderness on exam.  EUS was 
performed on ___ which negative for any bile duct obstruction. 
 Diagnostic para was also done on ___ as not c/w SBP. LFT's 
improved without further intervention.  It was felt that 
elevated LFT's were likely ___ underlying HCV and cirrhosis and 
were stable from prior lab work at her gastroenterologists in 
___ of this year.  She was continued on home sprinolactone and 
restarted on 20 mg home Lasix as she had some signs of volume 
overload on history and exam (reported worsening DOE and 
significant ___ edema noted on exam). She had no evidence of 
hepatic encephalopathy. Limited exam of esophagus on EGD/EUS did 
not reveal varices. 

# HTN: Held home metoprolol and lisinopril for borderline low 
BP's on admission. Metoprolol restarted on discharge.

# Hypomagnesemia: Patient with low magnesium to 1.3, repleted on 
___. Likely related to holding her home magnesium supplement. 
She will need repeat magnesium on ___. 

# Pancytopenia: Pt noted to have pancytopenia with WBC in the 
2's, Hb ~9, and platelet's in the 40's-60's range.  These values 
were similar to prior CBC in ___ and are likely related 
to her underlying cirrhosis. 
 
# GERD: continued home PPI.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[] Held home lisinopril on discharge as BPs noted to be low 
during admission. Can consider restarting pending BP as 
outpatient.  
[]Please follow-up peritoneal fluid culture from ___ and blood 
culture from ___
[]f/u final MRCP read
[]Please repeat CBC with diff and chemistries for Cr and Mg on 
___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came in with weakness and elevated liver enzymes.  We did a 
procedure to look for any infection in the fluid around your 
belly and this was negative.  You also underwent an endoscopy to 
look for a blockage in your bile duct and this was negative as 
well.

We think that your weakness and your progressive fatigue is 
related to a worsening of your underlying liver condition.  
Please continue to discuss with your outpatient doctors about 
starting a treatment for your hepatitis C.  You were also found 
to have a low blood pressure and so your lisinopril was stopped 
as low blood pressure can contribute to your falls and feeling 
of weakness. 

Please call your doctor if you experience worsening shortness of 
breath, abdominal discomfort, yellowing of your eyes, worsening 
swelling in your legs, bloody vomiting or bloody or black stools 
or any other symptoms that concern you.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your ___ Care Team
