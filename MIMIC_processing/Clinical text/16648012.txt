Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
right flank pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a history of
CKDIII and kidney stones, who presented with acute onset of 
right
flank pain consistent with a kidney stone, admitted for
management of ___. The patient was in his normal state of health
until late ___ night, when he was awoken with severe right
flank pain radiating to his groin -- so severe that he vomited
several times. This was the same pain as the previous kidney
stone (also in the right). He denies fevers and chills, other
urinary symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath. He did not
have any diarrhea. The pain was colicky in nature, though never
fully went away. He presented to the emergency room; shortly
after presenting to the ED, his pain had resolved. Of note,
furosemide was recently started in the past two weeks by his 
PCP.

In the ED, SBP elevated from the 150s-180s. Otherwise vital 
signs
were stable.  CT urogram was performed whih showed:

 
1. New mild right hydroureteronephrosis without urolithiasis
detected. 
Differential considerations include a recently passed calculus,
but other 
obstructing processes are not excluded including malignancy.
Recommend urology 
consultation, correlation with urine cytology and consider
follow-up CTU with 
intravenous contrast or MRU to further assess for source of an
obstructing 
process if needed. 
2. Asymmetric perinephric fat stranding on the right may be
related to the 
right-sided hydroureteronephrosis, but the possibility of
pyelonephritis. 
Recommend correlation with urinalysis to exclude infection. 
3. Possible partially calcified 2 cm lesion at the
gastroesophageal junction. 
Recommend correlation with nonemergent endoscopy. 
4. Additional incidental findings include cholelithiasis,
diverticulosis, a 
small bowel containing right inguinal hernia without 
obstruction,
moderate 
prostatomegaly, and a possible chronic appearing short-segment
left common 
iliac artery dissection. 

1. Recommend urology consultation, correlation with urine
cytology and 
consider follow-up CT or MR urography to assess for the source 
of
the 
right-sided hydroureteronephrosis if needed. 
2. Correlation with urinalysis. 
3. Non-emergent endoscopy for further assessment of partly
calcified lesion at 
the gastroesophageal junction. 

A renal ultrasound was performed, which showed:

1.  Increased echogenicity of the renal cortices and loss of
corticomedullary 
differentiation bilaterally compatible with medical renal
disease.  No 
hydronephrosis on either side. 
2.  Interval enlargement of a right lower pole simple appearing
renal cyst. 
3.  Post void residual insignificant. 

BMP was notable for a creatinine of 2.5 (1.9 at PCP follow up
last week). 

Of note, vascular surgery was consulted because of an
incidentally found left iliac artery dissection -- they
recommended long term (not acute) blood pressure management to
target SBP < 140, initiation of aspirin and statin, and CT
angiogram when his kidneys have improved.

Because creatinine did not improve, he was admitted to medicine.

 
Past Medical History:
1. CKD3

IMAGING:

Renal ultrasound:

1. Redemonstration of mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney 
which is new 
compared to the prior study of ___.  No etiology for 
obstruction 
identified.  No left hydronephrosis. 
2. No significant change in appearance of the renal parenchyma, 
including 
increased echogenicity of the renal cortices and loss of 
corticomedullary 
differentiation, compatible with medical renal disease. 
3. Slight interval enlargement of 7.4 cm simple cyst arising 
from the lower 
pole right kidney. 
4. 1.4 cm cortical cyst within the posterior upper pole of the 
right kidney.  
Adjacent punctate echogenic focus could represent wall 
calcification although 
this is not clearly corroborated on the recent CT. 

CTU:

1. Recommend urology consultation, correlation with urine 
cytology and 
consider follow-up CT or MR urography to assess for the source 
of the 
right-sided hydroureteronephrosis if needed. 
2. Correlation with urinalysis. 
3. Non-emergent endoscopy for further assessment of partly 
calcified lesion at 
the gastroesophageal junction. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, the patient's flank pain had passed. However, his 
creatinine continued to climb, from a baseline creatinine of 
1.9, to a maximum of 3.3 on HD#3. A repeat renal ultrasound was 
obtained, which showed only continued mild hydronephrosis and 
hydroureter, consistent with a passed stone. His lisinopril and 
furosemide were held, and he was started on amlodipine 10 mg. 
His metoprolol was held as well, and he was placed on labetalol 
to target an SBP < 130. Because of his continuously rising 
creatinine, nephrology was consulted, who spun his urine and saw 
muddy brown casts, consistent with ATN -- likely in the setting 
of ACE-I and loop diuretic use, hydronephrosis from the stone, 
underlying CKD, and contrast administration. On day of 
discharge, his creatinine downtrended. Therefore, he will follow 
up with Dr. ___ a week and recheck his BMP at that time; 
if his creatinine has resolved, he will stop amlodipine and 
restart his lisinopril. Non-urgent renal consultation for 
recurrent kidney stones is recommended as well.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

# Suspect left iliac artery aneurysm. This was potentially seen 
on the CT urogram in the ED; vascular was consulted. They did 
not think that a CTU was an ideal study to assess, and 
recommended a CTA of the LLE. This was deferred given his kidney 
injury and lack of symptoms. He would have a non-urgent CTA of 
the LLE as an outpatient after his kidney injury resolves. In 
the meantime, he was started on ASA 81 mg and atorvastatin 40. 
These can be stopped if the CT scan is negative.

# HTN.
- amlodipine 10 mg daily
- continue home metoprolol
- HOLD lisinopril and furosemide until follow up with Dr. ___

___ ISSUES
- follow up BMP; if creatinine returns to ___, STOP 
amlodipine and RESTART lisinopril and furosemide
- non-urgent renal referral for recurrent stones
- non-urgent CTA of LLE when kidney injury resolves; can stop 
ASA and statin if not aneurysm

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a kidney stone, and 
kidney injury after. This was due to "acute tubular necrosis." 
You were monitored until your kidney injury improved. You will 
have to HOLD your lisinopril and furosemide until your kidney 
improves completely. In the meantime, you will take a new type 
of blood pressure medication called amlodipine. However, when 
your kidney is better you should switch back to lisinopril; you 
will see Dr. ___ week to go over this.
 
Followup Instructions:
