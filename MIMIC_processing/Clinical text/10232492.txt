enlargement, no obvious signs of ischemia (new or old)

Right upper quadrant ultrasound from ___ 
reviewed,
"Impression: Multiple gallstones in the gallbladder as well as
diffuse colon wall thickening.  These findings can be seen with
cholecystitis, however there is no fluid around the gallbladder
making the slightly less specific.  HIDA scan could be used for
more specific evaluation if clinically indicated."

MRCP from ___ also reviewed, "Impression: 1 there
is mild to moderate dilation of the biliary tree.  2. 2 adjacent
filling defects measuring up to 6 mm are seen in the dilated
common bile duct adjacent to the ampulla likely representing
stones.  3. Gallbladder contains multiple stones and show
surrounding fluid suspicious for cholecystitis.  Possible cystic
duct stone identified measuring up to 5 mm.  Clinical 
correlation
is recommended."

___ ERCP report:
A small periampullary diverticulum just distal to the ampulla.
Successful biliary cannulation was achieved with the
sphincterotome.
Two round stones that were causing partial obstruction were 
seen
at the biliary tree. There was post-obstructive dilation. 
Biliary sphincterotomy was performed. Because of the location 
of
a nearby diverticulum, sphincterotomy could not be completed
satisfactorily without risking cautery to adjacent duodenal 
wall.
Therefore, a 8mm balloon was introduced for sphincteroplasty and
the diameter was progressively increased to 10 mm successfully.
2 stones and a small amount of sludge were extracted
successfully using a balloon. Subsequent completion 
cholangiogram
was normal. 
Okay also recommendations: NPO overnight with aggressive IV
hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr
No aspirin, plavix, NSAIDS, coumadin for 5 days
If no abdominal pain in the AM, advance diet to clear liquids
and then advance as tolerated.
Surgical consult re: cholecystectomy timing

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with no significant past medical history 
admitted with gallstone pancreatitis on admission the patient 
was put n.p.o., IV fluids and ERCP team was consult. the patient 
had ERCP where Two round stones that were causing partial 
obstruction were seen at the biliary tree. There was 
post-obstructive dilation. The CBD, CHD, and intrahepatics were 
well-visualized. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing 
guidewire.
Because of the location of a nearby diverticulum, sphincterotomy 
could not be completed satisfactorily without risking cautery to 
adjacent duodenal wall. Therefore, a 8mm balloon was introduced 
for sphincteroplasty and the diameter was progressively 
increased to 10 mm successfully. 2 stones and a small amount of 
sludge were extracted successfully using a balloon. Subsequent 
completion cholangiogram was normal.

___ to 250.
