Chief Complaint:
Right breast cancer
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIGHT BREAST LUMPECTOMY AND AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION. 
LYMPHATICOVENOUS AXILLARY BYPASS RIGHT x 1; lymphangiogram

 
History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ woman who
presented with a right breast invasive ductal carcinoma.  The
patient had a palpable lump, which we initially thought may
have been a cyst.  Core needle biopsy of the mass confirmed
the malignancy.  She also had a positive fine-needle
aspiration of the ipsilateral lymph node.  The patient received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with some demonstrated response in
the breast.  The right axillary node had remained palpable. 
Therefore, shared decision making was to pursue a right
lumpectomy with axillary node dissection.  Lymphatic bypass is
being performed to help reduce the risk of lymphedema.  Of
note, the patient denies family history of breast or ovarian
cancer.
