Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented after transfer from an outside hospital 
with complaint of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. She was 
found to have LFT elevation and acute pancreatitis with her RUQ 
ultrasound showing features concerning for choledocholithiasis. 
She underwent ERCP on ___ with sphincterotomy and stone 
extraction. Her pain improved and her abnormal LFTs/lipase 
down-trended over the next two days as she was treated with 
bowel rest, IV fluid hydration, and pain control. Given the 
improvement in her clinical status, she was then taken to the 
operating room on ___ for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the 
acute care surgery service.  Please see operative report for 
details of this procedure. She tolerated the procedure well and 
was extubated upon completion. She was subsequently taken to the 
PACU for recovery. Her vital signs were routinely monitored and 
she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was 
initially given IV fluids postoperatively, which were 
discontinued when she was tolerating PO's. Her diet was advanced 
the evening after surgery, which she tolerated without abdominal 
pain, nausea, or vomiting. She was voiding adequate amounts of 
urine without difficulty. She was encouraged to mobilize out of 
bed and ambulate as tolerated, which she was able to do 
independently. Her pain level was routinely assessed and well 
controlled at discharge with an oral regimen as needed. She was 
discharged home the evening after her surgery with scheduled 
follow up in ___ clinic in two weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o In two days (___), you may shower and remove the 
gauzes over your incisions. Under these dressing you have small 
plastic bandages called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips 
for 2 weeks. (These are the thin paper strips that might be on 
your incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

take, please call your surgeon.
