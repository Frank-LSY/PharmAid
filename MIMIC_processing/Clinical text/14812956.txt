IMAGING
=======
___ CTA H/N:
1. Redemonstration of 1.2 cm right thalamic intraparenchymal 
hematoma with 
mild surrounding edema and no midline shift. 
2. Approximately 60% stenosis of the proximal left internal 
carotid artery by NASCET criteria. 
3. No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm, dissection or 
vascular 
malformation.

___ ___:
OSH head CT showed acute right thalamic hemorrhage.

___ CXR: 
OSH CXR with no acute pulmonary process.
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o right handed man with history of HTN who 
was transferred to ___ from ___ after presenting with 
L-sided plegia and numbness with NCHCT revealing a R thalamic 
hemorrhage. 

Hospital course by system:  

# Neuro: Right thalamic bleed etiology most likely secondary to 
hypertension vs AVM. He was evaluated with CTA head and neck in 
ED showed right thalamic intraparenchymal hematoma with mild 
surrounding edema, no midline shift and 60% stenosis of the 
proximal LT ICA. MRI brain w/wo contrast scheduled outpatient in 
6 weeks. We have ASA, NSAIDs, and any other anti-platelet 
agents. Blood pressure was well controlled with minimal 
interventions for a goal of SBP < 140. Worked with ___ who 
recommended discharge home with home ___.
 
# CV: Has known history of HTN, HLD, and TWI on EKG. On 
admission troponins were trended and negative. He was monitored 
on telemetry. We continued his home HCTZ 25mg PO daily and 
started captopril 12.5 TID, which was then transitioned to 
lisinopril 5mg daily. We have held his statin in the setting of 
his hemorrhage, may resume as outpatient once discussed with his 
PCP. 
 
# ENDO: Has known type 2 diabetes. Blood sugars were monitored 
while he continued his home metformin. HbA1c was 6.7%. 

===================
Transitional issues
===================
1. Holding Aspirin and statin.
2. Adding lisinopril 5mg for better BP control.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left sided weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE thalamic hemorrhage in your brain. We 
think the cause is your high blood pressure. We have monitored 
you with a head CT and have ordered an MRI in 6 weeks.

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all 
the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being 
deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of 
symptoms.
  
A hemorrhage can have many different causes, so we assessed you 
for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having 
stroke or hemorrhage. In order to prevent future bleeds, we plan 
to modify those risk factors. We are changing your medications 
as follows: holding the aspirin and statin for 2 weeks please 
resume when seen by your PCP, we have added a blood pressure 
medication called lisinopril 5mg oral daily. 

Instructions: 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
