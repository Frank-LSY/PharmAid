Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after a  Laparoscopic Sigmoid 
Colectomy for surgical management of your persistent smoldering 
diverticulitis. You have recovered from this procedure well and 
you are now ready to return home. Samples from your colon were 
taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department 
for analysis. You will receive these pathology results at your 
follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the 
surgeon to contact you regarding these results they will contact 
you before this time. You have tolerated a regular diet, are 
passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by 
mouth. You may return home to finish your recovery.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patientÂ’s to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call 
the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: 
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or extended constipation.  
 
You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures and a skin glue called 
Dermabond. These are healing well however it is important that 
you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness of the incision lines, 
white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the 
incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or 
swelling of the area. Please call the office if you develop any 
of these symptoms or a fever. You may go to the emergency room 
if your symptoms are severe.  

You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. 
The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with 
steri-strips (little white adhesive strips) instead of 
Dermabond, these will fall off over time, please do not remove 
them. Please no baths or swimming for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team.
 
You will be prescribed narcotic pain medication oxycodone. This 
medication should be taken when you have pain and as needed as 
written on the bottle. This is not a standing medication. You 
should continue to take Tylenol for pain around the clock and 
you can also take Advil. Please do not take more than 3000mg of 
Tylenol in 24 hours. Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic 
pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car while 
taking narcotic pain medication.
