IMAGING:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. At L3-L4 a left central disc extrusion with 1.4 cm superior 
migration 
results in moderate spinal canal narrowing, impinging on the 
exiting left L3 
nerve root.  Moderate to severe left neural foraminal narrowing 
and crowding 
of the left subarticular zone is also noted. 
2. Additional degenerative changes at L4-L5 results in moderate 
left and mild 
to moderate right neural foraminal narrowing and at L5-S1 
results in moderate 
severe left-greater-than-right neural foraminal narrowing. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with a past medical history of
hyperlipidemia, obesity, admitted with 1 month of progressive
constipation, and 1 day of back pain radiating to his L leg
concerning for acute spinal pathology

# Lower back pain radiating to L leg - distribution would be
consistent with L3-L4 herniation; given his job description
involves prolonged sitting, prolonged bending over, and heaving
lifting, may be occupational; extent of pain is what is
concerning to me, as he received many medications in the ED
without improvement in his symptoms (and he is opiate naÃ¯ve per
my review of prescription monitoring database by prior provider)
- MRI L-spine: showed L3-L4 a left central disc extrusion with 
1.4 cm superior migration  results in moderate spinal canal 
narrowing.  Discussed findings with orthopedics, and will plan 
for ___, analgesics and f/u in ___ weeks.  Verbalized this plan 
to patient and his family.
-Naproxen 500mg BID with meals x 14 days
