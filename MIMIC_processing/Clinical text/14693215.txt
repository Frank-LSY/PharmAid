IMAGING:
========

___ - RUQ ultrasound
1.  No acute findings.  
2.  Mild fatty liver.  Echogenic liver consistent with 
steatosis. Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver 
disease including steatohepatitis or significant hepatic 
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study. 

Microbiology
=============
___: HCV VIRAL LOAD (Pending)
___: HBV Viral Load (Pending)
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hypertension, allergic rhinitis, recent E. coli UTI on 
nitrofurantoin since ___ who presented with malaise, chills, 
fevers, dizziness, and found to have 
Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia.

# Drug-induced liver injury
-Underlying steatosis seen on RUQ ultrasound, likely predisposed 
to worse injury from nitrofurantoin. No coagulopathy. Pt took 5 
day course of azithromycin 3 weeks prior to presentation, 
however correlation of LFT improvement with nitrofurantoin 
cessation as well as pattern of injury are consistent with DILI 
from nitrofurantoin. Hepatitis B non-immune, HCV serology 
negative. Autoimmune studies pending at discharge as well as 
HCV/HBV viral loads. HgA1C normal. Unlikely hemochromatosis 
given prior normal iron studies.

# UTI
- E. coli on culture, still symptomatic on admission. Completed 
ceftriaxone 1g q24H x 3 days. Phenazopyrimidine for symptomatic 
relief.

# Anxiety: Well controlled on her current medication regimen of 
sertraline 100mg and lorazepam 1mg PO QID PRN
-initially held due to potential 
transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia side effect, but restarted 
after recovery and no subsequent worsening of LFTs observed

# Headache - likely tension, responded to ibuprofen 400mg x1

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-nitrofurantoin listed as allergy in OMR, caused hepatocellular 
pattern of injury
-check LFTs with PCP ___ to evaluate for continued resolution
-outpatient hepatology follow-up for steatosis
-The following labs were pending at discharge:
 ___, ANTI-MITOCHONDRIAL ANTIBODY, ANTI-SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODY
 IgG, IMMUNOLOGY HBV Viral Load, IMMUNOLOGY HCV VIRAL LOAD
-Full code
-No HCP, pt wishes fiancÃ© ___ ___ and daughter 
___ ___ to be in agreement on medical 
decisions
-recommend ongoing discussion of HCP
