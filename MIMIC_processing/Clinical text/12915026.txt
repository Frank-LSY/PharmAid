History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old ___
freshman with a psychiatric history of depression and eating
disorder and past medical history of ___
syndrome, who was brought to ___ ___ by ___ police
after voicing suicidal ideation. Pt reports that she has been
dealing with thoughts of being "tired of life" since her early
teens. These thoughts have been worsening in the past 6 months
since arriving to ___ from ___ for college. She has been
having intermittent thoughts of overdosing with nonspecific 
pills
or jumping off a building. Reports she has never picked a
particular building or "rehearsed" by going to a roof. For the
last 6 months, most of her suicidal thoughts have been centered
on overdosing with nonspecific pills, but recently these 
thoughts
began to center around jumping off a building. Denies that she
ever intended to carry out these thoughts and never set a date.  


She has been struggling since starting college. Feels like she
doesn't really "click" with people, that most of her peers are
interested in partying/drinking. However, when she does meet
peers that aren't into partying/drinking, she still feels like
she can't form a significant connection to them. Feels lonely 
but
wonders if she's too judgmental of others and lazy when
initiating new relationships. She was hopeful about the new
semester, having changed her major from ___ administration
to health sciences, but soon found herself dealing with ongoing
depressed/anxious mood, low energy, loss of enjoyment in leisure
activities, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation with a 
plan
but no intent (as described above). Found herself questioning 
the
quality of the ___ lectures. Preferred to stay home
instead of interacting/working with others, which she considered
a hassle/tedious, although pt reports that's she's always been
more shy and introverted. She wanted to take time off school and
focus on her mental health. Her mother seemed to be supportive 
of
the decision a few days ago, and pt was feeling well. However,
last night, pt had a significant argument with her mother
regarding taking time off. Mother told pt that she wasn't trying
hard enough. Pt was devastated and experienced renewed suicidal
thoughts of jumping off a building. 

Additionally, pt has been dealing with an eating disorder since
___ (diagnosed in ___. Around that time, she was
binging/restricting/purging. Reports she is better now, able to
eat ___. Last episode of self-induced vomiting was on
___. She still consistently reads calorie
labels and is afraid of checking her weight. She used laxatives
last ___, 1 laxative/day for 1 wk in order to treat
constipation and because she felt better when her stomach was
empty. Restarted laxative use this week (___) to treat
constipation. 

Pt was started on Prozac ___ by psychiatry at ___. She
stopped it after thinking that it wasn't very effective. She
restarted it again this year at a higher dose (40 mg daily). At
this dose, she felt happier and more stable but thought it was
also "artificial." Says that she had a lot of thoughts in her
head but without the proper emotions. For example, she had many
thoughts about school and her responsibilities without the
associated stress. She also didn't feel guilty about her binging
and was not restricting. She considered these two situations
"unnatural."  

Upon arrival to the unit, pt was very anxious and tearful and
stated that "I don't belong here," that being on the unit has
been a "wake up call." She is afraid that being on the unit will
make her feel worse and really wants to go back to her 
dormitory.
Denies current SI/HI/AVH. 

Denies any substance use, history of manic symptoms (decreased
need for sleep with increased energy, impulsive behaviors,
pressured speech, grandiosity), OCD behaviors
(obsessions/compulsions), excessive anxiety with physical
symptoms of palpitations/diaphoresis when meeting new people or
presenting in large groups of people.

Reports mild abdominal bloating, intermittent, since she started
a vegan diet ~3 weeks ago. Denies fever, chills, night sweats,
headache, chest pain, SOB, palpitations, dizziness, fainting,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea. 

___ Course: Patient was cooperative and did not require
physical/chemical restraints. 

Additional HPI per Dr. ___ consult note:

___ is a ___ year-old woman (NEU Freshman) with a 
history
of depression and an eating disorder who was brought to the ___ 
by
___ Police after voicing suicidal ideation. She has 
been
having these thoughts increasingly over the past month. She has
considered jumping off of a building or overdosing on her
medications, which include Prozac and an unknown medication from
___ for her eating disorder (used to reduce cravings, but she
no longer takes it). She was placed on Prozac by NEUHS in 
___ but abruptly discontinued it a few weeks ago because it 
felt
artificial. Regarding her SI, she has not rehearsed by selecting
a building and/or going up to a rooftop, but she has paid
attention to different buildings and wondered if they are high
enough and secluded enough to be appropriate for jumping off of;
she believes the building should be at least 6 stories high.

The suicidal ideation comes in the context of increasing 
symptoms
of depression. Over the past month or so, she has had increasing
difficulty sleeping (problems with both hypersomnia and 
insomnia,
more insomnia over the past few days), wavering energy, 
decreased
motivation (stopped going to class regularly over the past 
month,
completely stopped over the past week), low self-esteem, and
decreased ability to concentrate. She has fallen behind in
classes and now has failing grades in them, whereas she had
mostly As last semester. She has also been skipping all
appointments at ___ this semester in avoidance 
of
discussing her thoughts.

She was born in ___ but moved to ___ at age ___, where she
lived and went to high school until ___. She says her
problems started in senior year in high school after she had a
fight with her boyfriend's younger sister. The two of them were
traveling on college visits with 2 other guys, and the patient
became upset that the BF's younger sister seemed to prefer to
hang out with the guys than with her. The patient then became
very quiet around the group, which irritated them. The younger
sister and her family are very influential in the high school,
and upon returning to high school, rumors were spread about the
patient. The patient felt as if the whole school had turned
against her, including her boyfriend and her boyfriend's family;
this led to feelings of social isolation and a distrust of her
peers. The issues later resolved after explaining her side of 
the
story to her boyfriend and his family, but the feelings of
distrust propagated forward. She then had a difficult transition
to life in ___ and to college in general. She started out as 
a
major in ___ administration but felt as if it was not what
she wanted to do, though she did well. She switched to health
sciences, which she enjoys much more but still feels like she
should be dealing with her mental health issues instead of
focusing on school. She thinks she should return to ___ for a
year and get her life in order before returning to school.

Her mother and father are divorced. The mother is in ___ while
the father is in ___. She has told both sides of the family
about her depression. While they are supportive about her 
seeking
care, she says they (particularly her mother and paternal
grandmother) have started to tell her that other people have
"real" problems and more difficult lives, and that she should
"just get over" her depression. 

On Psychiatric ROS, she denies symptoms of mania, including
periods of insomnia with increased energy and elevated mood,
grandiosity, and impulsive behaviors. She denies symptoms of
psychosis, including perceptual disturbances, paranoia, and 
other
delusions. She denies nightmares but sometimes has flashbacks to
her mother punishing her (see below).

She endorses a history of eating disorder. This started out as
weight loss in the context of what she says was depression in
___. She realized that it "felt good" to see her weight go 
down,
so she started to restrict her portion size to continue losing
weight. Her mother interfered and began to feed her. She began 
to
restrict food groups outside of her mother's meals ___, fats,
proteins/meats), but her mother adapted to that as well. She
eventually started skipping meals altogether. She lost nearly 40
lbs through her efforts. Her behaviors evolved into chewing &
spitting, which led to binging, which led to vomiting following
binging. In ___, she saw someone who served as both a 
therapist
and Psychiatrist. She says she has gained back her weight over 
at
least the past year. Currently, she skips meals but then binges.
More recently, she has been skipping meals and binging, but not
vomiting. She has been afraid to check her weight, so does not
know it.
