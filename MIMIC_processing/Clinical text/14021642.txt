Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M who presented to ___ emergency 
department s/p fall with a syncopal episode. CT images showed 
left maxillary sinus and bilateral pterygoid plate fracture, ___ 
___ Type II fractures, and two front teeth fractures. He was 
admitted to the ___/trauma service. ___ was consulted and 
recommended chlorhexadine oral rinse BID and outpatient follow 
up with his dentist and the ___ clinic. Plastic surgery was

precautions and follow up with plastic surgery clinic in 1 week. 
Ophthalmology was consulted for the orbital fracture and 
recommended non-urgent follow up with his local ophthalmologist 
within 3 months. His urine culture was negative for infection. 
Troponin levels were checked related to syncope and negative and 
his chest x-ray was unremarkable.On HD2, a neck CTA was obtained 
and showed patent carotid and vertebral arteries with no  
evidence of stenosis.  The patient remained hemodynamically 
stable and was admitted to the floor for further management. Per 
the patient, he had recently undergone an extensive syncope work 
up at an outside hospital and was followed closely by his 
primary care provider. Therefore, further syncope workup at this 
time was not deemed necessary and the patient plans follow up 
with his doctor.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was well controlled with acetaminophen and 
oxycodone.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Orthostatic 
vital signs were within normal limit.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was able to tolerate a soft regular diet. 
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan. Follow up appointments were

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after injuries sustained for a fall. 
CT imaging revealed facial fractures and damage to your teeth. 
The oral and maxillofacial surgery team was consulted and 
recommended no surgery at this time and you should follow up in 
1 week in their clinic. You also have injury to your teeth which 
you should see your general dentist for further repair. The 
plastic surgery team was consulted for your facial fractures and 
recommended sinus precautions and outpatient follow up to 
discuss surgery once your swelling is improved. Since you had 
injury around your eye, the ophthalmology service evaluated your 
and your vision is intact. You should follow up with your local 
ophthalmologist on a non-urgent basis within 3 months. Your fall 
was the result  of a syncopal episode. Because of your recent 
medical work up for this issue, it does not need to be repeated 
at this time. Please follow up with your primary care provider.

You are doing well and ready to go home to continue your 
recovery. Please note the following discharge instructions.

Sinus Precautions:
Certain precautions will assist healing and we ask that you 
faithfully follow these instructions:

1. Take the prescribed medications as directed.

2. Do not forcefully spit for several days.

3. Do not smoke for several days.

4. Do not use straws for several days.

5. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even 
though your sinus may feel stuffy or there may be some nasal 
drainage.

6. Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If 
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

7. Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew 
on the opposite side of your mouth.

8. Do not rinse vigorously for several days. GENTLE salt water 
swishes may be used. Slight bleeding from the nose is not 
uncommon for several days after the surgery. Please keep our 
office advised of any changes in your condition, especially if 
drainage or pain increases. It is important that you keep all 
future appointments until this condition has resolved.
