CT from ___:
 1. Increased, right periorbital inflammation. Bony defects in
the right medial orbital wall and orbital roof are new from 
prior
and suggest extension of infection from the paranasal sinuses.
Phlegmon and infection involve the extraconal fat along the
medial and superior aspect of the globe. No drainable fluid
collection.
 2. Extensive opacification of the frontal sinus and ethmoid air
cells, which appears mildly increased in comparison to the prior
examination. Hyperdense material within the right frontal sinus,
again raises the possibility of fungal colonization. Bilateral
maxillary mucosal thickening is also mildly increased and there
is obstruction of the ostiomeatal units, bilaterally. 
 3. Large right maxillary premolar periapical lucency ___ 
4)with
anterior cortical breakthrough, unchanged from the prior
examination.
