History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old M w/ hx of L intracranial AV fistula s/p
repair ___ years ago who presents with Subacute course of L eye
pain. Hx obtained from pt at bedside.

Pt states that over the last 3 months he has experienced L eye
pain, preorbital in region and throbbing in nature. He describes
as daily and episodic, with episodes having increased in 
duration
more recently. Pain can at times involve L temporal region and 
be
accompanied by "pins" in his eyes. With these sx, pt has also
experienced horizontal diplopia, specifically when looking left
and looking up. Binocular in nature and unsure if worse with 
near
or far gaze. Is certain that his L eye does not abduct as well 
as
it should. He has additionally experienced an episodic sensation
of swelling in his eye, which may be accompanied by a "haziness"
in his visual fields. Pt saw Ophthmo 2 days prior to 
presentation
who initially ordered outpt MRI for evaluation. However, due to
his eye pain worsening pt presented to ED for further 
evaluation.

Denies associated pain with eye movements, facial tingling,
dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, or hearing loss/tinnitus. No
other headaches, neck pain, or sensorimotor deficits. No recent
infxn or trauma. Unaware of any similar sx in R eye. 

Pt's previous AV fistula was first discovered when pt was ___
years and suffered head injury after fighting with his brother.
He noticed "swishing" in his head as well as similar sx to
present. Upon identification of fistula (pt cannot say where in
head it was), pt underwent repair at ___ in ___.
Pt states he has generally been asymptomatic since that time. 
states that sx are markedly similar to those experienced 

Neuro and General ROS negative except as noted above

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old M with a h/o of L intracranial AV 
fistula status post coil embolization at ___ ___ years ago who 
presented with subacute course of L eye pain and diplopia. He 
did not experience any issues since the initial repair until 3 
months ago when he started to notice vision changes involving 
his left eye. He reported transient loss of vision in his left 
eye complaining of blurriness which improved after approximately 
1 hour, usually in the morning. These incidents have been 
ongoing since he first noticed them 3 months ago, without 
significant progression of symptoms. In addition, he notes 
diplopia with left gaze as well as upward gaze, as well as 
increased redness and swelling of his left eye on certain 
occasions which improves over time. 

Given his exam findings notable for a L ___ nerve, partial third 
nerve palsy and L hemibody decrease sensation to light-touch, 
pinprick, and temperature in the setting of a prior CCF there 
was concern is that the etiology of his deficits could localize 
to the cavernous sinus, however work up for these was negative. 
Cerebral angiogram did not reveal evidence for a carotid 
cavernous fistula. However there were coils from the previous 
procedure in the cavernous sinus and distal left ICA explaining 
his left ICA occlusion on CTA. Good collaterals filling left 
ophthalmic artery and rest of the anterior
circulation. Per Neurosurgery, removing any of the coils from 
the cavernous sinus would probably put him at high risk for 
worse side effects.

MRI was negative for signs of demyelinating lesions, stroke, 
hemorrhage or mass. It showed a mucous cyst in the L maxillary 
sinus and mild mucosal thickening of the left ethmoid sinuses. 
ENT recommended that patient follow up with them on outpatient 
basis for this. of his symptoms secondary to compressive 
effects. 

To exclude any other potential etiology of cranial neuropathies, 
we obtained a lumbar puncture which was bland with 0 WBC, 1 RBC, 
28 protein, sent oligoclonal band testing which was pending at 
time of discharge. 

===================================
Transitional issues:
===================================

- Per ENT - pt will need to follow outpt basis with them for the
mucous cyst
- Per Ophthalmology - outpatient follow up will be arranged for 
this
___.
- consider steroids such as a Medrol Dosepak to see if that will 
help him

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for left eye pain and double vision 
which had been going on for past 3 months. Given you exam, we 
obtained brain imaging and a cerebral angiogram was done which 
showed that there was no recurrence of the 
carotid cavernous fistula. There were coils from the previous 
procedure in the cavernous sinus. Neurosurgery recommended that 
removing any of the coils from the cavernous sinus would 
probably put you at high risk and therefore this was not 
pursued.
Your MRI was also reassuring against signs of demyelinating 
lesions, stroke, blood or mass. It showed a mucous cyst in the 
left maxillary sinus, ENT  recommended that you see them in 
their clinic for this. To exclude any other potential etiology 
of inflammation, we obtained a lumbar puncture, preliminary 
results were negative for inflammation or infection.
 
 We did not change your medications.

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body 

 
 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
