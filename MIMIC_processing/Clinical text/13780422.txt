Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

___: CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Lack of intra-abdominal fat and oral contrast makes 
assessment slightly 
suboptimal.  However, findings are concerning for appendicitis.  
Apparently blind-ending tubular structure in the right lower 
quadrant measures 11 mm in diameter and demonstrates wall edema, 
worrisome for appendicitis.  No drainable fluid collection seen. 
 If clinical picture does not correlate, consider repeat CT of 
the lower abdomen and pelvis following oral contrast 
administration/long prep. 
2. Left ovarian corpus luteum. 
3. Small amount of pelvic free fluid.
