IMAGING/DIAGNOSTICS:
(___) Renal Ultrasound- Increased echogenicity of the renal 
parenchyma bilaterally consistent with chronic medical renal 
disease.  There is no hydronephrosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a type 2 diabetes (last 
A1C 6.3 on ___, CKD Stage 3 (baseline Cr 1.3-1.5) who 
presented with elevated Cr, consistent with acute on chronic 
renal failure. 

#Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Patient presented with acute on 
chronic renal failure, given prior 2 week history of oliguria 
and Cr. of 3.8 on ED presentation (baseline 1.3-1.5). About a 
month prior to hospitalization, she underwent a colonoscopy and 
noted 2 weeks of diarrhea and low water/food intake following 
the procedure. In the ED, renal US revealed no hydronephrosis. 
Her labs and history were consistent with prerenal kidney injury 
and subsequent ischemic ATN. Renal was consulted and agreed with 
this diagnosis. There were no signs of uremic encephalopathy or 
volume overload and electrolytes were stable. At admission, 
patient's omeprazole, losartan, and metformin were put on hold. 
Patient reported high urine output, suggesting recovery/diuresis 
phase of ATN. She was given 2 L IV fluids and encouraged to 
drink water. Her Cr levels stabilized with fluid challenge and 
did not worsen during hospitalization. 

#Hypertension: On admission to the floor, patient's blood 
pressure was elevated at 170-190/80-90. Her losartan was put on 
hold and her carvedilol was increased from daily to BID during 
her stay. Her blood pressure decreased to 130s/50s following 
these medication adjustments. Losartan was held upon discharge 
given ___.

#Anemia: As per patient, she is anemic at baseline and 
colonscopy in ___ for anemia workup revealed diverticulosis, 
with no obvious source of slow bleed or malignancy. One could 
consider having an outpatient EGD for this patient given 
longstanding GERD.

#Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: metformin was discontinued in the 
setting of ___. Her home trajenta was held in the hospital and 
she was on insulin sliding scale. Of note, her glucose was in 
the ___ while hospitalized. This may be secondary to ___, 
but patient may also tolerate less aggressive diabetic regimen.

***Transitional Issues***
- Discharge creatinine: 3.8
- Repeat creatinine in 1 week and fax results to Dr. ___ at 
___:  ___ 
- Carvedilol increased to BID for blood pressure control, 
please f/u blood pressure after discontinuation of losartan
- Losartan and metformin discontinued at discharge given renal 
function
- Patient's blood glucose was ___ while hospitalized, 
please continue to follow and adjust diabetic management as 
indicated
- Patient was having an outpatient workup for anemia, and given 
longstanding GERD, may consider an EGD as part of the workup 
(no melena, no weight loss, no dysphagia).

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care at ___! 
You were admitted to the hospital after your routine labs showed 
elevated creatinine, which means your kidneys were not working 
as well as they were before. You were seen by the kidney team, 
and it is likely this happened after having the prolonged 
episodes of diarrhea and little oral intake. Your kidney 
function will take time to improve, and will need to be followed 
closely as an outpatient. If you notice your leg swelling is 
getting worse, if you have trouble breathing, or if you have any 
confusion, please seek medical attention immediately. 

After discharge, you should follow up with your doctors at 
___ for monitoring and evaluation. 

We wish you the best! 
Sincerely, 
Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
