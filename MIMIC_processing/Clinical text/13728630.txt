Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
biliary ductal dilatation
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using 
a sphincterotome.
The sphincterotome was exchanged for a CRE balloon catheter. 
Balloon sweeps were performed and yielded scant sludge. 
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush at 
the ampulla
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 
ampulla  
 

Impression: Normal major papilla
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was 
injected resulting in complete opacification. The procedure was 
not difficult. 
 The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left 
hepatic ducts, and biliary radicles were filled with contrast 
and well visualized. There was evidence of common hepatic duct 
and CBD dilation to 1.4 cm down to the ampulla. 
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using 
a sphincterotome.
The sphincterotome was exchanged for a CRE balloon catheter. 
Balloon sweeps were performed and yielded scant sludge. 
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush at 
the ampulla
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 
ampulla  
 

Recommendations: Admit to hospital for monitoring
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated
No aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for 5 days.
Follow up with cytology reports. Please call Dr. ___ 
___ ___ in 7 days for the pathology results
 
EUS:   EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz 
frequency:  The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the 
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum.  The body and 
tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus.   


Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the uncinate, head, body 
and tail of the pancreas was hyperchoic, consistent with fatty 
infiltration.

Pancreatic duct: The pancreatic duct measured 5.1 mm in maximum 
diameter at the ampulla and head, but was of normal caliber in 
the body and tail.  The duct was normal in echotexture and 
contour.  No intra-ductal stones were noted.  No dilated 
side-branches were noted.

___ vasculature:  Portal vein, splenic vein and 
porto-splenic confluence were imaged and appeared normal.  The 
imaged superior mesenteric vein and artery were imaged and 
appeared normal.

Common bile duct: The bile duct was imaged at the level of the 
porta-hepatis, head of the pancreas and ampulla.  The CBD was 
dilated to the ampulla with a maximum diameter of 9.9 mm.  The 
bile duct was otherwise normal in appearance.   No intrinsic 
stones or sludge were noted.  

The ampulla appeared prominent sonographically.
 

Recommendations: Proceed to ERCP (see ERCP report for further 
recommendations) given dilation of both the PD and CBD and in 
the context of a prominent ampulla 
If any fever, worsening abdominal pain, or post procedure 
symptoms, please call the advanced endoscopy fellow on call 
___/ pager ___.

had sustained virologic response since that point.  He required
some dose adjustments of ribavirin due to symptomatic anemia and
nausea..

Discharge Diagnosis:
- dilation of the bile ducts with diagnostic endoscopic 
ultrasound and ERCP (endoscopic retrocholangiopancreatogram) and 
biopsies taken

 
Discharge Condition:
ambulatory
alert and oriented x 3

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to undergo an ERCP procedure to evaluate the 
cause of dilation of some of your bile ducts both inside and 
outside the liver.  You had an endoscopic procedure to visualize 
the area with an ultrasound and then ERCP that opened one of the 
sphincters in the bile ducts and to biopsy this area.  You 
tolerated the procedure well and do not need to have any 
antibiotics after the procedure. You did not have any pain today 
and you have been able to tolerate a regular diet so you are 
ready to go home.  Please call Dr. ___ ___ in 7 days for the pathology results.

You have cut down smoking and we encourage you to continue 
cutting down and trying to stop, particularly if you are going 
to be eligible for a liver transplant in the future if that is 
necessary.  Ask your PCP and the liver team for help with trying 
to quit.
