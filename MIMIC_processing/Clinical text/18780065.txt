Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary angiography with primary stenting of the 
circumflex/obtuse marginal artery for acute inferior STEMI
 
History of Present Illness:
___ man with a history of untreated borderline 
hypertension, current tobacco use, and anxiety/depression 
presenting to ED with chest pain with EKG concerning for STEMI. 
Patient reported 3 weeks of burning epigastric chest pain 
without any workup. Today, 1 hour before arrival, the pain 
became crushing, The patient felt very weak and called EMS. EKG 
showed ST elevations in the inferior and right-sided leads and 
ST depressions in the anterior leads concerning for inferior 
STEMI. Patient received full dose aspirin and nitroglycerin in

___ Coronary angiography and PCI
Coronary Anatomy 
Dominance: Right 
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent CAD. The LAD had no 
angiographically apparent CAD. The CX was totally occluded in 
the OM in a large vessel. The RCA had mild plaquing. 
Interventional Details
A 6 ___ EBU3.5 guiding catheter was used to engage the LMCA 
and provided good support. A 180 cm Prowater guidewire was then 
successfully delivered across the lesion. Predilated with a 2.0 
mm balloon and then deployed a 3.5 x 16 mm Promus stent that was 
postdilated with a 3.5 mm balloon. Final angiography revealed 
normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis.
Impressions: 1. Acute MI managed by primary PCI of the LAD with 
DES.

___ Echocardiogram
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The right atrial pressure 
could not be estimated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls (see schematic) 
and preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 44%. 
Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There 
is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No 
ventricular septal defect is seen. Normal right ventricular 
cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. There 
is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is physiologic 
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mild regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with single 
vessel coronary artery disease (RCA/LCx distribution).

___ 05:30AM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Phos-4.3 Mg-2.___ mam with a history of untreated borderline 
hypertension, current tobacco use, and anxiety/depression 
presenting to ED with chest pain found to have inferior STEMI 
with total occlusion of obtuse marginal, now s/p DES x1.

Active Issues:
# Inferior STEMI: Patient with smoking and likely family history 
as risk factors. He presented with crushing chest pain, 
weakness, diaphoresis, and nausea. Patient received full dose 
aspirin and nitroglycerin in the field with minimal relief. EKG 
showed ST elevation in the inferior and right ventricle leads 
and ST depressions in the anterior leads, concerning for 
inferior STEMI. Emergent angiography showed occlusion of the 
obtuse marginal branch treated with a drug-eluting stent with 
revascularization within 90 minutes of symptom onset. He was 
loaded with ticagralor. Peak CK-MB 112 and troponin-T 2.35 with 
early washout. There was no evidence of heart failure 
clinically. Echocardiogram demonstrated mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with LVEF 44% and hypokinesis of the 
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls most consistent 
with single vessel coronary artery disease (RCA/LCx 
distribution). Patient had short runs of non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia and was started on metoprolol. He will 
be medically managed with ASA, ticagrelor, high dose 
atorvastatin, metoprolol succinate, and lisinopril. The patient 
was informed of the importance of uninterrupted dual 
anti-platelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis and of the FDA 
warning to not take more than 81 mg of ASA daily while on 
ticagrelor. He was also advised not to take NSAIDs for pain due 
to drug-drug interactions with ACE-inhibitor and ASA. Benefits 
of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation reviewed with the patient. 
The patient was provided with referral information and a 
prescription for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The 
importance of smoking cessation was also reiterated with the 
patient.

# Orthostatic hypotension: On ___, patient had orthostatic 
hypotension to systolic ___ with standing. Patient was 
encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and repeat orthostatic 
vital signs were negative. Metoprolol succinate dosing was 
adjusted to 25 mg daily for this reason (instead of 50 mg 
daily).

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
# Depression/anxiety: Continued sertraline 100 mg BID, Ramelteon 
for sleep 

# Tobacco use: 1ppd for ___ yrs. Discharged with resources for 
smoking cessation, including nicotine patch.

# Binge drinking of alcohol: Patient reported ~16 beers over 
most weekends. He denied withdrawal symptoms or H/O complicated 
withdrawal. He was counseled on recommendations for safe alcohol 
consumption.

Transitional Issues: 
[] Continue to discuss and encourage smoking cessation.
[] Continue to titrate metoprolol and lisinopril.

NEW medications:
-Atorvastatin 80 mg PO/NG QPM 
-Aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY 
-Lisinopril 5 mg PO/NG DAILY 
-Metoprolol succinate 25 mg DAILY
-TiCAGRELOR 90 mg PO/NG BID
