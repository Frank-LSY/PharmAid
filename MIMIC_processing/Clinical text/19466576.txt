CT head without contrast:

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities 
which are likely
sequela of chronic small vessel disease.  If high clinical 
concern for acute
stroke, MRI would be more sensitive.
3. Polypoid density in the sphenoid sinus with some internal 
high density
components.  While could be just due to underlying sinus disease 
and retention
cyst, a solid lesion is not excluded based on this study.  
Correlation with
prior imaging may prove useful.

CTA head and neck:
CTA head:
No evidence of large vessel occlusion or intracranial aneurysm. 
The dural
venous sinuses are patent without evidence of thrombosis. 
Mild-to-moderate
atherosclerotic calcifications of the intracranial internal 
carotid arteries,
left greater than right.
 
CTA neck:
There is extensive calcification of the aortic arch. There is 
high-grade
stenosis of the right external carotid artery, series 6, image 
192). There is
mild stenosis of the left external carotid artery. Moderate 
atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted of the bilateral carotid origins. No 
evidence of
high-grade stenosis or dissection of the internal carotid or 
vertebral
arteries. Left dominant vertebrobasilar system.
 
Bibasilar atelectasis with biapical scarring. Pulmonary blebs 
are scattered
through the lung parenchyma.

MRI head without contrast:

IMPRESSION:
1. Small acute left pontine infarct.
2. No no evidence of mass, hemorrhage or other infarction.
3. Mild periventricular and subcortical white matter signal 
changes,
nonspecific and likely sequelae of chronic microangiopathy.
4. Small amount of bilateral mastoid fluid.
5. Paranasal sinus disease.

TTE:
IMPRESSION: Poor image quality. No obvious intracardiac shunt. 
Posterior and lateral wall hypokinesis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with recent TIA (___), pAF (on 
apixaban), PMR (on chronic prednisone), CKD (baseline 1.2), 
hypertension, GERD and hearing loss who is admitted to the 
Neurology stroke service with a right facial weakness and 
garbled speech secondary to an acute ischemic stroke in the left 
paramedian pons. Her stroke was most likely secondary to small 
vessel event given involvement of deep penetrating artery off 
the basilar. We did not consider this a failure of Apixiban. She 
continued her Apixiban at 2.5 mg. Her deficits are mild with 
flattened nasolabial fold and mild dysarthria. She will be 
discharge to home with ___ follow up. The patient was noted to 
have signs/symptoms silent aspiration on evaluation by speech 
pathology. It is unclear how much of this is chronic and how 
much is related to the new stroke. However, we discussed with 
patients family about risk of silent aspiration, and they would 
like to defer any procedures such as PEG tube given patients 
age. She will continue to eat as she pleases with the 
understanding that there is a risk for ongoing aspiration.

Statin medication was not started for hyperlipidemia due to low 
likelihood that she would gain a significant 
cardiovascular/survival benefit from it. 

Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) Mild/moderate intracranial atherosclerosis - mild/moderate 
atherosclerotic calcifications of the cavernous internal carotid 
arteries
2) Hyperlipidemia: LDL 147. Did not start statins given 
diminishing benefits at this age. 
3) Atrial fibrillation: rate control on metoprolol. Continued AC 
with Apixaban 2.5 mg. 
4) Hypertension: continued metoprolol.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right facial weakness 
and slurry speech resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
Hypertension, Atrial fibrillation, previous history of 
mini-stroke

We are not changing your medications. Please take your other 
medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
