History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of recent
gastric sleeve performed in ___ 4 months ago who presents with
acute worsening of chronic abdominal pain. 

The pain is in her right upper quadrant and has been ongoing for
several hours. Patient has had 4 episodes of acute onset RUQ 
pain
over the past 1 mo, the first three episodes lasted ___. All
occurred in association with eating fatty foods and patient
describes associated nausea and non-bilious emesis with
occasional specks of red blood. The most recent episode occurred
after eating a ___, 4:30PM->12AM on ___. Currently without
any abd pain, mild nausea. She denies fevers and chills,
diarrhea. She endorsed dark urine that started yesterday. Of
note, patient has been taking APAP and ibuprofen ___ weekly for
HAs, but last took them a few weeks ago. Also takes a daily MV,
stopped taking prenatal vitamin/esomeprazole/simethicone about
2mo ago. No EtOH or other supplements. 

She initially presented to ___ where labs were notable for
normal CBC, normal BMP, transaminitis AST/ALT 705/561, ALP 192,
Tbili 1.1, albumin 4.4. Her UA was with increased SG and 40
ketones, moderate bili. Her RUQUS showed:

IMPRESSION:
1. Solid distended gallbladder with ___uct which is
enlarged in the ___. However I do not see any stones in
the gallbladder nor distal common duct stone. One cannot be
excluded. Consideration for MRI\MRCP. The gallbladder wall is 2
mm in thickness upper limits of normal. No pericholecystic 
fluid.
2. Echogenic mass within the liver has the appearance of a
hemangioma.

She was transferred to ___ for further evaluation/management.  


- In the ED, initial vitals were:
97.8 66 114/65 18 99% RA 

- Exam was notable for:
Con: no scleral icterus
Abd: Soft, Nontender, Nondistended. No masses or overlying skin
changes. No organomegaly. Well-healed surgical scars.
Skin: No rash, Warm and dry

- Labs were notable for:

Na 144, K 4.2, Cl 109, HCO3 of 23, BUN 9, Cr 0.7

WBC, 1 epi  

Serum tox negative 
Urine tox negative
Hcg negative 

- Studies were notable for:
CT Abdomen and Pelvis with and without contrast with

reactive.
2. Hypodense hepatic lesion remains incompletely characterized,
but in
combination with finding seen on recent ultrasound likely
represents a
hemangioma. Hypodensity near the falciform ligament likely
represents focal fat.
3. Mild splenomegaly.

pain, nausea, or vomiting. She states that her urine has gotten
darker started ___ days ago. The patient denies yellowing of her
skin, but her sister states that she thinks the patient looks
more yellow than usual. Patient denies lightheadedness,
dizziness, orthostatic symptoms. She endorses occasional

IMAGING:
========

___: CTAP
1. No biliary dilatation.  Gallbladder-wall edema is presumably 
reactive in the setting of underlying transaminitis.
2. Hypodense hepatic lesion remains incompletely characterized, 
but in
combination with finding seen on recent ultrasound likely 
represents a
hemangioma.  Hypodensity near the falciform ligament likely 
represents focal fat.
3. Mild splenomegaly.
4. No other acute findings within the abdomen/pelvis.

___: HIDA
Normal hepatobiliary study. Gallbladder ejection fraction 
normal.

___: MRCP
 
1. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  
No imaging 
findings to explain LFT abnormalities. 
2. Signal abnormality at the junction of segment ___ and segment 
IVb 
corresponds to the prior finding on CT most likely represents 
focal fatty 
deposition, less likely a steatotic adenoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of recent 
gastric sleeve performed in ___ 4 months ago who presents with 
acute worsening of chronic abdominal pain which is consistent 
with biliary colic. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#Acute hepatitis 
#Biliary Colic
The patient described right upper quadrant pain that radiated 
into the back shoulder in the setting of eating fatty meal which 
is most likely consistent with biliary colic. However the 
patient had a CT abdomen pelvis which did not show biliary duct 
dilation or cholelithiasis. There was associated gallbladder 
edema which is likely reactive to the patient's hepatitis. Given 
the suggestive features of biliary colic the patient had a HIDA 
scan which did not show gallbladder abnormalities.

#ACUTE HEPATITIS
The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain and was 
found to have LFT abnormalities consistent with hepatocellular 
injury. There is no indication of medication induced hepatitis, 
shock liver, toxin induced hepatitis. Viral hepatitis studies 
were negative. Autoimmune hepatitis panels were negative. The 
patient had an MRCP which showed no intra/extrahepatic biliary 
ductal dilatation. Shows a steatotic adenoma on the segment ___ 
and segment IVb, but no cause of the AST.ALT elevations. This is 
possible due to passed gallstone. 

#Hemangioma:
CT abdomen revealed hypodense hepatic lesion that remains 
incompletely characterized, but in combination with finding seen 
on recent ultrasound likely represents a benign hemangioma. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
DISCHARGE AST/ALT: 114/379

[] would repeat LFTs to ensure downtrending 
[] consider hepatology consult if LFTs do not normalize. 
[] would ensure no vitamin deficiencies in the setting of 
gastric sleeve
[] Has focal steatosis near the falciform ligament and a 
hemangioma seen on ultrasound. 
[] Note that hepatitis serologies were consistent with 
non-immune hepatitis B status.
