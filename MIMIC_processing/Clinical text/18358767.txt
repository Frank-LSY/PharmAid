Pertinent Results:
ERCP ___

Impression: The scout film was normal. Cannulation of the 
biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using 
a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected resulting in 
complete opacification. The procedure was not difficult.  
During biliary cannulation, the pancreatic duct was partially 
filled with contrast and visualized proximally.  The bile duct 
was successfully cannulated using a Rx sphincterotome preloaded 
with a 0.035in guidewire. Contrast was injected and there was 
brisk flow through the ducts. Contrast extended to the entire 
biliary tree.  
Contrast injection revealed a filling defect in the lower third 
CBD consistent with a stone. A biliary sphincterotomy was 
successfully performed with the sphincterotome. There was no 
post-sphincterotomy bleeding.  
The sphincterotome was exchanged for a balloon. The biliary 
tree was swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting at the 
bifurcation. One stone and sludge were successfully removed. The 
CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones were 
seen.  
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. Excellent bile and contrast drainage was 
seen endoscopically and fluoroscopically. I supervised the 
acquisition and interpretation of the fluoroscopic images. The 
quality of the fluoroscopic images was good.
