Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with uncontrolled HTN presenting with x2 epistaxis 
within last 8hr. ENT did not consult, but verbally indicated 
that they felt the epistaxis was likely related to the patient's 
hypertension and the dry air in the airplanes in which ___ works 
___ is a ___).  They recommended blood pressure 
control, lateral nasal pressure, and oxymetolazine spray.  These 
measures worked very well and the patient's bleeding quickly 
stopped.

On the day of discharge the patient was feeling well and looking 
forward to going home.  ___ had had no more episodes of bleeding 
from though to that have brought him into the hospital.  We 
discussed his hypertension management and medications, his 
diabetes management and medications, the importance of 
follow-up, including regarding his CPAP therapy, and his 
polycythemia requiring further workup in the outpatient setting. 
 ___ understood and had no additional questions for me.

#Epistaxis
Two episodes of epistaxis from the right nostril.  Given ___ 
time occurrence, no other bleeding issues, no history of 
coagulopathy in his family, normal labs (apart from 
polycythemia), negative tox screen, no insertion of foreign 
objects into nose, it's felt that most likely his bleed was 
caused by dry air on plane and hypertension. 

#Polycythemia
-likely requires further workup, though I do wonder if this 
could be related to his sleep apnea
-Unfortunately due to restrictions on inpatient lab ordering, 
the indicated testing 
 -- erythropoietin level and JAK2 V617F Mutation Detection -- 
could not be ordered
These are transitional issues for outpatient primary care

#Hypertension
#Possible CAD (given septal Q waves on old ECG)
-Blood pressure continues to be above goal at his PCP 
___.  PCP was hoping to increase his lisinopril, 
especially given his ongoing albuminuria with diabetes.  "If 
potassium remains high, may need to start a thiazide in addition 
to increase lisinopril. Regardless, patient will return to 
clinic for blood pressure titration and lab follow-up in 2 
weeks."
-Patient was continued on his home medications including 
acetazolamide (prescribed by his sleep physician), amlodipine 
and lisinopril
-Consider further evaluation for coronary disease given the 
septal Q waves seen on ___ ECG
-___ will follow-up with his PCP

___ 2 diabetes mellitus
-A1c here was 7.0
-was on metformin 500 mg daily at home, increased to 500 mg 
twice daily on discharge to try to get patient's HbA1c <7%

#Obstructive sleep apnea
-Continues to suffer from suboptimal CPAP adherence due to 
discomfort  
-Encouraged outpatient follow-up with Sleep/Pulmonary to improve 
adherence

#Obesity
-Encouraged patient to keep considering gastric sleeve with the 
weight loss surgery clinic

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after suffering several nose bleeds.  These 
were felt to be due to your hypertension (high blood pressure) 
and the drain air on the planes where you work as a member of 
the in-flight crew.  After controlling your blood pressure and 
giving you some sprays of oxymetazoline nasal spray, your 
bleeding stopped.

We also found that you have a high hemoglobin level.  It's not 
yet clear why you have this.  More testing should be performed 
by your primary care doctor.

It's important to follow-up as noted below and to take your 
medications as prescribed.
