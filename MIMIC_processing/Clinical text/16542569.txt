ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. 

On POD2, Foley catheter was removed without difficulty and diet

was relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in 
stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding 
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On 
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of
