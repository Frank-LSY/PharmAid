History of Present Illness:
___ w/ lichen planus (oral and genital involvement; on MTX),

with esophagitis, longstanding DOE (not well explained on a 
basic
workup), who presents with RLL PNA failing to improve on PO
Levaquin.

She was first seen ___ at an urgent care where she reported
fatigue, chills/subjective fevers, and cough. She was diagnosed
with a RLL PNA and was treated with Levaquin 750 mg PO for five
days. She felt like she improved mildly with this initial
treatment, but progress plateaued and she has continued to have
productive cough and fatigue. Her Levaquin was extended to a
ten-day course by her PCP. 

By ___ (seven days into her total Levaquin course) she felt
distinctly worse. She was wheezing and the productive cough had
become continuous to a point where it interfered with sleep.
There is a "rattle " of wet secretions in her lungs that doesn't
go away no matter how much she coughs. She was felt to be
clinically worsening on CAP treatment and was sent to the ED.

Vitals in the ED were: 96.2F, 91, 177/78, 17, 88% on RA ->98% on
NC. Labs were fairly unremarkable. CXR showed persistence of her
known lung infiltrate (as would be expected regardless of
presence/absence of clinical improvement). ED physician noted
diffuse wheezing and rhonchi throughout the right lung. She was
given CTX/azithro as alternate community-acquired pneumonia
treatment, multiple duonebs, and was admitted to medicine.

Imaging:
Chest CT ___: 
FINDINGS:  
  
NECK, THORACIC INLET, AXILLAE, CHEST WALL: The imaged neck base 
is 
unremarkable.  Supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes are not 
enlarged. 
  
UPPER ABDOMEN: A 1.8 cm fluid attenuation structure in segment 
III adjacent to 
the falciform ligament is most likely a simple cyst (03:55).  
Colonic 
diverticulosis is partially imaged.  The imaged upper abdomen is 
otherwise 
unremarkable. 
  
MEDIASTINUM: An enlarged right low paratracheal node measures 
1.1 cm, and has 
a fatty hilum. 
  
HILA: Discrete right hilar lymph nodes are difficult to see 
given the absence 
of IV contrast, but there is fullness of the right hilus 
suggestive of 
lymphadenopathy.  There is no left hilar lymphadenopathy. 
  
HEART and PERICARDIUM: Heart size is normal.  Coronary artery 
calcifications 
are mild along the left anterior descending artery.  Pericardium 
is 
physiologic.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. 
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
LUNG: 
  
There are extensive ___ opacities throughout the right 
lower lobe.  
There are additional areas of consolidation at the right base.  
There is 
atelectasis versus scarring at the right lung apex.  There is 
associated 
bronchial wall thickening.  This finding appears isolated to the 
right lower 
lobe.  Airways are patent to the subsegmental level. 
  
CHEST CAGE: No acute fracture or suspicious osseous lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
___ and consolidative opacities in the right lower lobe 
with 
associated bronchial wall thickening and reactive 
hilar/mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy most consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia. 

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ lichen planus (oral and genital involvement; on MTX), 
GERD with esophagitis, longstanding DOE (not well explained on a 
basic workup), who presents with RLL PNA that failed to improve 
on PO Levaquin, admitted for further workup.

#RLL PNEUMONIA
#ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXIA: Given CT wet read 
findings just concerning for pneumonia changes and no evidence 
of complicating factors or fibrosis, this is likely just CAP 
with a typical pathogen that happens to be resistant to 
Levaquin. She is already improving on CTX/azithro, so we will 
discharge her on Cefpodoxime/azithromycin to be completed on 
___ for a ___n induced and expectorated sputum 
sample were insufficient so no true sample was able to be 
obtained. A CT chest was done which showed pneumonia and no 
other concerning findings like fibrosis or other concerning 
parenchymal changes. We were initially concerned for 
Methotrexate-related fibrosis (not seen) or other more rare 
infections that methotrexate can predispose to, but given rapid 
clinical improvement on CAP treatment this seemed less likely. 
She will follow up with her PCP ___ ___ for further management. 
In the meantime, we agreed that she will hold her methotrexate 
and follow up with her PCP and ophthalmologist/rheumatologist 
for further management of this. She initially required oxygen 
but on day of discharge her oxygen saturation was low ___ on 
room air including with exertion.

#GERD: continue home PPI

#Sinus headache: prescribed fluticasone nasal spray and can use 
Tylenol for the headache.

#LICHEN PLANUS holding MTX as above. She is supposed to be on 
cyclosporine as well but never filled the prescription. We 
recommended that she meet with her ophthalmologist and PCP for 
further management of this issue. Continue folate

#HTN continue losartan

Transitional Issues:
[] Holding methotrexate as above. F/u with PCP and 
ophthalmologist/rheumatologist for further management.
