History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with no known past medical
history (does not go to doctor) who presents today with sudden
onset headache and left visual field cut.

She states that while at work on the computer two days ago, she
developed sudden onset of a pounding headache on the right side,
behind her eye. At the same time, she noticed something was 
wrong
with her vision on the left, although she couldn't completely
characterize it. She says it was "out of focus." This persisted
all day. The next day, the headache was slightly improved but 
she
was nauseated. She went to bed and then this morning her 
headache
and nausea were gone. However, the vision on the left side was
still not clear and so she presented to urgent care.

At urgent care, a ___ was done showing a right occipital
hypodensity and so she was transferred to ___.

During this time, she denies any trouble with language, any
facial droop or focal weakness/numbness.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies diplopia,
dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or
hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

NCHCT: 1. Area of hypodensity in the right occipital region may 
reflect vasogenic edema due to a possible underlying mass or 
subacute infarct.  Further evaluation with MRI is recommended. 
2. No intracranial hemorrhage. 

CTA head/neck: 1. Persistent moderate hypodensity in the right 
occipital lobe with mild local 
mass effect, most likely a recent infarction.  A mass is less 
likely. 
2. CTA of the head and neck demonstrates no evidence for 
flow-limiting 
stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm. 

MRI head: Moderate-sized early subacute infarction in the right 
occipital lobe in the right posterior cerebral artery territory, 
involving the right occipital pole. 
There is mild associated hyperemia and possible mild faint 
contrast 
enhancement, the latter likely secondary to breakdown of the 
blood-brain 
barrier. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ was admitted for symptoms of sudden onset 
headache and left visual field cut. Exam initially showed a left 
visual field cut but has improved during the course of her 
hospitalization, now back to normal with no metamorphopsia. She 
was found to have a right PCA stroke affecting her right 
occipital lobe. Stroke risk factors include hypertension. Her 
A1c is 5.8%, LDL 86. CTA head/neck did not show dissection or 
vessel cut off. TEE negative for clot/PFO. She was placed on a 
30 day holter monitor to look for atrial fibrillation, in which 
case she will need systemic anticoagulation. She has not seen a 
PCP in years and will need to follow up with one for general 
health maintenance. She was started on lisinopril 20mg daily and 
will need outpatient titration for goal of normotension. She 
will also need to be evaluated by ophthalmology for visual field 
testing.

Transitional issues
1. Health maintenance with PCP
2. Titrate BP to <140/80
3. Ophthalmology follow-up for visual field testing

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of vision changes 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms. 
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- high blood pressure
  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- start aspirin 81mg daily
- start lisinopril 20mg daily
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below. 
 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

It was a pleasure taking care of you, and we wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
