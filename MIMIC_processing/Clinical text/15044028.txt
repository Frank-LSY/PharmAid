IMAGING: 
EGD ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Transitional Issues:
[ ] Check CBC at next primary care appointment 
[ ] Iron held on discharge to prevent confusion with detecting 
further GI bleeds- restart at discretion of PCP
[ ] Omeprazole stopped and pantoprazole 40mg BID started for 
short term prevention of GI bleed- stop pantoprazole and start 
omeprazole at discretion of PCP 
[ ] CT Abd/Pelvis showed right hepatic lobe arterial 
enhancement, ___, either related to a transient hepatic 
perfusion difference, small hemangioma or even postprocedural 
shunt.  If clinically warranted, nonurgent MR can better assess 
this finding.

Brief Hospital Course:

Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male history of HCV cirrhosis s/p
Harvoni (no prior history of decompensation), thrombocytopenia,
history of colonic polyps, HTN, referred from PCP due to 
asymptomatic anemia. 

ACUTE ISSUES:  
=============  
# Blood loss anemia
On review of outpatient records, the patient
had a normal Hb ___ and when he presented for labs prior to
annual exam this ___ he had a Hb of 6.0. He was guaiac
positive at this point with brown stool and started on 
omeprazole
with concern for slow GI bleeding. He had an EGD that showed
gastritis and was started on iron supplementation. One month
later at ___ his Hb was 5.5 and he was referred to ED. He
is now s/p 3u of pRBC. His Hb responded appropriately (after 2nd
unit it did not respond much so he was given 3rd unit and
responded well). Iron studies are consistent with iron
deficiency anemia and absolute retic count of 0.09 shows
inadequate response to anemia, possibly in the setting of known
cirrhosis. GAVE (gastric antral vascular extasia) found on EGD 
on ___, which can cause slow GI bleed and anemia over time. 
This may be the cause of his anemia. Triphasic CT on this 
admission without signs of varices. Colonoscopy without signs of 
active bleeding- showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, 
internal hemorrhoids, and dilated veins in the proximal and 
distal rectum with patchy erythema in the rectum (of unclear 
clinical significance). His iron was held in order to make it 
easier to detect GI bleeds given that he has had dark stools 
since starting iron. He was started on pantoprazole 40mg BID on 
discharge, and omeprazole was held. Hgb on discharge was stable 
at 8.0 on ___.

 
# Hepatitis C s/p Harvoni, complicated by cirrhosis but no
history of decompensation. LFTs normal on admission. Of note in
the past he has had an elevated AFP, 17.2 in ___, and 
down to
5.0 ___. Most recent imaging (___) showed no hepatic 
lesions concerning for malignancy. 
- Follow up Hep C VL: pending on discharge  

#Coagulopathy, INR 1.4 on admission. Likely secondary to
underlying cirrhosis. INR 1.5 on ___ on discharge. 

# Thromboyctopenia, baseline platelets ___. Did receive 1u
platelets in ED due to concern for consumptive thrombocytopenia
in the setting of bleeding however his platelets are currently 
at
baseline. Continue to monitor : Plt 42 on ___. 

 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
1. Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY

care provider

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure to care for ___ at the ___ 
___.  

Why did ___ come to the hospital?  
- ___ came to the hospital because your blood levels were very 
low. This condition is called anemia. ___ did not have any 
symptoms of your low blood levels, but ___ required admission to 
the hospital for blood transfusions and further work up to try 
to determine the cause of this anemia. 

What did ___ receive in the hospital?  
-  ___ received 3 units of blood, and your blood levels 
increased appropriately. We believe that your low blood levels 
were caused by a slow bleed in your GI tract. We did a scope of 
your stomach that showed dilated blood vessels and easily 
damaged stomach tissue. We used thermal therapy to help treat 
this. This condition can cause slow bleeding that might explain 
your anemia. We also did a CT scan that did not show other 
sources of bleeding. We also did a colonoscopy that did not show 
any signs of active bleeding.

What should ___ do once ___ leave the hospital?  
- ___ should stop taking omeprazole and iron until ___ see your 
primary care physician 
- ___ should start taking pantoprazole 40mg oral twice daily
- ___ should follow up with your primary care physician within 
the next week. Our coordinators will help to schedule an 
appointment.
- ___ should follow up with Dr. ___ in the ___ clinic 
within a few months.

We wish ___ the best!  
Your ___ Care Team
