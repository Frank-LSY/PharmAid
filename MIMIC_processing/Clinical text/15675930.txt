Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Urology after undergoing 
laparoscopic left partial nephrectomy. No concerning 
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative 
note for details. The patient received perioperative antibiotic 
prophylaxis. The patient was transferred to the floor from the 
PACU in stable condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on 
PCA, hydrated for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with 
pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and 
ambulated once.  On POD1, the patient was restarted on home 
medications, basic metabolic panel and complete blood count were 
checked, pain control was transitioned from PCA to oral 
analgesics, diet was advanced to a clears/toast and crackers 
diet. Urethral Foley catheter was removed without difficulty and 
diet was advanced as tolerated later in the evening (at home). 
The hospital course was relatively unremarkable. The patient was 
discharged in stable condition, eating well, ambulating 
independently, voiding without difficulty, and with pain control 
on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, dry, and 
intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection or infection. 
The patient was given explicit instructions to follow-up in 
clinic in four weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
-Resume your pre-admission/home medications except as noted. 
ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication changes 
and your post-operative course with your primary care doctor.

-___ reduce the strain/pressure on your abdomen and incision 
sites; remember to log roll onto your side and then use your 
hands to push yourself upright while taking advantage of the 
momentum of putting your legs/feet to the ground.

--There may be bandage strips called steristrips which have 
been applied to reinforce wound closure.  Allow these bandage 
strips to fall off on their own over time but PLEASE REMOVE ANY 
REMAINING GAUZE DRESSINGS WITHIN 2 DAYS OF DISCHARGE. You may 
get the steristrips wet.

-UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED; AVOID aspirin or aspirin containing 
products and supplements that may have blood-thinning effects 
(like Fish Oil, Vitamin E, etc.).  This will be noted in your 
medication reconciliation. 

IF PRESCRIBED (see the MEDICATION RECONCILIATION):
-IBUPROFEN (the ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be taken 
even though you may also be taking Tylenol/Acetaminophen. You 
may alternate these medications for pain control.  

For pain control, try TYLENOL (acetaminophen) FIRST, then 
ibuprofen, and then take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)

-Call your Urologist's office to schedule/confirm your follow-up 
appointment in 4 weeks AND if you have any questions.

-Do not eat constipating foods for ___ weeks, drink plenty of 
fluids to keep hydrated

-No vigorous physical activity or sports for 4 weeks or until 
otherwise advised. Light household chores/activity and leisurely 
walking/activity is OK and should be continued. Do NOT be a 
couch potato

-Tylenol should be your first-line pain medication. A narcotic 
pain medication has been prescribed for breakthrough pain ___.

-Max daily Tylenol (acetaminophen) dose is THREE to FOUR grams 
from ALL sources

AVOID lifting/pushing/pulling items heavier than 10 pounds (or

Urologist

bathe

-Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do not

-You may be given prescriptions for a stool softener and/or a 
gentle laxative. These are  over-the-counter medications that 
may be health care spending account reimbursable. 

-Colace (docusate sodium) may have been prescribed to avoid 
post-surgical constipation or constipation related to use of 
narcotic pain medications. Discontinue if loose stool or 
diarrhea develops. Colace is a stool-softener, NOT a laxative.

-Senokot (or any gentle laxative) may have been prescribed to 
further minimize your risk of constipation. 

-If you have fevers > 101.5 F, vomiting, or increased redness, 
swelling, or discharge from your incision, call your doctor or
