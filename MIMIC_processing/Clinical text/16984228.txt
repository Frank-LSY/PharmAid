point her vomiting resolved though with continued nausea. On
___ she had begun to experience palpitation lasting seconds

present

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT FOR ADMISSION:
================================
___ with history of chronic constipation who presented with 
palpitations, found to be hypokalemic likely from excessive 
laxative use. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[] Ferritin noted to be low with normal hemoglobin. This likely 
represents iron deficiency. Patient is a good candidate for IV 
iron repletion in the setting of constipation and inability to 
tolerate PO iron.
[] Please continue to manage chronic constipation.
[] If persistent hypokalemia, consider additional workup. 

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED:
=========================
# Acute on chronic hypokalemia:
The patient has a history of known hypokalemia which is thought 
to be secondary to laxative use. She also uses furosemide as 
needed for lower extremity edema of unknown etiology. On testing 
here, urine studies were consistent with GI losses of potassium 
as opposed to renal losses. We feel strongly that this was 
secondary to laxative use--the patient is on prescribed 
laxatives and was also taking between 7 and 9 bisacodyl in the 
week prior to admission. She was given IV and PO repletion, and 
her whole blood potassium were trended. On hospital day 1, her 
whole blood potassium was 3.5, and without repletion this 
remained stable at 3.7 in the afternoon. She will be discharged 
on her home regimen of potassium 40 mEq daily. We provided 
extensive counseling that her diuretic use is too excessive, 
especially in the setting of also using furosemide. I emphasized 
that hypokalemia can be life-threatening, and she needs to limit 
her laxative use. She will have repeat labs within 2 days which 
will be faxed to her gastroenterologist.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?
-You had a very low potassium.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE HERE?
-We gave you intravenous and oral potassium.
-We monitored your potassium to make sure that it was stable.
-We did an abdominal x-ray which did not show obstruction or 
large amounts of stool.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU GO HOME?
-Continue to take all of your medications as prescribed.  I 
highly recommend that you limit your laxative use because it can 
cause life-threatening electrolyte imbalances, most notably the 
low potassium.  You should aim to have one soft bowel movement 
per day and only take a laxative if you have not achieved this.  
Start with 1 bisacodyl.  If you are very constipated and are 
taking more laxatives, please call your GI doctor to make sure 
that you are doing so in a safe manner.  Also, if you take the 
furosemide, you should not be taking a laxative at the same 
time.
-Please have your labs drawn early next week.
-On ___, please call Dr. ___ schedule an appointment 
for late next week.
-You should continue to take potassium daily.  You should take 2 
packets of 20 mEq of potassium for a total of 40 mEq/day.  Do 
not take more than this.
-If you feel any further palpitations, you should call ___ 
immediately.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Medicine Team
