EUS
Impression:
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz 
frequency.
The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the duodenal 
bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body and tail 
[partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus. The 
bile duct was imaged at the level of the porta-hepatis, head of 
the pancreas and ampulla.
Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma of the pancreas was 
homogenous, with a normal salt and pepper appearance.
Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct was normal in echotexture and 
contour and caliber.
Bile duct: The bile duct was not dilated. A single intrinsic 
stone was noted.
Ampulla: The ampulla appeared normal endoscopically and 
sonographically. 
Recommendations:
If any fever, worsening abdominal pain, or post procedure 
symptoms, please call the advanced endoscopy fellow on call 
___/ pager ___.
Advanced to ERCP

ERCP
Impression:
Limited exam of the esophagus was normal.
Limited exam of the stomach showed a nodulaire lesion with 
central depression in the antrum, most consistent with a 
pancreatic rest.
Limited exam of the duodenum was normal.
The scout film was normal. The major papilla was normal.
The major papilla was successfully cannulated using a Rx 
sphincterotome preloaded with 0.035in guidewire.
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. Contrast 
injection revealed a filling defect in the lower CBD consistent 
with a stone.
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. There 
was mild post-sphincterotomy oozing which was self-limited. The 
sphincetrotomy was completed with a sphincteroplasty. A balloon 
sphincteroplasty was successfully performed using a 8-10mm CRE 
balloon up to 10mm.
The biliary tree was swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting at the 
bifurcation. One stone and sludge were removed.
The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones 
were seen.
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD.
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically. 
Recommendations:
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain, 
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call Advanced 
Endoscopy Fellow on call ___
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated
No aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for 5 days.
Discussed with primary team.
EGD +/- EUS to assess the nodular lesion in the antrum in ___ 
months.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female past medical history of obesity, 
remote cholecystectomy referred admitted ___ with 
abdominal pain, nausea, abnormal LFTs, status post ERCP showing 
choledocholithiasis with obstruction, status post 
sphincterotomy and balloon extraction of stone and sludge, 
subsequently improving, able to be discharged home

# Choledocholithiasis with obstruction
# Transaminitis 
Patient presented with abdominal pain, with moderately elevated 
LFTs.  Patient underwent EUS concerning for a stone in the CBD 
with concern for obstruction, so an ERCP was performed with 
biliary sphincterotomy, sphincteroplasty, and balloon extraction 
of single stone and sludge.  Patient was subsequently clinically 
stable overnight without signs of bleeding or infection.  
Patient able to advance diet to regular without issue.  Patient 
discharged home with instructions to avoid NSAIDs, aspirin for 5 
days.  

# Abnormal endoscopic finding of gastric antrum
ERCP showed "Limited exam of the stomach showed a nodular lesion 
with central depression in the antrum, most consistent with a 
pancreatic rest." Per advanced endoscopy, will need EGD +/- EUS 
to assess the nodular lesion in the antrum in ___ months. 

# Hyperlipidemia
Given abnormal LFTs above, instructed patient to hold statin 
until PCP ___

# GERD
Continued omeprazole

# Abnormal CT kidney
# Abnormal CT L2 vertebrae
# Abnormal CT ileum
Outpatient CT ordered by PCP incidentally showed "Right renal 
midpole cortical low attenuating lesion, correlates with prior 
report with imaging characteristics suggestive of an 
angiomyolipoma"; also showed "Mild submucosal fat deposition 
terminal ileum, nonspecific may be related to chronic 
inflammation"; also showed "Superior endplate wedge compression 
deformity L2 vertebral body, age indeterminate." Started calcium 
and vitamin D prior to discharge.  Would consider discussion of 
these findings and any additional management at ___. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- ALT 398, AST 71, AP 222, Tbili 0.8 at discharge; would 
consider repeat at ___ to ensure normalization
- Incidental ERCP and CT findings above, with recommended 
___ as above 

> 30 minutes spent on this discharge.
