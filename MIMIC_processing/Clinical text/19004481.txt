History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed male with a history of
focal epilepsy (probable temporal) who recently established care
with Dr. ___ in ___ who presents with increased seizure
frequency. 

History obtained from patient and medical record. He first saw
Dr. ___ in ___ with complaints of amnesia. At that time
he reported discrete ___ minute episodes of confusion (not
remember what day it was, repeating himself) which would resolve
and he would go back to feeling completely normal. He never had

2
times per month. Provocation was stress and decreased sleep.
Please see Dr. ___ note from ___ regarding
the details.   

Dr. ___ his history was consistent with epilepsy (focal,
probably temporal) and he was started on Keppra 500 mg BID at
that time (___). He also had a 48 hour ambulatory EGG which
showed "bitemporal independent and  occasional bitemporal
synchronous slowing along with relatively infrequent 
bursts of more generalized but centrally predominant theta
activity. These  findings are relatively nonspecific and may
represent underlying multifocal  subcortical pathological
abnormalities, vascular disease or sequela of 
traumatic head injury. No seizure activity was acquired during
the recording sessions. No interictal epileptic activity was
noted."

Since he saw Dr. ___ in ___, he reports full compliance with
his Keppra. He has not been sick recently and has had no 
interval
head trauma. He has trouble remembering the details of what
brought him to the hospital today but thinks it was because of
"brain farts" which are his seizures. Unfortunately his family
cannot be reached as he cannot remember their numbers (but he
says he would not usually remember them). Mr. ___ thinks he
did not have any seizures up until his recent episode which
brought him to the hospital. He reports that he cannot remember
what happened but he thinks he had a seizure at church
(___). He does not remember the interval history but
reports that he feels back to his normal self. 

Review of limited ___ records indicate that his family
brought him to the hospital on ___ with concern for increased
seizure frequency. He reportedly was having staring episodes and
repeating himself for ___ days leading up to presentations. The
episodes were more frequently and lasting longer so they finally
took him to the hospital. At ___, he was having episodes of
staring into space and repeating himself. This was of unclear
duration. He was given Ativan 2 mg IV x1 and Keppra 1 g x1. WBC
7.1, Na 137, Cr 0.9, BG 110, LFTs normal, UA non-inflammatory,
Stox/Utox . unrevealing. He seemed to improve after the Ativan
and Keppra and was transferred to ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Epilepsy service on ___ in the 
setting of increased seizure frequency. He was placed on 
continuous video EEG. He was initially kept on his home Keppra 
but this was then held from ___ in an effort to capture 
seizures. Mr. ___ did not have any clinical or 
electrographic seizures and there were no epileptiform spikes on 
his EEG. In coordination with the family, his medication was 
restarted 24 hours prior to discharge. Therefore his diagnosis 
remains epilepsy that is likely temporal lobe epilepsy based on 
semiology and family history however the EEG is non-diagnostic. 
As part of his evaluation for new onset epilepsy, an LP was 
performed on ___ which had 0 WBC, 1 RBC. An autoimmune 
encephalitis panel was sent out and is pending at the time of 
discharge. HSV PCR was negative. Otherwise, Mr. ___ remained 
on his home diabetes regimen with stable blood sugar 
measurements and continues his levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.
