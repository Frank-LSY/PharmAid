History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ old man with a history of cryptogenic
stroke with residual left-sided weakness who presents with new L
ptosis, L facial numbness, and difficulty with gait.

He was last in his normal state of health last night when he 
went
to bed. When he awoke in the morning he found that he had more
difficulty than usual standing up from the bed. He was able to
ambulate to the bathroom by holding on to objects (typically he
walks short distances such as this unassisted) and was wobbly
when urinating. When washing his face, he felt that the left
lower half of his face felt odd and numb. He felt like his left
eye "had a film over it" as he had a hard time seeing out of 
that
eye. There was extra eye goop in it this morning and he thought
that this could be related. He also saw that his left eyelid was
droopy. Finally, he noticed that he had pins and needles in his
left ___ fingers and left ___ toes extending up the dorsum 
of
the foot into the lateral calf. These symptoms persisted
throughout the morning. He had to hold onto the rail when
ascending stairs and felt like his legs would buckle; he rubbed
his left eye frequently when looking at his computer to try and
get it to focus. In the afternoon he went to his scheduled ___
appointment and as his walking was not at his baseline, his
neurologist was called and recommended going to the ED for
assessment. He reluctantly agreed.

Mr. ___ has a history of a stroke in ___ for
which he received care at ___. His Atrius and ___ records
suggest that this was an embolic infarct affecting the R MCA and
ACA territories and that he was found to have a DVT and PE 
during
that hospitalization. According to Dr. ___ 
evaluation:
"The patient underwent a workup including a
hypercoagulable panel, which was negative TEE, which showed no
evidence of clot or PFO.  Telemetry showed no evidence of atrial
fibrillation or arrhythmia and vessel imaging showed no evidence
of carotid artery or intracranial atherosclerosis." He was
started on anticoagulation which he has remained on ever since.
His INR was subtherapeutic on two occasions in the last month
(1.7 and 1.8) but supratherapeutic today. He is followed by Dr.
___ at ___, from whom he receives botox
injections every three months. The last was ___.

He and his wife recall that at the time of his stroke he had:
left sided facial droop, dysarthria, dysphagia, left sided
weakness and sensory abnormalities. He had a swollen left eye on
presentation as he hit his face on a desk, so it was difficult
for his wife to tell if he truly had eyelid drooping at that
time. He does say that he had diplopia at some point during that
initial hospitalization. However, the imaging at ___ five
months later does not show any brainstem involvement, nor is
there any evidence of carotid dissection to cause a Horner's.

He has a history of syncopal episodes with a prodrome of
diaphoresis and abdominal discomfort. He has had workup at
multiple institutions (BWH, ___, ___, etc) with no other
etiology. He does not recall if he has ever had an EEG. He has
had some brief shaking episodes of his left shoulder with
preserved awareness. He is not able to suppress these. They most
often involve the shoulder but can also involve his hand and
rarely his leg. 

Neuro ROS was notable as above, as well as for tinnitus left
greater than right. Otherwise, he denies headache, loss of
vision, diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, or vertigo. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. He typically is able to
ambulater with a cane.
 
On general review of systems, he endorses a sore throat with
globus sensation and a "chesty cough." He has a chronic rash in
his face and has had tinea versicolor in the past. He denies
recent fever or chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss 
or
gain. Denies shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or 
tightness,
palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to the hospital after transient gait instability. Exam 
notable for residual left sided facial droop, dysarthria, 
spastic left sided weakness, left sided finger and foot 
parasthesias and left ptosis.

He had an MRI head w/ and w/o contrast negative for acute stroke 
or new pathology, revealing right frontal encephalomalacia is 
unchanged and consistent with a chronic infarct involving the 
right MCA and ACA distributions. CTA head was negative for large 
vessel occlusion. After further discussion with wife, all of his 
deficits were at baseline with exception of left ptosis, which 
was gradually improving.

Given that he provided history of intermittent jerking of the 
left arm with sensory changes and transient exacerbation of his 
weakness, there was concern for stroke. He was started on low 
dose Keppra, 500mg BID. He had a routine EEG that was negative 
for seizure with normal background. He did have several episodes 
of left eye>right eye twitching without electrographic 
correlate.

Overall, we believe patient most likely had a seizure, leading 
to transient worsening of his left sided symptoms that have now 
improved, including his ptosis.

He will be discharged with plans to follow up with outpatient 
Neurologist (appointment made), encouraged to continue Keppra in 
meantime. Encouraged to return to ED for any new or worsening 
symptoms.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to ___ with symptoms of left eye drooping, 
left sided sensory changes and weakness, and difficulty walking. 
To look into your symptoms, we did an MRI of your head which did 
not show any new abnormalities. We also did a CT of the vessels 
in your head (CTA) which did not show any signs of occlusions of 
blood vessels. You unsteadiness with walking improved.  After 
discussing with your family more, it is clear that your symptoms 
were at their baseline, with the exception of the left sided eye 
drooping, which is improving as well.  Because you had been 
having episodes of left sided sensory changes and movement, it 
is possible that you had a small seizure leading to temporary 
weakness. We did a routine brain wave test (EEG) which did not 
show any signs of seizure.  We placed you on an anti-seizure 
medication, Keppra, for the time being.  We will have you follow 
up with your outpatient Neurologist to determine if there are 
any further changes.  

It is important to return to the Emergency Department or contact 
your outpatient Neurologist if you have any worsening symptoms, 
difficulty swallowing, walking or other new symptoms. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
your ___ care team
