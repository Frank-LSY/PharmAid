Pertinent Results:
EEG RESULTS:
 
___ ___

History: ___ with right occipital hemorrhage and 
visual distortions. Assess for evidence of epilepsy. 

This is a 23 electrode EEG ___ placement with T1/T2) recorded 
with video, with additional EOG and EKG electrodes.

ABNORMALITY #1: The background showed an asymmetry of voltage 
between the two hemispheres posteriorly, with an attenuation of 
activity over the right posterior quadrant compared to the left. 


ABNORMALITY #2: Intermittent focal theta and delta frequency 
slowing was seen over the right hemisphere throughout the 
recording. 

BACKGROUND: Waking background over the left hemisphere was 
characterized by a 10.5 Hz maximum posterior dominant rhythm.  
Symmetric ___ mcV beta activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions. 

HYPERVENTILATION: Hyperventilation could not be performed. 

INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Stepped photic stimulation from 
___ flashes per second (fps) produced no activation of the 
record.

SLEEP: During drowsiness, the background slowed to central theta 
activity, frontal beta activity became more prominent, and the 
alpha rhythm attenuated and became intermittent. Stage 2 sleep 
was not recorded. 

CARDIAC MONITOR: A single EKG channel showed a generally regular 
rhythm with an average rate of 60-70 bpm.

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine bedside 
EEG due to (1) focal attenuation of background activity over the 
right posterior quadrant, and (2) intermittent focal slowing 
over the entire right hemisphere.  These findings are consistent 
with cortical dysfunction over the right posterior brain, and 
focal subcortical dysfunction affecting the remainder of the 
right hemisphere.   There are no epileptiform discharges or 
seizures present.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___: Mrs. ___ was transferred from ___ with 
acute right occipital hemorrhage. No acute cervical spine 
fractures were identified on CT of the c-spine.  

___: MRI of brain was ordered to rule-out structural lesion or 
explanation for the acute right occipital hemorrhage aside from 
fracture. Ophthalmology was consulted for a dilated eye exam to 
rule-out papilledema. They suggested formal visual field testing 
in their office at a later date. ___ was consulted to evaluate 
safety to return home.

___: The patient had two acute episodes of visual distortion, 
during which she described surroundings "appeared small and room 
appeared long and distorted."  A CT was obtained and found to be 
stable.  The incident was discussed with neurology, who 
recommended increasing the Keppra and oredering EEG monitoring.

___: The patient remained neurologically intact and worked 
with Physical Therapy, who recommended rehab, as the patient 
feels unsteady on her feet. Preliminary EEG results from 
overnight were read as "no seizures." Keppra dosing was set at 1 
gm BID. 

___: The patient's exam remains stable. Disposition planning 
initiated for placement into rehab for instability on feet. 

___: The patient remains hemodynamically and neurologically 
stable. Her EEG final read revealed (1) focal attenuation of 
background activity over the right posterior quadrant, and (2) 
intermittent focal slowing over the entire right hemisphere.  
These findings are consistent with cortical dysfunction over the 
right posterior brain, and focal subcortical dysfunction 
affecting the remainder of the right hemisphere.   There are no 
epileptiform discharges or seizures present.  She is stable and 
ready for discharge to rehabilitation facility for physical 
therapy.
