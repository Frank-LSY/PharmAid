1. Fluid within the small bowel and colon can be seen in the 
setting of  
gastroenteritis/diarrheal illness, nonspecific.  No evidence for 
bowel 
obstruction.

gastroenteritis/diarrheal illness.  No inflammation in the right

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a PMH notable for 
cholecystectomy in ___, who presented with abdominal pain and 1 
week of diarrhea that then became bloody, found to have 
eosinophilia.

# Abdominal Pain, Diarrhea, BRBPR
# Leukocytosis with Eosinophilia
# Metabolic Acidosis
Patient presented with one week of worsening watery diarrhea. On 
the night of admission developed BRBPR. In the span of one day 
(seen in ED two consecutive days), developed significant 
eosinophilia to 16.2% concerning for possible parasitic 
infection. Lactate normal. Remained afebrile. No significant 
risk factors for GI infectious etiologies other than two dogs at 
home that he feeds raw meat. Non-infectious causes for diarrhea 
include inflammatory bowel disease, but unlikely given history 
and acuity. Hgb did drop in the setting of BRBPR, but the drop 
most likely reflects hemodilation w/ IVFs after 
hemoconcentration from volume loss. Hgb stabilized in the ___. 
Stool studies were negative at time of d/c, but some were still 
pending, please f/u. Loperamide was started on hospital day 2. 
Patient w/ minimal nausea and abdominal pain throughout 
admission, tolerated solids and liquids well. Given the 
persistent eosinophilia, GI was consulted re: the need to do a 
colonoscopy, specifically to r/o eosinophilic enteritis. They 
did not find any indication to perform an inpatient scope, but 
will see him as an outpatient and may perform a colonoscopy at 
that time if still appropriate.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] f/u final stool studies, including strongyloides IgG
[ ] f/u with PCP in next month for repeat CBC to ensure 
eosinophilia resolved
[ ] patient should f/u with GI in the next ___ weeks to 
determine if need colonoscopy to r/o eosinophilic enteritis

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for having severe diarrhea 
that had recently turned bloody.  We tested your stool for 
infection, all those tests were negative at the time you were 
discharged. You will be notified if any of them turn out to be 
positive.  We gave you fluids through your IV, and then gave you 
anti-diarrhea medications to control your symptoms. We had the 
gastroenterology (GI) doctors ___, and they did not think 
that they needed to scope you urgently while you were in the 
hospital. Instead, they will see you as an outpatient, and will 
consider doing a colonoscopy at that time.

We wish you the best of health,
Your ___ Care Team
