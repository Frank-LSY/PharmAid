ERCP:
Limited exam of the esophagus was normal

The CBD was successfully cannulated ith the CleverCut 3V 
sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025in guidewire.

Contrast injection revealed a severely dilated CBD to the level 
of the ampulla to approximately 25mm in diameter and several 
large filling defects consistent with stones in the proximal, 
mid and distal CBD.
