FINDINGS:  
  
There is no evidence of acute major vascular territory 
infarction,hemorrhage,edema, or mass.  The ventricles and sulci
are normal in 
size and configuration.  Mild periventricular and subcortical
white-matter 
hypodensities are nonspecific, but may reflect the sequela of
chronic 
microvascular infarction. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  Mucous retention cysts are

Final Report 
EXAMINATION:  CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Q311 CT SPINE 
  
INDICATION:  History: ___ with agitation, fall// CXR- please 
eval
for PNA, 
effusion, rib fracture ___- please eval for large bleed,
infarct, mass 
C-spine- please eval for fracture or misalignment 
  
COMPARISON:  None. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
There is an acute mildly displaced fracture of the anterior
superior aspect of 
C6 vertebral body (602:32).  There is mild associated
prevertebral soft tissue 
swelling.  Alignment is maintained.  Mild to moderate multilevel
degenerative 
changes are seen with mild intervertebral disc space narrowing
and anterior 
and posterior osteophyte formation.  There is mild spinal canal
narrowing due 
to multilevel posterior osteophytes, probable ossification of 
the
posterior 
longitudinal ligament, and disc bulges with contact upon the
spinal cord, 
worst at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7.  Multilevel uncovertebral and 
facet
joint 
arthropathy is seen without evidence neural foraminal stenosis. 
There is no 
evidence of infection or neoplasm.  Bilateral scarring is seen 
in
the 
visualized lung apices.  The thyroid gland is unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Acute mildly displaced fracture of the anterior superior
aspect of the C6 
vertebral body.  Mild prevertebral soft tissue swelling raises
concern for 
ligamentous injury and further assessment with MRI of the
cervical spine is 
recommended. 
2. Mild to moderate cervical spondylosis. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  A dedicated C-spine MRI is recommended for
further 
evaluation for ligamentous injury. 
EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph 
  
COMPARISON:  None. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Mild loss of volume in in the left lung is reflected in 
elevation
of the left hemidiaphragm and bronchovascular crowding. There
could explain mild  peribronchial opacification centrally. 
Alternatively the patient may be splinting or may have 
aspirated.
Repeat chest radiograph should be obtained in 
12 hours.  Right lung is fully expanded and clear. 
  
Distension of the upper esophagus is noted.  Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is otherwise normal. There is no pleural abnormality. 

  
 Although no acute or other chest wall lesion is seen,
conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection
or characterizationof most such abnormalities. If the
demonstration of trauma or other soft tissue abnormality 
involving the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location 
of
any referable focal findings  should be clearly marked and 
imaged
with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning. 
TECHNIQUE: AP supine view of abdomen 
  
COMPARISON: None available 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
There are no abnormally dilated loops of large or small bowel. 
Assessment for free intraperitoneal air is limited on supine
radiographs. If there is clinical concern for pneumoperitoneum,
advise upright or left lateral 
decubitus radiograph, or cross-sectional imaging. 
Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
There are no unexplained soft tissue calcifications or 
radiopaque
foreign bodies. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of 
obstruction.

2. Assessment for free intraperitoneal air is limited on supine
radiographs.  If there is clinical concern for pneumoperitoneum,
upright or left lateral decubitus radiograph or cross-sectional
imaging can be obtainedfor further evaluation. 
EXAMINATION:  PELVIS AP ___ VIEWS 
  
COMPARISON:  None 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
No radiopaque foreign bodies are seen.  No acute fractures or
dislocations. 
There are moderate degenerative changes of bilateral hip joints
seen.  Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern is noted.  There also
degenerative changes of the visualized lower lumbar spine noted. 

  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No radiopaque foreign body seen in the pelvis. 
EXAMINATION:  MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST ___ MR ___ SPINE 
  
COMPARISON:  CT of the C-spine dated ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Moderately compromised exam secondary to motion. 
  
There is straightening of the normal cervical lordosis. 
  
Edema is seen involving the anteroinferior aspect of C5 and
anterior aspect of C6.  Refer to CT for fracture description. 
Evaluation of ligamentous 
integrity is suboptimal given motion.  Very mild prevertebral
edema at C5 level.  No definite evidence of epidural fluid
collection.  Cord is suboptimally evaluated. 
  
Multilevel mild disc osteophyte complex C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7
levels contributes to probably mild central canal narrowing, no
cord flattening. Central canal is patent at other levels. 
Central canal is best evaluated on series 8. 
  
Posterior element hypertrophic changes.  Evaluation of foramina
is difficult secondary to motion probably moderate left C4-C5
foraminal narrowing. Probably multilevel mild foraminal 
narrowing
at other levels. 
  
Paranasal sinus disease. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Moderately compromised exam from motion artifact. 
2. Edema involving the anterior aspect of C5 and C6 vertebral
bodies. 
3. Motion prevents adequate evaluation of ligaments. 
Degenerative
changes. Probably mild central canal narrowing.

a S21 from ___ in the setting of 2 mechanical falls
leading to a C6 c-spine fracture. 

At the time of admission to ___, presentation notable for
paranoia with hyperreligious content and report that he has not
been adherent to medications. Lab work also notable for
subtherapeutic level of valproic acid. MSE notable for 
tangential
thought process with loosening of associations, disorganization,
thought blocking, poor insight and limited judgment. 
Presentation
suggestive of acute decompensation of underlying primary
psychotic disorder.

DSM 5 DIAGNOSES:
- schizophrenia

#Legal/Safety:
Admitted to ___ on CV, form was signed and accepted by 
admitting psychiatrist on ___. Was placed on 15 minute 
checks, had monitored access to sharps, remained unit restricted 
due to acuity of symptoms initially as well as concerns due to 
mechanical fall while at ___ which resulted in C-spine 
fracture requiring ongoing use of a neck brace per orthopedic 
surgery. By time of discharge, patient was in good behavioral 
control and did not display any signs/behaviors concerning for 
safety.

#Psychosis:
Patient was provided with individual, group, milieu, and 
occupational therapy on a daily basis and was given treatment in 
a multidisciplinary team approach. He was resumed on his home 
psychiatric regimen of divalproex ___ 250mg po bid, citalopram 
40mg po daily, benztropine 0.5mg po qhs, olanzapine 5mg po 
daily, and olanzapine 25mg po qhs which was increased to 30mg po 
qhs on ___ as he was noted to remain guarded, paranoid, had 
delusional thought with hyperreligious themes, and also was not 
sleeping at night, remaining awake through the majority of the 
late evening. He tolerated the dose increase well without 
concerning side effects and showed some improvement in sleep at 
nighttime. By time of discharge, patient did not have overt 
paranoid/delusional thought content but remained somewhat 
disorganized with poor insight into his medical/psychiatric 
condition. However, it was believed that the patient has 
longstanding chronic schizophrenia and with the mood symptoms 
under better control, as well as having no overt agitation or 
acute psychotic decompensation, with enough organization in his 
thought process to be able to tend to his ADLs, that he was 
close to baseline. He remained pleasant, cooperative with 
medications, and although he did appear at times internally 
preoccupied or responding to internal stimuli, he denied any 
hallucinations and denied feeling unsafe. He continued to report 
complaints about how his neighbors do not speak to him at home, 
but that he does not intend to let this bother him as he felt 
that he had a good support group through his church 
congregation. Safety was further evaluated regarding his 
home/neighborhood situation with extensive questioning regarding 
whether the patient felt unsafe or harassed by his neighbors, 
which the patient denied. Patient was also extensively focused 
from the beginning of the admission on wanting a male case 
worker from ___ as he felt that he would be better able to 
connect and relate to a male case worker. By day of discharge, 
patient was overall euthymic, reactive appropriately, coherent, 
tending to his ADLs, displaying future/goal oriented thought 
process (was thinking about contacting ___ for filing a 
complaint due to the fall at ___), and denied SI/HI/AVH. 

#Insomnia:
Patient did not initially sleep much throughout the nighttime, 
often falling asleep during the day, and staying awake overnight 
mostly snacking/eating in the day room. Patient was provided 
with psychoeducation regarding the importance of limiting 
stimuli in eveningtime and to practice good sleep hygiene, which 
he did not display much interest in. Patient was offered 
ramelteon 8mg po qhs as well as lorazepam 1mg po qhs to help 
faciliate sleep, in addition to having the evening dose of 
olanzapine increased as documented above. Patient had a moderate 
response to these approaches, but still was noted by the evening 
team for staying up on some nights to snack/eat. By time of 
discharge, patient was rested enough in the mornings to be 
participating in the milieu and ADLs without falling asleep or 
needing excessive daytime napping.

#C6 osteophyte fracture:
Patient presented from ___ after mechanical 
fall(s), per evaluation in the ED by orthopedic surgery and per 
imaging, patient was found to have a C6 osteophyte fracture. Per 
recommendations by orthopedic surgery, no surgical interventions 
were pursued at this time, and a c-collar was worn by the 
patient at all times throughout the inpatient hospitalization. 
He had a follow-up c-spine XR 2 weeks since initially being seen 
in the ED by orthopedics, and the follow-up XR was consistent 
with the previously diagnosed C6 anterior osteophyte fracture. 
CT of head in the ED was negative for acute intracranial 
pathology, while CT of the spine was positive acute mildly 
displaced fx of anterior superior aspect of C6 vertebral body. 
MRI showed edema of involving the anterior aspects of C5 and C6 
vertebral bodies. ___ on day of discharge, patient was seen 
by orthopedic surgery and was instructed to keep the C-collar on 
at all times until his follow-up appointment with Dr. ___ in 
the outpatient clinic and to return to the ED for immediate 
evaluation if he begins to develop numbness/tingling in his 
extremities or develops urinary/fecal incontinence.

#HTN:
Patient was resumed on his home regimen of lisinopril 40mg po 
daily as well as amlodipine 5mg po daily. HCTZ was held in the 
ED and was held throughout the admission as there were some 
concerns that the mechanical fall at ___ may have been 
secondary to orthostatic hypotension and per the discussion with 
medical team in the ED, BP was thought to only be mildly 
elevated and that there were no clear benefits from having a 
triple agent therapy, especially with the data from the 
ACCOMPLISH trial. However, nearing the time of discharge, 
patient's blood pressure was noted to be consistently 
hypertensive, with SBPs running usually between 160 to 180, with 
DBPs 60 to 80. Per discussion with the Medicine consult team, 
amldoipine was increased by 2.5mg initially, which patient was 
able to tolerate without issues but still with hypertension 
without much improvement, and by time of discharge, amlodipine 
was increased to 10mg po daily with plan for outpatient primary 
care follow-up and management as indicated.

#HLD:
Home regimen of atorvastatin 80mg po daily. 

#?PAD:
At time of admission, patient had bilateral ___ edema, mild 
erythema, and difficult to palpate dorsalis pedal pulses. 
Throughout the admission, there were no signs/symptoms 
concerning for acute workup/interventions (e.g., DVTs). A small 
skin break was noted on RLE which was managed with dressing and 
topical antibiotic cream.

#Social work/dispo:
Treatment team worked to set-up the patient with a male ___ case 
worker, as well as setting him up with appointments with his 
psychiatrist and PCP.

On the discharge day, Mr. ___ reported "feeling alright...meds are 
OK". He denied any complains. He described mood as "good". He 
denied any side effects from medications. He reported that he 
slept well. He denied any pain/N/V/D/C/fever/chills/light 
headedness.

Writer shared with pt that ___ investigator (Mr. ___ 
___ wanted to speak with him (re. incident in 
the outside hospital). Mr. ___ agreed to do that. Pt asked 
that writer provides Mr. ___ with pt's contact info 
(___). That info was forwarded per pts reqst.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
By time of discharge, patient does remain at an elevated risk of 
harm to self due to the following static factors: chronic mental 
illness, male gender, age, marital status (single), chronic 
medical illness. Modifiable risk factors that were addressed 
during this admission include the following: psychosis (by time 
of discharge, was no longer having overtly/acutely decompensated 
psychotic symptoms and was linear/organized enough to tend to 
ADLs without issues and able to show good behavioral control 
despite having what appears to be chronic and ongoing 
hyperreligious delusions), medication noncompliance (by time of 
discharge, patient had been consistently taking medications and 
will be discharged with enough supplies of medications to bridge 
until both his PCP and outpatient psychiatrist appointment), 
lack of engagement with outpatient treatment (was made 
outpatient follow-up appointments for both PCP and 
psychiatrist), agitation/recklessness (was calm and behaving 
without safety issues), social withdrawal (patient was seen 
interacting appropriately in the milieu and with staff and 
participating in some groups), insomnia (had increased doses of 
nighttime medications as well as having lorazepam at ___ started 
as documented above). Patient also noted to have the following 
protective factors at time of discharge which may help to 
mitigate the above mentioned risk factors such as help-seeking 
nature, future/goal oriented thought, life satisfaction, 
spirituality, no irritability/agitation, no recent loss, no 
rage/anger/revenge, lack of suicidal ideation. 

Prognosis remains guarded due to the longstanding history and 
the difficult to control chronic psychosis that patient has, 
however, by time of discharge, treatment team determined that 
the patient is reasonably psychiatrically/medically stabilized 
to continue receiving care in the outpatient setting.
