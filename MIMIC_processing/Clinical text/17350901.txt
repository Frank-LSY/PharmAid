Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Slurred speech, R arm ataxia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV tPA
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old ambidextrous F PMHx cigarette
smoking (quit 15 days ago, >30 pack yr history), untreated HTN,
chronic vertigo and recent episode of R arm weakness (~2 weeks
ago, MRI negative, see details below) who presents with 
transient
RUE ataxia and dysarthria.

On the day of presentation, pt awoke around 6a feeling like her
usual self. She made her bed uneventfully. As she was getting
ready to shower around 6a, she suddenly felt dizzy. This was
described as a constant room spinning sensation exacerbated by
head movement. This felt similar to her prior episodes of 
vertigo
(she has had chronic vertigo for ___ years) but different in that
she felt "off". She had to sit down on the bed and called for 
her
son. Her right arm then started trembling and shaking. The son
observed this and she maintained awareness. This lasted about 15
seconds and had never happened before. EMS was then called.

En route to the hospital, her speech became slurred. She felt is
was "hard to make a sentence" and "get my words out". She had to
speak slowly and reported having some word finding difficulty as
well. She understood what was going on around her. 

Pt arrived at ___ at 6:45a. VS: ___ F (36.1 C), 68, 18,
130/70, O2 sat 100%. NIHSS 2 for R arm drift and R FNF 
dysmetria.
NCHCT unremarkable. Tele-stroke consulted who recommended tPA,
which was given at 9:05a. Pt then transferred to ___ for
further management.

En route to ___, she became nauseous and vomited x1. She was
given an anti-emetic. She also developed a holocephalic 
pulsating
headache. She denied any photo- or phonophobic but does have a
history of migraines with similar characteristics (none
recently). 

At the time of my assessment, her speech difficulties and R arm
ataxia +/- weakness had improved. She continued to have a
headache but the nausea had resolved. Repeat ___ and CTA H/N
were unremarkable. 

Of note, on ___ she developed a dental abscess on the left
side. On ___, she had a fever (101.5 per pt) and she called 
her
dentist who prescribed Keflex. She is currently completing this
course.

Also, she was hospitalized at ___ from ___ with 
a
similar event. Pt reports having sudden onset of a "dead right
arm" while she was reaching for a door. These symptoms resolved
after ~1hr. She also felt that the R side of her face was
drooping during this episode. She was admitted to ___
where she had an unremarkable MRI head and normal TSH/cortisol.
She was diagnosed with possible carpal tunnel syndrome with a
"low index of suspicion for TIA. No further workup indicated 
from
a neurologic standpoint. Recommended a splint for the right 
arm."

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old ambidextrous woman with a history 
of smoking (quit 2 weeks ago, >30 pack yr history), possible 
HTN, chronic vertigo and a recent episode of R arm weakness (~2 
weeks ago, MRI negative) who presented with transient right 
sided and dysarthria. She received IV tPA on ___ and her 
symptoms resolved. Neurologic exam is now improved. Brain MRI 
shows an infarct in right cerebellum and no complications from 
tPA. Etiology of her stroke is unknown. Her echo was negative 
for a PFO. No atrial fibrillation has been detected. She may 
have a family history of hypercoagulability (mother is on 
___ for "thick blood" and has had miscarriages). 
Antiphospholipid antibody tests were sent and pending at the 
time of discharge. She will also need further cardiac monitoring 
with ___ of Hearts monitor.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- follow up antiphospholipid antibodies
- should have further cardiac monitoring outpatient with ___ of 
hearts
- recommend genetic hypercoagulability testing outpatient 
(Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin Gene Mutation)
- incidental pulmonary nodule was found on imaging: In the case 
of nodule size <= 4 mm: For high risk patients, recommend 
follow-up at 12 months and if no change, no further imaging 
needed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right arm clumsiness 
and slurred speech resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms. You received tPA which is a 
clot busting medication which helped improve blood flow to the 
brain and resolve neurologic symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
Possible Hypertension  
Possible family history of clotting disorder
Elevated cholesterol 
Smoking History

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- starting aspirin 81mg daily
- starting Atorvastatin 40 mg daily
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. 
For Event Monitor ___) scheduling, call ___. 
 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
