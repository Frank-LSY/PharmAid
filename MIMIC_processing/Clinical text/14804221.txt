Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
left partial
nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; 
please see dictated operative note for details. The patient 
received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient was 
transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable condition. On 
POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated for urine output 
>30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and incentive 
spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient ambulated, 
restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel and 
complete blood count were checked, pain control was transitioned 
from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a clears/toast 
and crackers diet. On POD2, JP and urethral Foley catheter were 
removed without difficulty and diet was advanced as tolerated. 
The remainder of the hospital course was relatively 
unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable condition, 
eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without 
difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, 
incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit 
instructions to follow-up in clinic in approximately four weeks 
time.
