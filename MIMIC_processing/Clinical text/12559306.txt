Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of opioid use 
disorder in remission, depression, hypertriglyceridemia, and 
tobacco use disorder who was referred to the ED by her PCP for 
tachycardia and an elevated D-dimer. She was found to have a 
small segmental PE. Also with an odd constellation of new 
symptoms including recent facial and truncal macular/acneiform 
rash, new bilateral ___ edema and hand puffiness, aphthous 
ulcers, polyarthralgias, and pharyngitis.

# RLL segmental PE
This preliminarily appears to be an unprovoked PE. She does not 
take OCPs and is not currently pregnant. When her labs were last 
checked, her folate level was undetectable. It is unclear why 
her folate level would be so low as she does not have an alcohol 
use disorder and has no dietary restrictions. Perhaps elevated 
homocysteine levels in the setting of folate deficiency could 
have predisposed her to thrombosis? Beta-2-Glycoprotein 
antibodies and cardiolipin antibodies were sent and are pending. 

She was started on warfarin 5 mg daily with a lovenox bridge 
(her health insurance generally does not approve DOACs without a 
warfarin failure). She was treated with Lovenox, which will be 
continued to therapeutic INR. She will be followed at ___ 
___ clinic, and arrangements were made for her to 
get her INRs checked at ___, which is closer to her 
home.
Unless her odd constellation of symptoms is found to be a 
reversible process that could potentially explain her VTE, she 
will likely need lifelong anticoagulation.

# Bilateral ___ edema
Non-pitting lower extremity edema and puffy hands in a pattern 
clinically more suggestive of myxedema than anything else, 
although TSH was not abnormal. LENIs were negative for DVT 
bilaterally. JVP and BNP were low and TTE was unremarkable, so 
CHF is excluded. LFTs are within normal limits and she has no 
history of chronic liver disease. No proteinuria, so nephrotic 
syndrome is excluded. She had been trying Lasix and NSAIDs for 
the swelling previously, but was counseled that these are both 
unlikely to help and was given compression stockings. 

# Polyarthralgias 
# Pustular rash
# Aphthous ulcers
The patient was seen by rheumatology, who suspected a viral 
syndrome; they comment that SLE could explain some of the 
symptoms, and also comment that while Behcet's may present with 
oral ulcer associated with VTE, it is vanishingly rare in 
patient's of ___ heritage. Seen by ID who did not feel that 
the rash was typical of any viral exanthem, but wondered if it 
could be an unusual presentation of a drug rash.  
If these symptoms do not continue to improve or are recurrent, 
would consider working
up for a rheumatologic process. 
___ negative, CRP not elevated, HIV negative, Lyme negative, HCV 
and HBV negative, VZV negative, monospot negative. RPR, EBV, 
parvovirus B19,  dsDNA are pending.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a pulmonary embolism, or blood clot that 
went to the lung. We are giving you warfarin (Coumadin) to thin 
your blood for at least the next three months. You will take 
twice daily enoxaparin (Lovenox) shots for a few days until the 
warfarin has fully taken effect. We follow a measure of blood 
clotting called INR to know if warfarin is being dosed 
appropriately. A therapeutic INR is between 2.0 and 3.0. 

You will be followed by the ___ clinic at ___, 
which is affiliated with your PCP ___.  However, you 
can get your INR checked at ___. Just go to 
pre-admissions testing which near the main entrance, 
downstairs near ___. When the lab result comes back, 
you will be called by the pharmacist in town to adjust your 
warfarin dose as needed. 

Your first INR check will be on ___.  They tell me there will 
be a standing order for labs in place and ___ will be 
expecting you, but I have also given you a paper script for 
bloodwork just in case. 

You also had a variety of unusual symptoms that may have been 
symptoms a virus, an adverse reaction to a medication, 
deficiency of the vitamin folic acid, or an autoimmune disease. 
We went a very large number of tests to figure out what might be 
going on. I will call you if anything really notable comes back 
positive. If the symptoms persist, you have an appointment with 
Dr. ___ rheumatology to do further workup. If the 
symptoms all go away, then it was unlikely to have been an 
autoimmune disease and you are welcome to cancel this 
appointment  (___).

 
Followup Instructions:
