Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a significant 
smoking history (50 pack years) and high cholesterol, as well as 
a family history of early stroke, who is admitted to the 
Neurology stroke service with dysarthria secondary to an acute 
ischemic stroke in the left frontoparietal cortex. Her stroke 
was most likely secondary to an embolic event given its 
location, appearance and her risk factors. Her hemoglobin a1c 
was 5.7 and LDL 131. She was not previously on aspirin, Plavix, 
or statins. Her deficits resolved completely prior to discharge 
without any residual symptoms. She is back at her baseline. We 
encouraged her to quit smoking and discharged her with nicotine 
patches to help her quit. Echo revealed no structural cause of 
embolism. Telemetry did not capture any a fib events. We 
considered hypercoaguability as a possible cause of her stroke, 
and ordered beta-2-glycoprotein and anticardiolipin, and lupus 
anticoagulant for part of this workup, which were pending at 
discharge. She will need continued telemetry monitoring, and we 
have ordered an outpatient holter monitor that she will pick up 
after discharge. Of note, during her hospitalization workup she 
was found incidentally to have a small 2mm MCA aneurysm at the 
bifurcation, for which no surgical intervention was warranted 
and we recommended a follow up CTA of the brain in 6 months, 
which will be ordered at her follow up stroke neurology 
appointment. Referral to neurosurgery will be considered at that 
time. 

# Scattered punctate infarcts, left frontoparietal regions
- Atorvastatin 40, Aspirin 81
- Please call ___ to schedule your outpatient cardiac 
monitor for continued monitoring of your heart rhythm

# Cerebral Aneurysm
- 2mm R MCA bifurcation aneurysm
- Incidentally discovered on CTA, no indication for surgical 
intervention
- Follow up CTA in 6 months, follow up in stroke neurology 

Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 5.7%
2) Mild intracranial atherosclerosis - mild atherosclerotic 
calcifications of the cavernous internal carotid arteries
3) Hyperlipidemia: well controlled on Atorvastatin 40 with LDL 
130
4) Obesity
5) An echocardiogram did not show a PFO on bubble study

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of speech difficulty 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
high cholesterol, smoking

We are changing your medications as follows:
START Atorvastatin 40mg by mouth nightly
START Aspirin 81mg by mouth daily
START Nicotine patches

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
