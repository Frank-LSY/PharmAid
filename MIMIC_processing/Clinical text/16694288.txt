History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of depression, anxiety, panic
disorder, and ADHD who was brought to the hospital by his sister
for worsening depressive symptoms and increasing anxiety over 
the
past ___ years now with persistent passive suicidal ideation for
the past 3 weeks. 

On interview, patient describes feeling increasingly depressed
over the past year and a half, associated with rumination and a
feeling of "detachment". He states that four weeks ago, he and
his fianc√© broke up (this also caused him to become homeless
since they were living together - he has since been living with
friends and came to ___ to stay with his sister), because she
could not deal with his "detachment" anymore. He states that he
gets into an "anxious state" during which time he ruminates 
about
bad things in his life and worries about the future and feels a
pit in his stomach, and he feels that he "detaches" from reality
at these times. He notes that over the past weekend prior to
coming to the ___ he was unable to get rid of the pit in his
stomach or stop ruminating.

He reports difficulties focusing at work, difficulty with short
term memory which is bothersome and anxiety-provoking, new
cognitive difficulties including occasional dyslexia, poor sleep
(for which he takes Benadryl at home), anhedonia (not even able
to enjoy Patriot's games anymore), increasing social isolation
(including not spending times with friends and avoiding seeing
his son due to not wanting his son to see him depressed), and
passive suicidal thoughts ("I wish I could go to sleep and not
wake up"), though no active thoughts or plan. 

Per Dr. ___ dated ___: 

"He states that he disengaged with treatment approximately ___
years ago due to lack of insurance and has experienced a gradual
decompensation in his depression and anxiety.  More acutely, his
previous psychiatrist, whom he had seen for ___ years prior to 
his
retirement in ___, passed away one month ago.  The patient and
his girlfriend of ___ years also separated one month ago due to
the patient's worsening symptoms intolerable to his partner.

The patient reports worsening anhedonia (doesn't enjoy football,
writing the way he used to) and believes this is related to his
inability to concentrate.  He states that he spends hours 
sitting
in front of the computer screen unable to type a single 
sentence.
He describes a sensation of feeling paralyzed, unable to think 
or
make decisions.  Previously a ___ and ___, this represents a drastic change from his
baseline which the patient finds terribly distressing.  He has
been unable to work at the level he once had and is currently
working on a handful of cases; he no longer has a steady source
of income.  He reports having allowed checks amounting to 
$25,000
and $11,000 to bounce and neglected to file a number of 
important
financial documents last year.  He is likewise "homeless",
staying with friends after breaking up with the girlfriend he 
had
previously shared a home with.  He struggles with impaired
memory, and likewise reports impaired motivation, spending hours
in the bed in the morning dreading the prospect of preparing for
the day.  He has stopped working out, "stopped taking care of
[him]self", and reports diminished appetite, disturbed sleep, 
and
decreased energy. He has for the last few weeks entertained
thoughts of "not wanting to wake up", and while he denies SI 
with
plan, states "I think it would be better if I just died".  He
ruminates on his short-comings and failures and engages in
increased negative self-talk.

Although he is "miserable", he in addition experiences great
guilt and shame at the relationships he has destroyed with his
son, his sisters, his mother, and his friends.  The depression
forces him to isolate and "avoid"; he says that he cannot bear 
to
talk to people, "make eye contact with people".  He becomes
acutely tearful at the mention of his son, saying "I've been a
shit father".  He and his wife are divorced and he previously
enjoyed custody of his son on ___ and weekends.  Over the
last several months, however, he has cut himself off from his
son, "embarrassed for him to see [him] like this".  This past
weekend he went to a hotel, alone, to "get away from everything"
and, uncharacteristically, had several drinks at the hotel bar,
"trying to put the fire out" (his anxiety).  He reported
increased SI yesterday and was hopeful that his feelings would
improve with sleep, but awoke this morning anxious, hopeless, 
and
miserable.  He called his sister, ___, who reported to this
writer that his illness has been "more than [she] can handle
alone" and brought him to the hospital for evaluation.

He first experienced a panic attack at the age of ___ (___), and
a generalized anxiety soon followed.  He and his now ex-wife, 
who
share a son, several years later struggled through the death of
twins born prematurely after being otherwise unable to conceive. 

Their relationship ended in divorce shortly thereafter, and it
was then that the patient began seeing Dr. ___ in ___.  Dr. ___ Adderall 40-80 mg daily for ADHD and Klonopin 0.5-1.5
mg qHS for anxiety and panic disorder for a number of years; he
was trialed on but did not tolerate antidepressants, and these
were not a consistent component of his regimen.  The patient
reports being stable on Adderall and Klonopin without having
misused either medication- Adderall helped him to concentrate,
and Klonopin kept him "even".  After Dr. ___ in ___ 
the
patient's care was transferred to another provider but the
patient lost his insurance and was lost to follow-up in ___ 
of
___.  This provider did insist that the patient restart Prozac,
which had been somewhat beneficial in the past, but likewise
proposed the use of lithium, which made the patient angry, as he
denies that he may be bipolar.  He does deny symptoms of mania
and psychosis.  He does endorse "overwhelming" anxiety with 
daily
panic attacks that have recently worsened in frequency and
severity.  Despite medications having been beneficial in
controlling his symptoms in the past, the patient currently
denies hope for the future, unsure that his symptoms will ever
improve."  

Also of note, the patient states that while feeling down over 
the
weekend, he tried to look up Dr. ___, only to find that he had
passed away.

her this morning and said he "couldn't take it anymore." She 
told
him to come up and they would figure it out. Patient started
crying when he came to her house but didn't express thoughts of
suicide. Depression has been an issue for the patient for many
years, and that everyone once in a while when he gets like this
she "band-aids" him by giving him money or some klonopin. She
states that she doesn't think he is suicidal and that he doesn't

Brief Hospital Course:
When pt was evaluated in the ___, he was thought to be at 
increased risk of harm to self given his passive suicidal 
ideation, anger at hospital staff and history of impulsivity, 
and the degree of his depression including anhedonia, social 
isolation, poor sleep, difficulty concentrating and with memory, 
and difficulty caring for self (i.e. not maintaining car 
registration, health insurance, etc. due to lack of energy and 
motivation).  It was thought that he would benefit from a brief 
inpatient hospitalization for a more thorough 
diagnostic/psychosocial evaluation, initiation of medication, 
and aftercare planning. 

Team met with patient and found him to be cooperative. Despite 
his recent low mood and passive suicidal ideation, he denied any 
intent to harm himself and was future oriented, hopeful, very 
motivated to utilize medication/therapy to feel better.  He did 
not appear to be at imminent risk of harm to self and appeared 
safe to discharge to the community with use of his sister and 
new outpatient providers for support and monitoring. In 
addition, he was accepting of medication and so team started 
clonazepam 0.5 mg BID PRN and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg QAM to 
address his anxiety and depression, respectively. He was 
emphatic thet "this is a very bad place for me" and that while 
he wanted treatment he did not want to be in the hospital for 
even one night.

1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. He was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) As above; The patient was accepting of medication and so team 
started clonazepam 0.5 mg BID PRN and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg QAM 
to address his anxiety and depression, respectively. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) The patient was given nicotine lozenges PRN for nicotine 
cravings. 

4. MEDICAL
#)No acute medical issues arose. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
The patient's sister was contacted for collateral information 
and discharge planning.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Wellbutrin, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
Patient is future-oriented, non-hopeless, forthcoming, and 
entirely nonsuicidal.

Prognosis: good- likely to re-establish satisfying relationships 
with ongoing mental health outpatient treatment including 
therapy and psychopharm.
