starting Effexor and Hydroxyzine medication, and risks and 
benefits of possible alternatives, including not taking the 
medication, with this patient.  We discussed the patient's right

importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team, and I answered the patient's questions.  The

#RISK ASSESSMENT
Static risk factors include: Race, Age of onset, single, 
unemployed

We attempted to modify these risk factors during this admission. 
 We established outpatient PCP and psychiatry appointments to 
ensure aftercare after discharge. We involved patient's family 
in the treatment course to ensure social support. 

Protective risk factors include:
***help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, sense reality 
testing ability, fair coping skills, positive therapeutic 
relationship with outpatient providers, lack of suicidal 
ideation, and strong social supports.

Based on the totality of our assessment at this time, the 
patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others. 

# Prognosis
The clinical prognosis is guarded, given the fact that patient 
still has significant anxiety on the discharge. On positive 
site, this patient does not abuse substances, is not 
suicidal/homicidal, reports feeling better, compliant with 
medications, assessments, milieu. She has positive plans for 
future. 
While we were offering pt to extend hospital stay a little 
longer, there were no legal grounds to hold patient against her 
will. Also, family was involved in the d/c planning.
