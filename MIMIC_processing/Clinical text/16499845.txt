IMAGING
=======
___
CXR
IMPRESSION:  
  
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

CATH ___
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Â• Successful PCI with drug-eluting stent of the LAD coronary 
artery.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
=======
SUMMARY
=======
___ yo M with history of obesity, former smoker, HLD who 
presented with chest pain to PCP found to have abnormal ETT and 
PMIBI consistent with CAD of LAD likely missed MI. On transfer 
to ___ his cardiac biomarkers were negative and was without 
ECG changes, confirming missed MI.  On ___ he underwent 
coronary angiography and a 100% mid LAD occlusion was intervened 
upon with 1 DES.

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================
New Medications: Ticagrelor 90mg twice daily, Metoprolol 
succinate 25mg daily, Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
Stopped Medications: none
Changed Medications: Atorvastatin was increased to 80mg from 
40mg 

[] Please ensure patient taking all medications, especially DAPT
[] Lifestyle modifications to be reinforced

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#Unstable Angina and subacute, missed MI s/p DES to mid LAD
#HFrEF (LVEF 40%)
Patient presenting with abnormal stress test following typical 
anginal symptoms with cardiac risk factors. Initially had 
positive ETT with some STE, followed by PMIBI consistent with 
CAD of LAD with prior MI and ___ ischemia. Had normal 
EKG in ___.  Unclear if MI was 2 weeks ago during his chest 
pain or if had another episode after his pMIBI. Currently chest 
pain free.  TTE w/ LVEF 40% suggestive of ischemic damage and 
coronary angio ___ showed 100% stenosis of mid LAD that was 
treated with 1 DES.  He was also found to have a 70% occlusion 
of the diagonal which was not intervened upon.  Patient was 
discharged on DAPT (ticag 90 BID/ASA 81 daily), metop succinate 
25mg daily, and lisinopril 2.5mg daily. His atorvastatin was 
switched to 80mg daily; note his T Chol was 202, Trig 85, HDL 
46, and LDL-calc 139. Patient should have follow up TTE in the 
future to assess if cardiac function is improved after PCI and 
medical management.

#pAFib (ChadsVasc 1 for reduced EF)
On telemetry prior to coronary angiogram, patient was found to 
have intermittent episodes of Afib w/o RVR.  Reports having 
palpitations for a few months prior to hospitalization and a 
frequent coffee drinker.  He should undergo Zio patch monitoring 
as an outpatient.  Low risk of CVA thus AC not indicated.

Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
-You were found to have had a heart attack. Your heart arteries 
were examined (cardiac catheterization) which showed a complete 
blockage of one of the arteries. This was opened by placing a 
tube called a stent in the artery. You were given medications to 
prevent future blockages. You also were found to have a blockage 
in another one of your arteries that was deemed not to be the 
cause of the heart attack.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
-Please go to your doctor appointments as directed and take all 
medications as prescribed.
- It is very important to take your aspirin and ticagrelor (also 
known as Brilinta) every day.
- These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the 
heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart 
attack.

a blood clot forming in your heart stents and having another

as metoprolol and lisinopril
