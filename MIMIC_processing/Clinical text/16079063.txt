History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo w/ no PMH who is presenting with chest
tightness. 

The chest tightness began around 10 am in the morning. He has
previously had some intermittent chest pain that would go away 
on
its own. The current pain felt like a pressure or a plate was
pressing down on his chest and radiating to his back. He felt
short of breath, weak, and had a little nausea, no vomiting with
this episode.  He had teeth pain, no jaw pain. This pain did not
go away so he presented to the ___ for evaluation. There
they found that he had a troponin elevation and they sent him to
___ for further evaluation. He had a full dose aspirin and was
started on a heparin drip prior to transfer. He says his chest
pain dissipated around ___ pm upon presentation to the OSH. 

In our ___ the patient had stable VS, anxious affect, and no 
signs
of volume overload. His ECG showed NSR w/ normal intervals, no
elevations, depressions notable. 

- Labs/studies notable for: a troponin to 1.4, elevated LDL to
157, and HA1c of 5.5 WBC to 15.1. 

- Patient was continued on heparin and given a 1x 0.5 mg Ativan
dose. 

On the floor the patient confirms the above history. He says he
does not go to the doctor on ___ regular basis. He had a bad
experience getting an emergency appendectomy as a child and now
gets very anxious in hospitals and is concerned about whatever
intervention we are going to take. 

Of note he also notes occasional color changes in his hands to
white and blue. He says this is worse with the cold. About once 
a
month he gets achy joints that goes away after about a day. He
has never had any rashes. He has never gone to a doctor for 
this.
He also gets daily headaches that he drinks coffee for or takes
Excedrin. 

On ROS he denies fever, chills, dizziness, lightheadedness,
shortness of breath, cough, problems laying flat, poor exercise
tolerance, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, urinary
frequency, burning with urination.

IMAGING:
-----------

TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is mildly 
enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid
anteroseptum and distal anterior and lateral walls and apex (see 
schematic) and preserved/normal
contractility of the remaining segments. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal.
Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is 
55 %. There is no resting left
ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular 
cavity size with normal free wall motion.
The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal 
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The
aortic arch diameter is normal with a mildly dilated descending 
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. 
There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is mild [1+]
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and mild
regional dysfunction c/w LAD disease, with borderline ejection 
fraction. Normal right ventricular
size and free wall systolic function. Mild mitral and tricuspid 
regurgitation.

CARDIAC ECHO ___:
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel and is normal. This vessel
bifurcates into the Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex 
systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is
a 40% stenosis in the mid segment. There are several segments 
with mild irregularity and 30% stenosis
in the mid segment.
The ___ Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel and is normal.
The ___ Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a large 
caliber vessel. There is a 90% stenosis
in the proximal segment with associated thrombus.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel and is normal.
The Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel with mild
irregularities.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.

Findings
 Single vessel coronary artery disease.
 Successful PCI with drug-eluting stent of the second diagonal 
coronary artery.
Recommendations
 ASA 81mg per day indefinitely.
 Plavix 75mg/day for minimum 12 months
 Secondary prevention of CAD
 Further management as per primary cardiology team.

 
Brief Hospital Course:

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
========================
[] Had STEMI with DES placed to ___ diagonal, started on 
ASA/Plavix
[] Found to be hypertensive and started on metoprolol, ACEi

========================
BRIEF SUMMARY
========================

Mr. ___ is a ___ yo w/ no PMH who is presenting with chest 
pressure and elevated troponins. 

He initially had no EKG changes but started having evolving ST 
elevations in leads 1, AVL. As such, he was taken for cath and 
found to have a 90% second diagonal lesion (large caliber 
vessel) with superimposed thrombus treated with PCI and a 
drug-eluting stent. He was also found to have non obstructive 
___ disease in his LAD. An ECHO showed a preserved EF with 
mild LVH and mild regional wall dysfunction.

He was discharged to home on medical therapy and will follow up 
with his PCP and new cardiologist.

gtt. Troponins
peaked at 2.40. Underwent cath ___ with DES placed in diagonal 
for 90% occlusion. Patient discharged on ASA, atorva 80, Plavix,
