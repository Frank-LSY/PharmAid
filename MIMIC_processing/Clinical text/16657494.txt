IMAGING:
========
Abd u/s ___ (___) 
IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis. Dilated bile ducts raising suspicion
for distal CBD stone or obstructing mass. CT abdomen/pelvis
scheduled to follow for further evaluation.

CT A/P ___ (___) 
IMPRESSION: Large lobulated low-density tumor in the right lobe
of the liver encasing the gallbladder, extending to the porta
hepatis obstructing the CHD with dilated intrahepatic bile 
ducts.
Differential diagnosis includes gallbladder CA with direct
extension into the liver, Klatskin biliary duct tumor and
metastatic tumor.

CXR ___ (___) 
Conclusion: Normal chest. No active/acute chest disease.

PROCEDURES:
===========
ERCP ___:
Impression: The scout film was normal. The major papilla was 
normal.
The CBD was successfully cannulated using a Rx sphincterotome 
preloaded with 0.025in guidewire.
Contrast injection revealed a 1.5cm upper CHD stricture up to 
the level of bidurcation. The right and left IHDs were dilated.
A small biliary sphicnterotomy was successfully performed at 
the 12 o'clock position. There was no post-sphincterotomy 
bleeding.
Occlusion cholangiogram confirmed the CHD stricture with 
dilation of the IHDs.
Multiple brushings were obtained from the CHD stricture and 
sent for cytology.
The CHD stricture was successfully dilated using a 6mm x 4cm 
Hurricane balloon. 
A ___ x 5cm plastic double pigtail stent was successfully 
placed in the left IHD across the CHD stricture.
There was excellent bile and contrast drianage at the end of

Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx breast ca (s/p mastectomy, chemo, rads), hx bladder ca 
(s/p local excision and IFN/BCG), Htn, HLD, obesity, hx 
cholelithiasis, neuropathy now presents with 2 weeks of RUQ 
discomfort and vomiting, found to have elevated LFT's and 
painless jaundice with liver mass encasing GB. 

#RUQ discomfort and vomiting, ___
#Liver mass encasing GB with CHD obstruction and intrahepatic
bile duct dilation
#Painless jaundice
#Elevated LFT's 
Presentation and labs/imaging consistent with mass of liver with 
GB involvement (differential includes, primary gallbladder ca, 
klatskin tumor, vs. metastatic lesion). LFT's markedly elevated 
consistent with biliary obstruction.  She underwent ERCP on 
___ which showed a CHD stricture which was dilated, and a 
stent placed.  Brushings of the CHD stricture were taken and 
pathology is pending.  Pt was doing well post-procedure with no 
further n/v/abdominal pain on discharge.  Post-procedural LFT's 
also downtrended.  Pt will get called with results of pathology 
from brushing and f/u and further management of the tumor will 
be decided based on pathology (new hepatobiliary primary vs. 
mets).  She was also discharge to complete 5 day course of 
ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.

Billing: Greater than 30 minutes spent on discharge counseling
