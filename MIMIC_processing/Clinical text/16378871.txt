History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a history of

was in his normal state of health until yesterday, when he felt
that he had a fever. Otherwise, he endorsed no other symptoms --
denied abdominal pain, diarrhea, though he did endorse an
unspecified amount of weight loss. Per chart review, his main
symptom was decreased consciousness.  He was brought to ___. There his temp was 102.1 and he required 3 L
O2. A bedside ultrasound showed a dilated CBD. A CXR was read as
concerning for PNA, and he was started on levofloxacin and
vancomycin, as well as clindamycin. He received a CT which 
showed
mildly dilated intrahepatic, CBD, and pancreatic ducts. GI at 
___ was consulted, who recommended transfer to ___ for ERCP.
Otherwise, he had a run of NSVT. Labs at OS___ showed BUN/Cr

IMAGING
-------
ERCP ___:
The scout film was normal. 
Dark bile was draining from the major papilla. 
The CBD was successfully cannulated using a Rx sphincterotome 
preloaded with 0.035in guidewire. 
Contrast injection revealed a 1cm mid-upper CBD stricture with 
dilation of the upper CBD at approximately 15mm in diameter. 
Given the anticoagulation status of the patient the decision 
was made not to perform biliary sphincterotomy. 
Multiple brushings were obtained from the stricture and sent 
for cytology. 
A ___ x 7cm straight plastic CBD stent was successfully placed 
in the CBD across the stricture. 
There was excellent bile and contrast drianage at the end of 
the procedure. 

CTA pancreas ___:
1. Suspected 1.5 x 1.3 cm hypoenhancing pancreatic head mass 
abutting the CBD stent and portal vein.  There is mild 
dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, measuring up to 0.5 cm 
with relative atrophy of the more distal pancreas.  Correlation 
with cytology from the CBD brushings is recommended. 
2. There is moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation and a new 
CBD stent.  The gallbladder is diffusely dilated, measuring up 
to 11.7 x 8.5 cm, previously 11.6 x 7.3 cm. 
3. Unchanged left lower lobe ground-glass opacity and 
consolidation, 
concerning for aspiration or pneumonia in the correct clinical 
setting. 
4. The rectum and sigmoid colon are diffusely distended with 
stool.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with end-stage ___ disease requiring 
tube feeding, atrial fibrillation and pulmonary embolism on 
chronic anticoagulation, who presented with cholangitis and 
found to have a stricture and pancreatic head mass, concerning 
for pancreatic cancer.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Cholangitis
# Bile duct obstruction
# Pancreatic duct stricture, concerning for cancer: presented 
with fevers and chills, evidence of cholangitis, and underwent 
ERCP which revealed stricture with plastic stent placed.  
Discussed with oncology who recommended CTA pancreas to further 
evaluate.  LFTs downtrended after ERCP, and patient was placed 
on five days of ciprofloxaxcin.  CTA pancreas revealed a 
pancreatic head mass.  Brushings taken during ERCP are pending 
pathological analysis.  Pancreas Care was e-mailed and will 
contact the patient's health care proxy to schedule a 
multidisciplinary meeting.  He will require repeat ERCP in four 
weeks and will need to be off anticoagulation for this, to be 
scheduled by ERCP team.

# Atrial fibrillation on chronic anticoagulation
# History of pulmonary embolism: s/p FFP and Vit K for INR 8.1 
on admission. Repeat INR 1.5.  Warfarin 5 mg daily was started 
following ERCP.  INR was 1.6 on the day of discharge.  Warfarin 
should be continued and INR rechecked on ___ to assure INR 
goal of ___.

# End stage ___. Home Sinemet, gabapentin, and trazodone 
were continued.

# Depression. Home paroxetine was continued.

# Gout. Home colchicine was continued.

# GERD. Home famotidine was continued.

# Nutrition/Hydration: Tube feeds, 1.5 Jevity  240 mL QID, soft
foods for palliation

TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------
# Follow-up: Brushings were taken during ERCP are pending 
pathological analysis, which will need to be followed up.  
Pancreas Care was e-mailed and will contact the patient's health 
care proxy to schedule a multidisciplinary meeting after 
discharge.  He will require repeat ERCP in four weeks and will 
need to be off anticoagulation for this, to be scheduled by ERCP 
team.  INR should be rechecked on ___.

# Contacts/HCP/Surrogate and Communication: ___
___, discussed on ___
# Code Status/Advance Care Planning: FULL confirmed with patient
and on MOLST from ___ (please also see current POE order)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent stay at 
___.  You came for further evaluation of fevers and chills, 
and were found to have blockage of your common bile duct and 
subsequent infection.  An ERCP was performed and noted a mass on 
the head of your pancreas, and this was confirmed with a CT 
scan.  A stent was placed during your ERCP to relieve the 
obstruction.  Your infection improved with this intervention and 
with antibiotics.

It will be very important for you to follow up with our Pancreas 
Care center after your discharge, to follow up the biopsy that 
was taken of your pancreas, and for further planning for your 
care.

It is also important for you to take all medications as 
prescribed.

Good luck!
