History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a
history of head trauma with resulting impairment in memory and
personality changes, PTSD with recent recovered memories of 
___ depression, and extreme anxiety on neuropsych testing,
who was brought in by his wife due to increasingly more violent
and verbally abusive behavior, and suicidal ideation for several
months, now with more intent in the past few days.  The patient
reports that he was "in a bad mood all day."  He adds, "Anything
could set me off, tying my shoe . . . I go crazy," which he
explains could involve trying to throw himself out of the car
today and punching holes in the wall.  He reports that he would
like his "attitude" and "disposition" to get better.  He reports
that "suicide doesn't bother" him, but he worries about her and
believes that suicide would make his wife's life easier.  

Collateral from wife, interviewed individually in person:
___, wife, reports that the patient had a head injury about
___ years ago, resulting in a crushed sinus cavity, and he later
developed flat affect.  CT showed pituitary damage.  T4 and
testosterone were low, but he did well for about ___ years.  It
just came out in the past month or two that he was raped when he
was ___.  The patient stated to his wife that "it was always 
there
but he kind of suppressed it."  She said to him, "Smell that
breeze.  Summer's coming."  He got immediately upset and said
that he remembered everything that happened to him.  
He has had suicidal thoughts on and off for 16 months.  She
reports that his doctors feel ___ have been depressed for
most of his life, and it probably got worse after the head
injury.  She notices that he cries every morning when we wakes
up, thinks he's a burden and feels like he's ruining everybody's
lives.  

The patient tried multiple medications but got no relief from 
his
depressive symptoms.  A genetic study showed that  he is a slow
metabolizer, which she believes meant that he had toxic levels 
in
his blood and was not getting therapeutic events.  She reports
that he does very well with the structure of work, and he "falls
apart" on the weekend.  He is on vacation this week.  

He was frustrated today because he was telling people that he
needed his snowblower repaired when he was talking about his
lawnmower.  She states that she may have to explain things to 
him
10 times.  She reports that he says, "I just want to be normal." 

He will "talk backwards" when he is tired, which she says 
doesn't
make sense.  He is aware of this.  He is very verbally abusive,
which she says is "not [her] husband."  She notes that this has
been going on since the abuse was uncovered.  She reports that 
he
is getting more and more violent.  He threw a coffee table, and
he picked her up when she tried to block him from leaving the
house to go kill himself.  Today, he told her to get out of his
way.  He states, "If you don't get out of my way, I'm putting
your head through that f-ing wall."  He also tried to jump out 
of
the car today while they were driving.  

His wife also reports that he will be stabilized on medications
and then will stop taking them due to sexual side effects.

Brief Hospital Course:
SAFETY:  The patient was placed on 15 minute checks on admission 
and remained here on that level of observation throughout. He 
was cooperative with all regulations while on the ward.

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Anxiety, Mood Disorder, and history of sexual abuse
     On admission, the patient was noted to be cooperative and 
euthymic.  His wife provided us with the genetic testing which 
revealed CYP metabolic variants which could impact certain 
medications pharmacokinetics.  Our interview with the patient 
revealed greater concern for anxiety and impulse disorder rather 
than depression, as well as concern for possible SSRI related 
side-effects secondary to the altered metabolism of these drugs 
in a patient with CYP genetic variants.  As a result during 
hospitalization, we discontinued the patient's SSRI and Remeron 
(as his wife noted adverse reaction to this in the past as 
well).  We initiated nadalol and changed clonazepam from PRN to 
standing with a PRN dose for anxiety.  These interventions had 
good effect.  After the weekend, the patient was intended to 
begin on a mood stabilizer medication such as valproic acid, but 
due to his and his wife's objections and interest in discharge, 
such intervention was not employed. 

On discharge, the patients mood was stable, and mental status 
exam was pertinent for intact cognition and euthymic mood.

MEDICAL:
#) Pituitary Hormone deficiency:
Due to the history of prior injury to the pituitary, all labs 
were sent to evaluate posterior and anterior function.  
TSH/T4/T3 were all within reference range with Synthroid 
maintained over the course of the patient's inpatient stay.  
Testosterone and Free Testosterone were bottom normal and low 
range.  All other assays of pituitary function were within 
reference ranges.

#) Endocrine:
MetFORMIN XR was continued along with fingersticks to manage 
blood sugars for history of diabetes

PSYCHOSOCIAL: 
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  The patient was encouraged to participate in 
units groups/milieu/therapy opportunities. Use of coping skills 
and mindfulness/relaxation methods were encouraged. The patient 
was highly animated, euthymic, and participatory in the milieu. 
The patient was very visible on the unit and frequently had 
conversations with his/her peers. He/She attended some groups. 
He/She never engaged in any unsafe behaviors. The patient ate 
all meals in the milieu, slept well, and cooperated with unit 
rules. Therapy addressed family/social/work issues.  Patient and 
family were involved in family meetings focused on 
psychoeducation and discharge planning.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS: 
We requested records from the patient's wife who provided 
history and genetic panel.

#) FAMILY INVOLVEMENT: 
The patients wife, and two daughters all visited the patient 
while on the ward, with such encounters noted to be very 
positive.

#INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Nadolol (started), Clonazepam (frequency 
changed);  Discontinued Remeron and ___
- Psychotherapeutic interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: attempted but names provided for 
psychiatry and cognitive neurology as the patient requested 
expeditious afternoon discharge

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I 
answered the patient's questions. The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
This patient does not abuse substances, is not 
suicidal/homicidal, is feeling well and is animated, euthymic, 
and participatory in the milieu, all of which indicate a low 
immediate risk of harm.

Despite history of assaultive behaviors, recent episodes of 
agitation, current risk of harm to self or others is low given 
improvement off SSRI and through modification of existing 
medications.

#) Chronic/Static Risk Factors:
- history of sexual abuse, prior suicide attempt, organic CNS 
damage, male sex, history of physical trauma, 
impulsive/aggressive tendencies

#) Modifiable Risk Factors:
- acute worsening of agitation, anxiety, limited outpatient 
support; We modified this risk by up-titrating the patient's 
clonazepam / starting the patient on nadolol.

#) Protective Factors:
- strong connections to family and community support, conflict 
resolution and handling problems in a non-violent way.  Current 
risk is low for intentional self-harm given that patient denies 
suicidal ideation, intent and plan, is accepting of treatment, 
is currently sober and is future oriented with plans to retire 
and enjoy his senior years.
