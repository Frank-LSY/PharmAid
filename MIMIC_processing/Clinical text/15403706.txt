Brief Hospital Course:
Brief hospital summary:
=========================
This is an ___ woman with a past medical history of 
severe gastritis, COPD, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus and 
recurrent hospitalizations for pneumonia and bronchitis, who 
presented to the hospital with acute onset of left-sided 
abdominal pain, chest pain, dyspnea. Of note she was seen at 
___ on ___ for right upper quadrant pain and was discharged 
with symptomatic antacid management and oxycodone. She was found 
to have an elevated d-dimer on admission however bilateral lower 
extremity Dopplers and a VQ scan were negative for DVT/PE. She 
was recommended to have an outpatient EGD to work-up because of 
her severe gastritis and potentially any occult malignancy being 
the cause of her elevated d-dimer. 

Transitional issues:
=======================
[ ] Please schedule an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with 
your primary doctor in ___
[ ] Incidental 6mm nodule seen in left lower lobe. Chest CT in 
___ months would be recommended for follow-up of the incidental 
left lower lobe nodule. 
[ ] Left ovarian cyst measuring up to 3.2 cm, for which clinical 
follow-up and repeat pelvic ultrasound in ___ year is recommended.

Acute/active issues:
=======================
#Elevated d-dimer
Found during work-up for now resolved chest pain and dyspnea. 
There was initially concern for DVT/PE so she was started on 
heparin gtt and she underwent lower extremity Dopplers which 
were negative for DVT. Given her severe contrast allergy, she 
underwent a VQ scan which demonstrate a low probability of PE. 
Her anticoagulation was stopped after this. Other considerations 
such as myocardial infarction, stroke, acute limb ischemia, DIC 
were all unlikely in this clinical picture. Atrial fibrillation 
was also considered as a cause of her elevated d-dimer, however 
she remained in sinus rhythm throughout her hospital stay. There 
is concern that her elevated d-dimer could be the result of an 
occult malignancy as well.

#Severe gastritis
Patient has long-standing history of gastritis. She notes that 
she eats multiple small meals throughout the day, and feels that 
her pain is actually improved upon eating. She reportedly had an 
EGD ___ years ago in ___ which was unremarkable. She 
continued on her home regimen of pantoprazole, ranitidine, 
sucralfate, simethicone.

#Chest pain
The initial concern was that she had an acute process such as 
MI, PE, pneumonia or pneumothorax contributing to her symptoms 
however these were ruled out. Though this chest pain was 
subjectively different from her usual dyspepsia pain it is most 
likely that dyspepsia was the cause of her symptoms.

Chronic/stable problems:
==========================
#COPD
Patient is on Brio Ellipta at home, and she was continued on the 
appropriate formulary alternative while in the hospital. She 
continued on montelukast.
#Diabetes, diet-controlled
She remained on a diabetic diet
#Hypothyroidism
Continued on Synthroid

Why was admitted to the hospital?

of chest pain shortness of breath and abdominal pain, and a 
blood test called a d-dimer was elevated.

What happened to me while I was in the hospital?
=================================================
You were initially started on a blood thinner because we were 
concerned that you had a clot in your legs or your lungs however 
you had a test called a VQ scan of the lungs which did not show 
any one clots, and he also had ultrasounds of the legs which did 
not show any clots so the blood thinner was stopped.  We 
considered doing an upper endoscopy to potentially evaluate the 
cause of your abdominal pain and elevated d-dimer however we 
decided that it was okay for you to follow-up with your doctors 
in ___ to have this test done.

What should I do when I leave the hospital?
============================================
Please continue to take all your medications as prescribed
-Please follow-up with your doctor in ___ to discuss 
setting up an EGD (upper endoscopy) as an outpatient.
