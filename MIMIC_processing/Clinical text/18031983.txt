History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ patient of
Dr. ___ for consultation regarding left foot pain. 
It has been going on for quite some time.  She recently saw her
primary care doctor.  She describes the left foot being cool and
painful, usually starts about 4:30 at night and runs across the
top of her foot.  She never gets any calf pain when she walks,
although she does not go very far.  She stands for work and
really can only go up and down the aisle once without stopping. 
She also feels that her foot is stiff.  She has never had any
ulceration or sores on the foot.  Her right leg does not bother
her, although she does not walk very far.  Unfortunately, she is
still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day and I may smell some
alcohol on her breath and I noted from the report that she has 
at
least three drinks a day.  It sounds like that may be more.  In
addition, unfortunately she does not take her aspirin even 
though
that was prescribed and it sounds like she periodically takes 
her
statin.  She also has known moderate carotid disease at 50%.

Further medical and surgical history, review of systems,
medications, see attached health questionnaire, which we 
reviewed
initially.  In addition, she underwent OMR review and medication
reconciliation.
