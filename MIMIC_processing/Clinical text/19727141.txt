___ CT Right Lower Extremity: Comminuted, minimally 
displaced, intra-articular tibial plateau fracture as described 
above. 
  
Large lipohemarthrosis. 
  
Surrounding small amount of soft hemorrhage. 
  
Vascular structures are not well evaluated on noncontrast 
enhanced exam.  
Clinical correlation for signs of vascular compromise is 
recommended. 

___ Xray Right knee: There is an acute minimally displaced 
fracture through the proximal right tibia.  There is involvement 
of the medial and lateral tibial plateau with extension to the 
medial and lateral articular surfaces.  An oblique fracture line 
is seen extending to the medial proximal right tibial 
metaphysis.  No additional fractures identified.  Distally, the 
tibia is intact.  No fibular fracture.  Moderate plantar 
calcaneal spur.  Right knee lipohemarthrosis is partially 
visualized.

___ CT Torso: 1. Several nondisplaced right-sided rib 
fractures, including the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and 
seventh ribs.  No evidence of further fracture, pneumothorax, or 
traumatic intra-abdominal injury. 
2. Severe emphysematous changes, including right apical scarring 
and numerous prominent bullae as described above.  If no prior 
studies are available to document stability, then follow-up 
imaging is recommended for the nodular components of scarring in 
___ months. 
3. Multiple mildly prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes, 
measuring 
approximately 1.0 cm. If no prior studies are available to 
document stability, then follow-up can be concurrently assessed 
in ___ months as above. 
4. Innumerable focal hypodensities noted throughout the spleen.  
For further characterization, MRI should be considered on a 
nonemergent basis. 
 
___ CT Head: 1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, 
fracture, or infarction. 2. Mild paranasal sinus disease, as 
described above. 

___ CT Spine: 1. No evidence of acute fracture or traumatic 
malalignment of the cervical spine. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented to ___ Department after a motor 
vehicle collision. Pt was evaluated by the trauma team, and he 
was found to have Right sided ___ nondisplaced rib fracture, 
and a right tibial plateau fracture. Given findings, the patient 
was admitted to the acute care surgery service. Orthopedic 
surgery was consulted and recommended no surgical intervention. 
A knee brace was placed on the patient's knee per Ortho's 
recommendation. 
 
Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with IV morphine and 
then transitioned to oral oxycodone once tolerating a diet. 
 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. The primary 
team contacted patient's primary care physician, who indicated 
that patient is no longer on xarelto and should not be taking 
it. Xarelto was not given to the patient during the 
hospitalization. 

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 

GI/GU/FEN: The diet was advanced sequentially to a Regular diet, 
which was well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were 
closely monitored

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of active bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin (TID 
given remote h/o of DVT and PE) and ___ dyne boots were used 
during this stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as 
early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ due to 
a motor vehicle collision. You have sustained rib fractures and 
a leg bone fracture right below your right knee. You are 
recovering well and are now ready for discharge. Please follow 
the instructions below to continue your recovery:

Rib Fractures:

* Your injury caused five right rib fractures (Ribs ___ which 
can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow 
breaths because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

Leg Bone Fracture: 

* Your injury caused a fracture in your right lower leg right 
below the knee. Your were seen by orthopedic surgery, and they 
have recommended knee-immobilizer. 

* You will have follow up with ___, NP in the
Orthopaedic Trauma Clinic 14 days post-operation for evaluation.
Call ___ to schedule appointment upon discharge.
Please follow up with your primary care doctor regarding this
admission within ___ weeks and for and any new
medications/refills.

* Please wear knee brace at all times as instructed by 
occupational and physical therapists. Touch down weight bearing 
in an unlocked, hinged, knee brace at all times.

* You may weight-bear on your right leg as tolerated. 

* For pain management, same as rib fractures above. 

Please follow up with your primary care physician next week and 
inform him of the following: On CT scan, severe emphysematous 
changes, including right apical scarring and numerous prominent 
bullae are noted. Multiple mildly prominent right paratracheal 
lymph nodes, measuring approximately 1.0 cm are also noted. 
Follow-up imaging is recommended for the nodular components of 
scarring and the lymph nodes in ___ months. Innumerable focal 
hypodensities noted throughout the spleen; MRI should be 
considered on a nonemergent basis.
