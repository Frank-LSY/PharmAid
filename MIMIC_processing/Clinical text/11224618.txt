IMAGING STUDIES

CTA Head/Neck ___
1. No acute hemorrhage. 
2. An area of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter of the 
left insula is nonspecific but may reflect a small vessel 
infarct of uncertain chronicity. 
3. Nondiagnostic CTA of the head and neck, as the contrast is 
concentrated in the venous rather than the arterial system, with 
apparent reflux of contrast into the neck veins from the left 
brachiocephalic vein.  This raises the question of tricuspid 
regurgitation. 
4. Cardiomegaly and coronary artery disease. 
5. Possible emphysema in the included upper lungs, not well 
evaluated. 

CTA Head/Neck ___
1. Re-demonstration of hypodensity in the subcortical white 
matter of the left insular cortex of uncertain chronicity and 
may reflect small vessel ischemic disease.  No new infarct.  No 
evidence of hemorrhage. 
2. No evidence of occlusion, stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm 
formation of the circle ___ and their principal branches.  No 
significant stenosis or occlusion of the carotid and vertebral 
arteries. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. No atrial septal defect 
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and regional/global 
systolic function (3D LVEF = 66%). No masses or thrombi are seen 
in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No PFO, ASD, or cardiac source of embolism seen. 
Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional biventricular 
systolic function.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with history of HTN, HLD and anxiety who 
presented following a syncopal episode while at the ___ 
game. He was evaluated in the ED where ___ demonstrated a 
small left insular hypodensity of unclear etiology. It is 
uncertain whether the patient's presenting complaint of syncope 
and previous episode of dizziness with tinnitus was related to 
the insular stroke. More likely, his syncopal episode was likely 
vasovagal given the clinical history (preceding diaphoresis, 
feeling warm, poor PO intake prior to the event), and 
hypovolemia likely exacerbated by alcohol use (positive alcohol 
Utox on admission) and poor oral intake. The previous episode of 
dizziness may have been related to vestibular neuritis. 

During hospitalization, CTA was benign. Repeat noncontrast head 
CT again demonstrated small left insular hypodensity. Extensive 
discussion was held with patient regarding importance of 
obtaining MRI to confirm whether he had stroke, mass or other 
process, as well as to determine chronicity. Unfortunately, 
patient was too claustrophobic to tolerate MRI at ___ and was 
ordered for MRI to be done in open scanner. He reported there 
was no way that he would tolerate a non-open MRI unless he was 
sedated to the point of requiring intubation.  

Stroke risk factors included triglycerides 151, LDL 63, TSH 
0.82, Hemoglobin A1c 5.6.  He was placed on aspirin 81mg daily. 
Did not require changes to his statin given LDL<70.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
   You were hospitalized at ___ following an event of loss of 
consciousness at ___.  You were evaluated at ___ where an 
incidental (unexpected) of a spot on your Brain CT Scan.  It was 
unclear what this spot represented and further evaluation is 
needed.  You do not appear to have any symptoms from this 
finding and it does not seem related to your recent symptoms.
   Due to your claustrophobia, you were unable to get an MRI in 
the hospital.  You were arranged to have an outpatient MRI scan 
and neurology follow-up.  It is important that you get this done 
to ensure no further work-up or treatment is needed.
   It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your ___ Care team
