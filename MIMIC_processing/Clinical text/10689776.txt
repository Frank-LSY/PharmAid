Brief Hospital Course:
================
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman with no known medical history 
with the exception of migraines and vertigo, who presented to an 
outside hospital after acute onset of left face, arm, and leg 
weakness on ___. CTA revealed a dense MCA sign in the right M1 
segment. She was given tPA at 2:20 on ___ and transferred to 
___, where she underwent thrombectomy with TICI III 
reperfusion. NIHSS on arrival to ___ was 11 (for facial 
weakness, left arm and leg weakness, gaze deviation, and 
neglect). After thrombolysis, she was admitted to the NeuroICU 
for close monitoring. NIHSS on arrival to the ICU was 1 (for 
facial weakness). Although she had been started on Levophed en 
route to ___, this was weaned prior to arrival in the ICU. She 
remained stable in the ICU and was transferred to the stroke 
service for further management.

=====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES:
=====================
#Ischemic stroke:
MRI post-thrombectomy demonstrated a right basal ganglia and 
periventricular lenticulostriate infarct with a small amount of 
hemorrhagic conversion. Exam was only notable for left facial 
numbness, mild left facial weakness, and very subtle left-sided 
weakness in an UMN pattern.

Stroke work-up included lower extremity Doppler ultrasound 
(negative for DVT bilaterally), echocardiogram which was 
negative for an ASD or PFO, with no intra-cardiac source of 
thromboembolism identified, lipid panel (cholesterol 208, HLD 
57, LDL 128), hgbA1c (5.1%), B2 glycoprotein negative and 
anti-cardiolipin antibodies negative, lupus anti-coagulant 
pending, D-dimer was normal at 306. She was monitored on 
telemetry with no evidence of atrial fibrillation; she was 
discharged home with aspirin 81mg and atorvastatin. Overall, the 
etiology of her stroke was felt to be embolic in nature, 
although etiology is still unclear given her otherwise benign 
medical history. Ms. ___ could have undetected atrial 
fibrillation, or an underlying hypercoagulability. Her d-dimer 
is normal, making an occult malignancy less likely. Patient does 
have a known diagnosis of migraine and has been on an 
estrogen-containing OCP. Moreover, her stroke could have been 
related to the aneurysms in her left MCA. A paradoxical embolism 
from a DVT is unlikely given no findings on TTE. She endorsed a 
history of snoring which could also represent undiagnosed atrial 
fibrillation.

For treatment, her oral contraceptive was stopped. She was 
started on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg. Her home 
propranolol was also restarted.

She was evaluated by the physical therapy and occupational 
therapy, who recommended acute rehab. She was discharged home to 
___ where she was recommended to attend an ___ 
rehabilitation program.

#Right ICA Aneurysm: 
Imaging was also notable for a multiple aneurysms, including a 
large right ICA aneurysm, for which neurosurgery was consulted 
regarding long-term management. They recommended follow-up at a 
neurosurgery center closer to her home once her acute ischemic 
stroke was stabilized. She is being sent home with a disk of her 
radiological images. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

[ ] Please refer patient to Vascular Neurosurgery/Neurology for 
treatment of her large carotid aneurysm. Our Neurosurgery team 
recommended ___ Clinic group; if patient is interested in 
traveling there, we recommend an opinion from Dr. ___, 
an excellent stroke neurologist. She was provided a copy of a 
disc with all relevant imaging upon discharge.

[ ] Consider the following next steps to evaluate etiology of 
her stroke:

- cardiac monitoring for ___ weeks to look for occult arrhythmia

- consider a transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate for 
possible PFO that was not seen on the transthoracic 
echocardiogram

- referral for sleep study to evaluate for possible obstructive 
sleep apnea

- consider further lab testing for hypercoagulability such as: 
factor V leiden, antithrombin and prothrombin gene mutations, 
protein C and S deficiencies (unfortunately these tests are 
unable to be sent inpatient)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

___ were hospitalized due to symptoms of left-sided weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms. Fortunately, ___ presented to the 
hospital very quickly after the onset of your symptoms, and ___ 
received therapy to break up the clot (tissue plasminogen 
activator), and ___ underwent a procedure to remove the clot 
(thrombectomy). This was successful, although ___ do have some 
on-going weakness and sensory deficits in your left face and 
weakness in your left arm and leg. We expect these symptoms to 
improve over time with physical and occupational therapy.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed ___ for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
This work-up included an echocardiogram to look at your heart 
which was normal. We also sent a panel of tests to look for 
reasons why ___ might be hypercoagulable (more likely to form 
clots than the average person), which was negative. 

In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are: use of an estrogen-containing 
oral contraceptive, history of migraine headaches, and 
hyperlipidemia.

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- We stopped your oral contraceptive, as estrogen-containing 
medications increase your risk of clotting. ___ can consider 
other options for your migraine management.
- We started ___ on atorvastatin for high cholesterol.
- We started ___ on aspirin 81mg to prevent further clotting.   

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below, as there may still be tests that can be done as 
an outpatient to assess the reason for your stroke.  

If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
___  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team
