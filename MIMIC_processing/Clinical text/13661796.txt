Brief Hospital Course:
Following diagnosis of his bilateral distal radius fractures, 
the patient was admitted to the ACS service for monitoring and 
cleared by the Cardiology service before going to the OR with 
the orthopedics team for a Left ORIF. He tolerated the procedure 
well and without complications; for further information 
regarding the operation, please refer to the operative note in 
the OMR. 

The patient was sent back to the ACS service where he remained 
for the duration of his stay. He was noticed to have some 
substantial nighttime desaturations into the low ___ on SpO2 
which was attributed to undiagnosed OSA. He was started on a 
CPAP and saw substantial improvements in his oxygen saturations. 
We consulted the medicine service during his stay to evaluate 
the possibility of a syncopal episode contributing to his MVC. 
They agreed that his episode of falling asleep at the wheel was 
most likely secondary to excessive sleepiness from his OSA 
rather than a syncopal event, although the patient did report 
prior episodes of syncope. 

The patient's discharge was begun. He was set up for an 
outpatient sleep study with the Sleep Disorder Clinic at ___ 
who was made aware of his visit. The patient was instructed that 
he is not allowed to drive until cleared by both his PCP 
regarding his OSA and sleepiness and his Orthopedic surgeon. His 
Sodium levels were noted to be mildly low on the day of his 
discharge and the patient was informed that he should get his 
blood checked in the next week or when he follows up with his 
PCP. By the time of his discharge, he was ambulating 
independently, voiding, having bowel function and his pain was 
controlled with pain medications by mouth.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service at the ___ 
___ for management of your traumatic 
injuries following a motor vehicle accident. You suffered 
bilateral fractures in your forearms for which you received a 
left sided internal fixation by the orthopedic surgery team. You 
have recovered well from this injury and are ready to return 
home to finish your recovery. 

Notably, you were found to have significant oxygen requirements 
at night and you are suspected to have significant obstructive 
sleep apnea, which can cause low oxygen levels, non-restorative 
sleep and excessive daytime somnolence; this likely contributed 
to you falling asleep at the wheel. We were unable to get an 
appointment for a sleep study for definitive diagnosis of your 
sleep apnea as an inpatient but please call the Sleep Disorder 
Clinic at ___ if you do now hear from them by 
___. They have been notified of your necessary 
appointment. 

With respect to your traumatic injuries, you are not to bear any 
weight with your upper extremities. You are also NOT ___ until you are cleared to do so by both your Orthopedic 
Surgeon AND the Sleep Specialists that you will see in follow 
up. You will see the Orthopedic team for an appointment in 2 
weeks. Please schedule the appointment as below.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
 
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the endoscopy.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of medicine such as 
Percocet or codeine. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
 
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.

***Finally, your Sodium levels were noticed to be mildly low 
before your discharge. This should equilibrate as you return to 
a regular diet but you should get your levels checked in the 
next week. The order has been placed for you here. If you cannot 
return to ___, your PCP may check your levels for you. 
Otherwise, you can get your labs drawn at the laboratory here at 
___.

Good Luck
