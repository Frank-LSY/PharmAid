Chief Complaint:
Continued back and leg pain following prior lumbar surgeries.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
REVISION FUSION L4-L5, RIGHT L5-L6 MICRODISCECTOMY; L4-L6 FUSION

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old male who has had multiple back fusions, with the 
latest being a T11-L4 done at an OSH. He has continued lower 
back and mid thoracic back pain, with L4 radiculopathy. A caudal 
injection was done without any therapeutic benefit.
A lumbar CT scan demonstrated good bony fusion in the upper 3 
level constructs, but poor fusion in the last two. He does not 
show, however, any screw loosening or halo anyway. In 
flexion/extension XR, he doesn't show any frank movement, 
neither in thoracic nor lumbar.

His pain was thought to be resulting from right sided disc 
herniation at the level below the construct due to ASD. Surgery 
was proposed in the form of an extension of the fusion to one 
level below (L4-5 revision and L4-6 fusion) and right L5-6 
microdiscectomy. We explained the procedure, recovery time and
complications.

asthma, GERD, depression and chronic low back pain s/p T11-L4 
fusion

in OMR for further surgical/intra-operative details. Patient was 
extubated in the OR and taken to the PACU in stable condition.
