Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
======================
This is a ___ year old woman with no known past medical history 
who presented to the ___ ED with inebriation and vomiting. In 
the ED, given continued emesis, she was intubated for airway 
protection and was transferred to the ICU for further 
management. Per patient history, drank a total of ___ alcoholic 
beverages over ___ hours. Denied other substance use at that 
time but is unsure if someone slipped something into her drink 
at the bar/after party she attended prior to admission. She did 
not have any overnight events in the ICU and was extubated 
without complication the following day. She was not started on 
any medications. She was encouraged to see her primary care 
physician to continue discussing how she can better manage her 
alcohol use. 

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE, secondary to 
# INABILITY TO PROTECT AIRWAY: patient intubated in ED, after 
observed to have low GCS and emesis, with concern for ability to 
protect airway. Was initially sedated with fentanyl & midazolam 
gtt in the ED. The following morning, Ms. ___ was weaned off 
the ventilator without complications and extubated on ___. 
She maintained SO2 on room air without incident.  

# ALCOHOL INTOXICATION: no other significant lab abnormalities. 
Serum etOH 193. Urine toxicology screen negative for other 
substances, and urine HCG negative. Intubated for airway 
protection in setting of low GCS secondary to severe etOH 
intoxication. Patient does not have a history of chronic alcohol 
use and is not at risk for while draw. Vomited twice after 
extubation but then resolved by afternoon and eating/drinking 
well. Patient was treated with thiamine 500 mg, folate, 
rehydrated with IVF. Discussed risk of binge drinking and 
protecting drinks from potential contamination with other drugs. 


# HEMATEMESIS: Patient had bloody output when NG tube first 
placed in the ED, then not blood output upon arrival to the 
FICU. Likely secondary to ___ tear in the setting of 
vomiting and instrucmentation. H/H remained stable, patient 
hemodyranmically stable without pain. Patient received 
Pantoprazole IV 40 mg BID while in house. After extubation, 
patient vomited twice, clear vomit without blood or bile.  

# HYPOTENSION: transient, to mid-80s, as noted in EMS report, as 
well as at triage in ___ ED. Improved quickly thereafter to 
110s. Upon arrival to ___, pressures improved to 112/65. Low 
suspicion for infection. Aspiration pneumonitis possible, given 
emesis and inebriation, though CXR unremarkable. Likely in the 
setting of EtOH and hypovolemia ___ vomiting.
