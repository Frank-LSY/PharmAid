History of Present Illness:
___ PMH diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy who presents with
___ pain and ___. 

He had been seen in the ED on ___ with a similar complaint of
___ pain. He had a CT scan which did not show any clear 
etiology,
but given history of diverticulitis he was given a prescription
for cipro and metronidazole which he has since completed.

He reports that he has been having ___ pain for about 2 weeks. 
He
has not noticed any clear exacerbating or alleviating factors.
Previously the pain had been intermittent, but it has been
constant over the past ___ days. Because of the pain he has not
eaten solid food in 2 weeks. He has been drinking 1.5 bottles of
gatorade per day. He vomited a few times but has mostly been

supplements or herbs.

On arrival to the ED his initial VS were 98.4 82 104/66 19 98%
RA. Basic labs were obtained and were notable for BUN/Cr 62/4.7
which is up from ___ when it was ___. Renal ultrasound and 
CT
scan were obtained and did not show obstruction, hydronephrosis.
There was minimal perinephric stranding which was read as "may
relate to deceased renal function". There were no findings to
correlate with ___ pain. Renal was consulted and stated in ED
dash ___ M w/ hx of diverticulitis and colectomy, who is in the
ED with abdominal pain and was found to have a Cr 6.2 and BUN 
57.
Apparently with decreased PO intake due to pain. Was in ED on
___ and had received IV contrast for a ___ could be due
to CIN." He was given 1L NS, dilaudid 0.5mg IV x2 and was then

IMAGING
=======
CT A/P ___. No renal, ureteral, or bladder calculus seen.  No 
hydronephrosis or 
hydroureter.  Minimal subtle symmetric bilateral perinephric 
stranding may 
relate to decreased renal function.  Otherwise, no acute CT 
findings seen.

Renal US ___
Normal renal ultrasound.  No hydronephrosis bilaterally. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy who presents with
___ pain and ___. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[] Would consider renal outpatient referral given degree ___ 
may be consistent with underlying CKD unknown etiology. Would 
also repeat Creatinine within one week following discharge
[] Patient had ongoing ___ pain with no findings on imaging. 
Would benefit from further workup
[] Would recommend colonoscopy referral outpatient 
[] Given ___ and normal BPs while inpatient, lisinopril and HCTZ 
were held on discharge, would consider restarting these once Cr 
has completely normalized if patient warrants it based on 
outpatient BPs

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
___:
He reported decreased PO intake over the past 2 weeks which 
could have caused a prerenal ___. He did not appear particularly 
volume overloaded on exam, but he was given IVFs in the ED so he 
may have looked more hypovolemic on initial presentation. His 
subtotal colectomy may also contribute to him being more 
susceptible to dehydration given decreased surface area for 
colonic re-absorption of fluid. CT scan did not show any 
evidence of obstruction so this is unlikely. Intrinsic causes of 
renal failure are also possible given that his FeNa was 1.6%. If 
this was all hypovolemia then would have expected his urine Na 
to be lower. He had not taken any new medications or herbal 
supplements. He did not use NSAIDs, but the combination of an 
ACE-I and prolonged hypovolemia could have caused ___ 
progressing to ATN. He had significant improvement in Creatinine 
overnight following IVF and typical pre-renal BUN to Creatinine 
ratio. He received 1 more L IVF and Creatinine went down to 1.3 
(baseline appears to be around 1.2). We held his lisinopril and 
HCTZ.

___ pain:
The cause of his ___ pain is unclear. He was prescribed 
cipro/flagyl by a provider at ___ ___ but he is unsure why and 
we do not have access, but presumably given his history this was 
given for a presumed diagnosis of diverticulitis causing his ___
pain. It is possible that he did have diverticulitis and it had 
improved with the antibiotics prior to his ED presentation on 
___ so that it did not appear on imaging. Another possibility 
is adhesions from his prior subtotal colectomy causing 
intermittent obstruction, though he is currently having BMs. 
Reassuringly, his
pain improved on arrival to the floor, his appetite had 
returned, and the CT scan showed no concerning etiology for the 
pain. He was tolerating POs without issues.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#HTN:
HCTZ and lisinopril were held in the setting of ___. He was 
continued on clonidine.

#Depression/anxiety:
He was continued on home fluoxetine and hydroxyzine

#GERD: 
He was continued on home omeprazole
