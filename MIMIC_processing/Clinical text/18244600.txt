Brief Hospital Course:
================================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES  
================================================
- patient started on insulin (lantus 10u at night upon 
discharge) this admission; will require immediate ___ 
follow-up (contacted to set up follow-up within ___ days)
- recommend ohptho and podiatry f/u, would likely benefit from 
___ assistance for BG monitoring 
- recommend GI referral for colonoscopy and outpatient 
evaluation of chronic diarrhea

================================================
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
================================================
___ with DM, brought in by his daughter for 6 months of 
diarrhea, found to be hyperglycemic with A1C of 17.2, concerning 
for autoimmune diabetes vs medication non-compliance, as well as 
diarrhea of infectious source. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Diabetes Mellitus 
On arrival A1C 17.2, BG 694 trended down to high 100s-200s with 
insulin. Home med of metformin 500 BID with questionable 
compliance. Patient is very thin and has been reporting ongoing 
weight loss, which may be explained by chronic diarrhea and 
malabsorption, but concern remains about possible latent type I 
DM as opposed to gravely uncontrolled type II. Autoimmune DM 
labs pending by discharge. ___ initiated lantus and insulin 
administration instruction, increased metformin and glipizide. 
- patient started on insulin (lantus at night) this admission; 
will require immediate ___ follow-up (contacted to set up 
follow-up within ___ days)
- recommend ohptho and podiatry f/u, would likely benefit from 
___ assistance for BG monitoring 

# Chronic Diarrhea
Patient has a hx of 6 months of 7 water stools/day, no clear 
correlation with food but concern for malabsorption iso weight 
loss. Differential thus remains broad (lactose intolerance, 
pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, IBD). Should consider 
microscopic colitis in older patient with many water stools, and 
association with type I DM. Chronic infxns should be considered 
(microsporidium if immunocompromised, giardia). Hep A/B/C 
serologies negative, stool cultures negative with pending O&P by 
discharge, HIV negative, C Diff negative. Celiac serologies 
pending. Provided Metamucil on discharge.
- recommend GI referral for colonoscopy and outpatient 
evaluation of chronic diarrhea.  His diarrhea improved 
significantly in hospital without intervention, suggesting a 
dietary component to his symptoms.

# Transaminits 
Consistent with hepatocellular pattern, we have no previous lab 
data for comparison. No meds that would lead to hepatotoxity, 
viral infxn including hepatitis should be considered, not 
alcoholic pattern and he denies any significant EtOH use. RUQ US 
without architectural abnormality, HAV/HBV/HCV negative. 
Improving without intervention.

# Normocytic Anemia
Mild anemia of 12.4 on admission. Patient has never been told he 
had anemia, never had screening colonoscopy, no concerns for 
active bleeding on presentation, should consider vitamin 
deficiencies iso possible malabsorption as above. Iron studies, 
VitB12, folate within normal limits. Potentially related to 
gastrointestinal inflammation or malabsorption above.
