CC: food impaction

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ upper endoscopy with removal of impacted food
 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a ___ male w/no significant PMHx who
presented with food impaction.  He was in his usual state of
health until around 5 ___ while eating steak he felt food become
stuck in his throat.  He had difficulty tolerating his
secretions, although he denied chest pain or shortness of 
breath.
He initially had some difficulty speaking which have been
improved by the time he arrived to the emergency department on
___.  He was seen at twice daily ___, lateral and neck x-ray
and chest x-ray were performed and were unremarkable.  A trial 
of
glucagon did not result in any improvement, and he was unable to
tolerate sips of water.  As a result he was transferred to the
___ emergency department.  Nothing like this has happened to
him before.

In the ED: Vitals were unremarkable, he was seen and found to be
"drooling, spitting up secretions."  Gastroenterology was
consulted, and he was transferred to the endoscopy suite where a
disimpaction via upper endoscopy was performed.  Postprocedure 
he
had a significant oxygen requirement, and so is admitted for
monitoring, and weaning of oxygen.

Seen on the floor, he is doing well, and feels well.  He denies
shortness of breath or cough, fevers or chills.  He confirms he
is not on oxygen at home.  He does endorse a significant smoking
history, he quit ___ years ago, however prior to that he smoked

care.  He has no questions for me.

Imaging
___ CXR
IMPRESSION: There are no prior chest radiographs available for 
review.  Heart size normal.  Lungs clear.  No pleural 
abnormality.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.

Procedures
___ EGD
Impression: A large amount of solid food consistent with steak
was found in esophageal lumen. This was removed using ___ net
and rat tooth forceps. A large bolus of food could ultimately be
pushed down into the stomach. (foreign body removal)
Esophageal ring
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
Recommendations: - Wean oxygen as able 
- Omeprazole 20 mg BID (30 minutes breakfast) till next 
endoscopy
- Repeat EGD for possible dilation in 14 days in ___
- Liquid diet for 24 hours and soft solid after that 

Discharge Labs
Same as admission -- no others were checked

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with no significant past medical history now 
presenting with esophageal food impaction, likely related to 
esophageal ring, status post upper endoscopy with disimpaction, 
with ongoing oxygen requirement suspected due to atelectasis.

The day of discharge, he ate tuna fish and other soft foods 
without difficulty.  He was seen by Nutrition who instructed him 
on a soft diet and gave him handouts.  He has their clinic phone 
number for any questions.

#Persistent O2 requirement after upper endoscopy
-Suspected due to atelectasis based on chest imaging, although 
given his significant smoking history it is possible that there 
is a component of obstructive lung disease
-Given the lack of wheezing on exam, we treated this with 
incentive spirometry, and ambulation, and were able to wean his 
oxygen easily

#Esophageal food impaction, associated with esophageal ring
-Per gastroenterology recommendations, we will have him on 
omeprazole 20 mg p.o. twice daily, and a soft diet as noted 
above, and he will ___ with them in 2 weeks for a dilation

#Benign prostatic hypertrophy
-Continue home finasteride and tamsulosin

#Advance care planning
- Health Care Proxy: as per ___, he identifies his wife
- Care ___: He has thought about the kind of care he 
would want if he were to get very sick some day.  He does say "I 
do not want to be dead, but I do not want to be in any pain or 
discomfort.  I would rather go ___ years early if that is what it
meant."  He states he has talked with his wife about his wishes.

The patient was safe to discharge and on the day of discharge I 
spent >30min in discharge day services and coordination of care.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after suffering a food impaction in your 
esophagus.  This was likely due to an "esophageal ring" which is 
a narrowing in the esophagus.  You had an endoscopy and the food 
was removed.  After the procedure you tolerated a soft diet 
without difficulty.  You should continue this diet, and the acid 
reducing pill (omeprazole) at least until you are seen by 
Gastroenterology in two weeks as noted below.
