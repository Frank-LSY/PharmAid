IMAGING: 
 
CTA Head and Neck: 
1. No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute 
infarction. 
2. Unremarkable head and neck CTA.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM
1. Normal study. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. No definite 
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.

CT HEAD s/p 24 hours TPA: 
1. Chronic right putaminal and external capsule lacune with no 
evidence of 
hemorrhage or new infarction. 

MRI head without Contrast:
1. Probable chronic lacune involving the lateral portion of the 
right 
putaminal and the adjacent external capsule.  Otherwise normal 
study. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ man who was admitted s/p tPA given 
at an outside hospital for right facial droop and dysarthria. 

Neurologic Work-up: 
The patient was admitted to the stroke team for further 
evaluation. 
The patient did not have further neurologic sequelae or develop 
new symptoms after the tPA treatment. 
24 hour imaging revealed chronic infarct with no hemorrhage , or 
acute ischemia seen. Likely, the patient was suffering from a 
TIA vs. the patient had a soft clot that was dissolved by the 
tPA. 
The patient also had an ECHO which did not reveal any structural 
causes for cardiac embolus. 
Patient worked with ___ and was able to complete all of the 
trainings and tasks, and was cleared to return home. 
Patient tolerated aspirin 81mg but did not wish to take 
atorvastatin based on his worries of sexual side effects. He 
will continue to take his home dose of pravastatin. 

Of note, the patient's TSH returned elevated to 7.0. Free T4 was 
pending. 
The patient can follow-up with his primary care physician for 
further evaluation. 

The patient had resolution of his neurologic symptoms with 
slight left facial nasolabial fold flattening as the only 
visible deficit. The patient has a neurology stroke follow-up in 
3 months for further assessment.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of facial droop and 
slurred speech resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
High Blood Pressure
High Cholesterol 
  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
1. Aspirin 81 mg daily
2. Atorvastatin 80mg daily 
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
