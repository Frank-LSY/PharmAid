EUS ___
Impression: 
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz
frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. 
Bile duct: The bile duct was imaged at the level of the
porta-hepatis, head of the pancreas and ampulla. The CBD was
dilated at a maximum diameter of 10 mm. Multiple hyperechoic 
foci
consistent with sludge were noted in the CBD. A hyperechoic 
focus
with anechoic shadow consistent with a stone was seen in the
lower CBD.
 
ERCP ___
Impression: The scout film showed surgical clips in the RUQ. 
The major papilla was bulging. 
The CBD was successfully cannulated using a Rx sphincterotome
preloaded with 0.035in guidewire. 
Contrast injection revealed small filling defects in the lower
CBD consistent with sludge. The CBD was dilated up to
approximately 10mm in diameter. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed at the 12
o'clock position. There was mild post-sphincterotomy oozing. 
Large amounts of dark thick bile was draining from the major
papilla after sphincterotomy. 
The bile duct was swept multiple times using a biliary balloon
catheter. Moderate amount of sludge material was successfully
removed. 
Occlusion cholangiogram revealed no more filling defects. There
was excellent contrast and bile drainage at the end of the
procedure. 
It was noted that the post-sphincterotomy oozing has stopped by
the end of the procedure. 

ERCP ___
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted at the major 
papilla.
 There was no blood seen in the lumen of the duodenum. 
There was a red spot noted at the base of the papilla which was 
cauterized by gold probe. 
There was mild redness seen at the apex and was cauterized.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

concerning
for a GIB. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient with a recent ERCP and
sphincterotomy, with 2 episodes of melena, and a downtrending 
H&H
of pre procedure hemoglobin 13.6 to 7.2. This was concerning for 
a possible post sphincterotomy bleed. Patient was initially 
started on an IV PPI. She underwent ERCP with cautery on ___. 
Following the procedure her HB stabilized between ___. She was 
still having relative hypotension that was fluid responsive. On 
day of discharge, patient with negative orthostatics and felt 
well ambulating. Patient was not discharged with a PPI given the 
etiology of her bleed. 

# Syncope: Patient presenting with a single episode of syncope,
occurring following acute blood loss, likely reflecting
hypovolemia. No other concerning symptoms such as chest pain,
shortness of breath. EKG unremarkable. No episodes of syncope, 
lightheadedness while hospitalized. 
- orthostatics negative on ___ and ___
- BP checks at home

# Transaminitis: Admission LFTs notable for ALT 147 AST 51,
downtrending from prior following ERCP with sphincterotomy. No
persistent abdominal pain. LFTs downtrended while hospitalized. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Repeat CBC for hemoglobin in ___ weeks with PCP
-___ LFTs in ___ weeks with PCP 
-___ give patient prescription for a blood pressure cuff but 
should have her blood pressure checked early this week at a
