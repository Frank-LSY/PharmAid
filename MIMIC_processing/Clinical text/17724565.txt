History of Present Illness:
PCP: ___ - ___

___ patient seen and examined today: 2330

CC: abdominal pain

HPI(4): 
Ms. ___ is a ___ female past medical history
significant for renal cyst, cholelithiasis, multiple sclerosis
presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain.

Patient states that around 5 days ago started to feel unwell.
Alternating between hot and cold. Then developed cramps in her
lower stomach with diarrhea all night - watery and yellow. The
following days she didn't feel particularly well, but no further
events. Then on ___ late afternoon had sudden onset severe
abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and radiating to
epigastric area. This was following a fatty meal. The pain
gradually receded, but then returned the day prior to admission.
Therefore the patient presented to the hospital.

Patient notes that she has had similar prior episodes. She has
been seen at ___, and had spoken with the surgeon,
but he was not comfortable with removing her gallbladder given
her prior history of abdominal surgeries. She notes that she has
had several prior MRIs and ultrasounds, as well as "scopes". She
also recalls eating radioactive scrambled eggs, though thinks
that may be for delayed gastric emptying. She also had a test
where they were watching her gallbladder while injecting dye. 
She
also notes that she has been told she has had fatty liver in the
past, and that one of her MS medications can cause some liver
dysfunction. 

She also notes that she has a kidney cyst that is being followed
with ultrasounds and MRIs.

IMAGING:
========
MRCP (___):
Lower Thorax: Visualized lung bases are clear on limited
assessment. 
Liver: Mild loss of signal on out of phase imaging, compatible
with hepatic steatosis.  No suspicious hepatic lesion. 
Biliary: No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The CBD
measures up to 7 mm (series 3, image 17), within normal limits
given the patient's age.  The gallbladder is mildly distended 
and
contains multiple large stones without wall thickening or
pericholecystic fluid. 
Pancreas: The main pancreatic duct is prominent, but within
normal limits. Pancreatic parenchyma is normal in signal
intensity. 
Spleen: Spleen is normal in size and signal intensity. 
Adrenal Glands: Adrenal glands are unremarkable. 
Kidneys: Bilateral T2 hyperintense renal lesions, compatible 
with
simple cysts.  No suspicious renal mass.  No hydronephrosis. 
Gastrointestinal Tract:  There is a small hiatal hernia.  
Stomach
is otherwise within normal limits.  There is a prominent 
duodenal
diverticulum (series 5, image 25) at the second portion of the
duodenum.  Otherwise, visualized small and large bowel loops are
nondistended and without mural thickening. 
Lymph Nodes: No lymphadenopathy. 
Vasculature: Aorta and its major branches are patent.  No
abdominal aortic aneurysm 
Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: No suspicious osseous 
lesion.
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Hepatic steatosis. 
2.  Uncomplicated cholelithiasis. 

EKG (___):
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 93, PR 154, QTc 451, no ST
depressions or elevations. T wave flattening in III. 

CXR (___):
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

RUQ U/S (___):
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of
liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or
cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. 
2. Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis.  No specific
sonographic findings to indicate acute cholecystitis, although
this cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  If
there is persistent clinical concern, HIDA scan may be obtained
for further evaluation.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx MS, cholelithiasis (with reportedly negative HIDA 
scans previously), perforated duodenal diverticulum s/p ex lap x 
2 (___), ischemic colitis, hypothyroidism, renal cyst 
presenting with abdominal pain, elevated LFTs, and 
cholelithiasis, c/f passed gallstone.

# Abdominal pain:
# Transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia:
# Cholelithiasis:
# Hepatic steatosis:
# Hx perforated duodenal diverticulum:
# Hx ischemic colitis:
P/w ___ days of colicky epigastric abdominal pain and loose 
stools without emesis. Found to have mild transaminitis with 
hyperbilirubinemia (although predominantly indirect, Tbili 2.4, 
Dbili 0.5). RUQ U/S with gallstones but no clear cholecystitis. 
MRCP showed cholelithiasis without clear biliary dilation or 
cholecystitis, as well hepatic steatosis. She was treated with 
bowel rest with complete resolution of her abdominal pain and 
mild diarrhea and resolution of her LFT abnormalities by HD #3. 
She was tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge. 
Suspect that her presentation is likely attributable to 
symptomatic cholelithiasis with a possible passed gallstone 
(although predominantly indirect bilirubin is somewhat less 
consistent). No e/o cholecystitis, cholangitis, obstruction, or 
perforation. Ddx includes a mild viral gastroenteritis (although 
absence of emesis atypical), less likely recurrent ischemic 
colitis (given nl lactate) or medication effect (home Tecfidera 
can cause abdominal pain and mild transaminitis). Low suspicion 
for gastric ulcer, but home diclofenac held on discharge. She 
was evaluated by surgery, who felt that CCY was too high-risk 
given hx of intra-abdominal surgeries and adhesions. She will 
___ with her PCP's office (Dr. ___ at ___ on 
___. Would repeat LFTs at that time to ensure continued 
stability and would recommend referral to GI for further 
evaluation/management of hepatic steatosis and to surgery for 
ongoing discussions of CCY.

# Leukopenia:
# Microcytic anemia:
CBC WNL on admission but WBC 3.9 and Hgb 11.1 at the time of 
discharge. Suspect dilutional in setting of IVFs. No e/o 
infection or bleeding. Would repeat CBC at PCP ___ on ___.

# Asymptomatic bacteriuria:
UCx growing E.coli, but UA without pyuria. Likely asymptomatic 
bacteriuria, not treated with antibiotics.

# Multiple sclerosis:
Stable. Patient opted to hold home tecfidera while in hospital 
but will resume on discharge. Home baclofen, gabapentin, and 
dextroamphetamine continued. Home diclofenac held on discharge 
given presenting abdominal pain as above; would recommend 
avoiding NSAIDs if possible going forward.

# Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine 

# GERD: continued home omeprazole 20mg daily 

# Renal cysts:
Stable on MCRP. Follow-up with outpatient providers.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, likely 
due to a passed gallstone. You were treated with bowel rest and 
fluids, and your pain resolved on its own. You were seen by the 
surgery service, who unfortunately feel as though resection of 
your gallbladder is too high risk to pursue electively.

Please follow-up with your primary care provider as below, as 
well as with your outpatient gastroenterologist (given some 
evidence of a fatty liver on MRI). I would recommend 
discontinuing your home diclofenac for now, which can put you at 
risk for stomach ulcers.

With best wishes,
___ Medicine
