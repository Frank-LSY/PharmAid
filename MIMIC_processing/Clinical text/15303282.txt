Colonoscopy ___:
Lesions A 35mm polyp was noted in the cecum just behind the 
ileocecal valve. Complete visualization was difficult as the 
polyp was buried behind the valve. The polyp was raised by 
submucosal injection with saline and methylene blue to create a 
saline pillow which helped better visualize the polyp. An 
endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was then performed and the 
polyp was completely removed in piecemeal fashion using a hot 
snare. The borders of the polypectomy site were then cauterized 
using argon plasma coagulation (APC). 5cc epinephrine was then 
injected around the polypectomy site. No bleeding was noted at 
the end of the procedure. The polyp fragments were removed via 
___ net.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with UC well controlled on Lialda presenting with 5 day 
history of BRBPR in setting of colonoscopy with endoscopic 
mucosal resection of adenoma on ___.

A large non-bleeding ulcer and a non-bleeding visible vessel
