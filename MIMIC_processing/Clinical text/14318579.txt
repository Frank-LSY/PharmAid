Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=============
___ M with HTN, HLD, DVT's on warfarin presenting with 4 days of 
intermittent substernal pressure after meals found to have 
NSTEMI with troponin leak to 0.03. He initially underwent stress 
echo which was non-diagnostic. He subsequently underwent PMIBI 
which demonstrated a reversible defect, however coronary 
angiography did not demonstrate any significant coronary 
disease. LLE ultrasound demonstrated chronic DVT and he was 
discharged on a bridge of lovenox to warfarin. 

TRANSTIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[] recommend INR check on ___
[] consider reevaluation of left lower extremity with repeat 
ultrasound or referral to hematology for work up of chronic 
thrombus despite anticoagulation 
[] started atorvastatin for primary prevention 

=============== 
ACTIVE ISSUES: 
=============== 
#NSTEMI
He presented with chest pressure after meals over the last 4 
days that raised concern for cardiac ischemia in the setting of 
multiple risk factors including HLD, family history, and 
self-reported history of "poor leg function" likely consistent 
with PAD. He initially presented to ___ where EKG was 
without ischemic changes, but was noted to have a mild troponin 
leak to 0.01. He received an aspirin load and was subsequently 
transferred to ___ where troponins were noted to uptrend, with 
peak at 0.03. He initially underwent stress TTE which was 
non-diagnostic due to poor exercise performance. He subsequently 
underwent P-MIBI which demonstrated a reversible defect, however 
cardiac cath was without significant coronary disease. His home 
lisinopril 10mg was continued. His home simvastatin was 
converted to high dose atorvastatin. 

#HISTORY OF L. POPLITEAL ANKLE DVT:
#SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR:
INR was supratherapeutic to 3.8 on presentation. Warfarin was 
initially held in the setting supratherapeutic INR and in case 
of potential cath. A lower extremity ultrasound showed chronic 
DVT in the left popliteal vein. Given this, he was discharged on 
a lovenox bridge to therapeutic warfarin. 

================ 
CHRONIC ISSUES: 
================ 

#COLITIS:
S/p C-scope at ___ in ___. Currently on apriso formulation 
of mesalamine. He was converted to equivalent dose of pentasa, 
500mg TID while in house. 

#HLD: 
Transitioned from home simvastatin to atorvastatin 40mg as 
above. 

#PERIPHERAL NEUROPATH: 
Unclear etiology. A1c 5.3. Continued home gabapentin.
