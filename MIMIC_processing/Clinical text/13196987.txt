PSYCHIATRIC
#)On admission, pt present with worsening depressive symptoms, 
social withdrawal, and SI with plan to jump off the fire scape. 
During hospitalization, we started him on Wellbutrin SR 100mg 
qam. That medication was chosen based on pt's hx of poor 
response to SSRI, pt's predominant depressive sx's with poor 
motivation, decreased attention and based on pt's family hx of 
good response to Wellbutrin.
Given pt has improved mood, energy, and concentration, we 
changed to Wellbutrin XL 150mg qAM.
In context of unimpressive response to the Risperdal, we 
discontinued his home dose Risperdal 0.75mg daily, and started 
him with Abilify 5mg qhs. Pt tolerated the medication regimen 
well, with no noted side effects. He was also given PRN 
trazodone 25mg qhs to help with sleep.

On discharge, his mood is less depressed and less flat. He feels 
more motivated and energetic to socialize and doing his hobbies. 
The patient no longer endorses thoughts of self-harm and has 
gained greater insight into his illness over the course of 
hishospitalization. The patient has been able to contract for 
safety and has expressed that should any suicidal or homicidal 
thoughts return, he would notify staff immediately. The patient 
has also expressed that he is invested in his treatment and 
looks forward to continue follow up with his outpatient 
psychiatrist.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Wellbutrin and Abilify, and risks and benefits of 
possible alternatives, including not taking the medication, with 
this patient.  We discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take this medication as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any questions about medications with the treatment team, and I 
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.
 
#RISK ASSESSMENT
Static risk factors include: Race, Age of onset, single, history 
of psychosis episodes

Modifiable risk factors include: depression, suicidal ideation, 
poor coping skills, not responsive to past medication.

We attempted to modify these risk factors during this admission. 
 We established outpatient psychiatry appointments to ensure 
aftercare after discharge. We involved patient's mother in the 
treatment course to ensure social support. 

Protective risk factors include: medication compliant, 
established outpatient providers, good family support, life 
satisfaction.

Based on the totality of our assessment at this time, the 
patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others. 

# Prognosis
The clinical prognosis is fair, given the fact that this patient 
is not suicidal/homicidal, is feeling well and is showing 
improved mood and participatory in the milieu, all of which 
indicate a low immediate risk of harm.
