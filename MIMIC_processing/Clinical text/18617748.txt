History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of asthma,
diabetes, hypertension and vision impairment (legally blind)
presenting with dyspnea and wheezing for 1 day. 

Ms. ___ reports that she has had intermittent symptoms of
worsening asthma over the last 2 months (triggered following a
cold, reportedly) for which she has needed increased rescue
medications. She reports that her symptoms were ok when she saw
her PCP last week however worsened on ___, with
worsening wheezing, shortness of breath and non-productive 
cough.
She is baseline on Advair and albuterol which she was taking
regularly (every few hours) but was running out, prompting her 
to
come to the ED for evaluation. She reports she has had no recent
fevers, chills or productive cough. She denies rhinorrhea or
congestion. She does note that her husband had a "bug" the last
few days (URI symptoms and ? fever) though notes they were
sleeping in different rooms so she wouldn't catch it. She has no
new environmental exposures. Her symptoms were also accompanied
by associated chest tightness and nausea. She has had no
vomiting, fevers, chills. No abdominal pain or diarrhea. Given
worsening SOB, she presented to the ED via ambulance for
evaluation. 

In the ambulance, she received nebs x2. 

On arrival to the ED, initial vitals: 97.2, ___, 22 and
97% on 6L NC. Her exam was notable for tachypnea and diffuse
expiratory wheezes with moderate aeration throughout. 
Labs were largely unremarkable with negative trop x1, no
leukocytosis, Cr 1.1. Her VBG was notable for CO2 of 50 in
setting of tachypnea.
CXR on my read showed mild hyperinflation without evidence of
consolidation or other acute abnormalities.
She was given pred 60mg x1, magnesium sulfate IV, 1L LR and
duonebs x1. 
Given ongoing significant wheezing and RA oxygen saturation of
88-90%, decision was made to admit to medicine for further
evaluation and treatment. 
Peak flow prior to departure from ED: 250

On my evaluation of the patient in the ED, she reported feeling
much better though still some SOB. She was on oxygen (2L) at the
time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of adult onset 
asthma, diabetes, hypertension and vision impairment (legally 
blind) presenting with acute on subacute dyspnea and wheezing 
consistent with acute asthma exacerbation. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#Dyspnea
#Acute asthma exacerbation
#Moderate persistent asthma
Presented with recurrent asthma exacerbation with fairly poorly 
asthma control recently with several possible contributing 
factors including recent move to new home (6 months ago) and new 
cat (4 months ago). She denies clear allergic symptoms however 
given these changes was started on cetirizine for possible 
allergic trigger of her asthma. Her acute exacerbation was 
treated with PO prednisone 40mg daily (___) and duonebs. 
Given her poor recent control, montelukast was also added as a 
controller medication for her asthma. She is being discharged on 
albuterol inhaler and nebs prn. At time of discharge, she has 
some mild wheezing at bases with good air movement and was 
satting well on room air. She will need outpatient PFTs and pulm 
follow-up given recent worsening baseline asthma control 
recently with multiple exacerbations. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
#Type II diabetes: Continued on home glargine and started on 
HISS while in house. Trulicity and metformin held on admission 
and restarted at time of discharge. 

#Hypertension: Patient was continued on home HCTZ and 
spironolactone per patient report of home BP meds. At___ 
records note patient is taking labetalol BID as well though 
patient stated this is not the case. 

#Hyperlipidemia: Continued home atorvastatin.

#GERD: Continued home pantoprazole BID. 

#Autoimmune eye disease: Patient's eye drops were held as they 
were nonformulary. Restarted on discharge. Home prednisone was 
held given above pred burst with plan to restart prednisone 5mg 
daily on ___. 

Transitional Issues
====================
[ ]Started on cetirizine and montelukast for asthma control with 
possible allergic component
[ ]Patient would benefit from outpatient PFTs and pulm follow-up
[ ]IgE not sent inpatient but can consider sending outpatient
[ ]Clarify home blood pressure regimen - patient reports taking 
HCTZ and spironolactone though ___ records also include 
labetalol. 

[x]>30 minutes spent on discharge planning and care coordination 
on day of discharge
