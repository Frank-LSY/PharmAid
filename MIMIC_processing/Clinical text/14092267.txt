LLE venous Doppler ___
Extensive deep venous thrombus in the left lower extremity 
extending from the common femoral through the calf veins. 

OB Ultrasound ___
The previously described misshapen intrauterine gestational sac 
is no longer evident.  There is a small amount of blood products 
demonstrated within the endometrial cavity.  There is no 
sonographic evidence for vascularized retained products of 
conception.  This is consistent with SAB in progress.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F PMhx G5P4, 7 weeks pregnant, admitted last night with 
threatened abortion and new L lower extremity DVT, status post 
initiation of anticoagulation, course complicated by completion 
of spontaneous abortion

# Acute L Common Femoral DVT  Patient presented with worsening 
LLE pain and swelling.  Ultrasound showed acute L common femoral 
DVT.  Patient was started on on heparin drip given concurrent 
vaginal bleeding and uncertainty regarding her pregnancy (see 
below).  Once her spontaneous abortion was completed, she was 
presented with the various options of treatment and preferred a 
lovenox bridge to therapeutic warfarin. She was discharged to 
take 5mg warfarin daily and will follow-up with her PCP for INR 
monitoring.

# Spontaneous Abortion  Prior to presentation, patient had seen 
her Obgyn with vaginal bleeding and had been found to have a 
threatened abortion.  Given persistent vaginal bleeding and 
downtrending serum hCG, patient underwent repeat vagina 
ultrasound which no longer visualized gestational sac, 
indicating completion of spontaneous abortion.  OBGYN discussed 
with patient, and social work provided support.
