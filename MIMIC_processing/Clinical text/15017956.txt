Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with longstanding history of 
epilepsy, prior neurosurgery, intellectual disability all 
possibly related to viral encephalitis as a child, who presented 
with breakthrough seizures over the prior 48 hours.
Seizures appear his usual semiology and have all been brief. 
Initial concern for infection as trigger w/ reported fever on 
admission but no clear infectious etiology, and fever quickly 
defervesced, BCx & UCx NGTD. Has a reported hx of lyme but proxy 
reports this has been treated empirically w/ 2wks of 
doxycycline. His medications have been adjusted over the last 
weeks so would also consider ineffective regimen, levels 
pending. Despite these seizures he appears at his neurological 
baseline per healthcare proxy. LP not obtained d/t therapeutic 
INR on warfarin. Other infectious work-up was unremarkable, 
although nml WBC may be elevated compared to pancytopenic 
baseline. Remained hemodynamically stable and without 
breakthrough seizures 48 hours off broad spectrum antibiotics. 
Course c/b agitation w/ verbal & physical aggression towards 
staff, requiring sitter/restraints (now resolved). Discharged 
back to facility after 24 hrs off restraints/sitter.
