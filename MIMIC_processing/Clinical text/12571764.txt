anxiety, brought in by campus police after ___ suicidal 
statements to friends. 
.
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, Ms. ___ signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout the hospitalization.  She was placed on 15 minute 
checks status (least restrictive) on admission and remained on 
that level of observation throughout while being unit 
restricted.  The patient did not require behavioral or chemical 
restraints during this hospitalization.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Unspecified anxiety disorder
On presentation to the ED on ___, Ms. ___ 
endorsed ___ multiple friends that she was suicidal, 
reportedly in order to gain attention but not anticipating that 
anyone would call ___. She described chronic passive SI as 
chronic (for years), and occurring in the setting of feeling 
worthless due to perceived social deficiencies and social 
anxiety, despite achievements in other domains (especially 
academic achievement). She was markedly pessimistic about her 
ability to recover and about the potential for treatment to be 
beneficial. Mental status exam notable for fair grooming and 
hygeine, evasiveness and poor eye contact, rapid mumbled speech 
without pressure, inappropriate affect to content including 
artificially cheerful affect, irritability, and grimacing, vague 
but generally linear thought process, and thought content with 
frequent themes of self-hatred and pessimism.
.
During a more extensive conversation with the inpatient 
psychiatry team, patient reported "feeling disconnected" in the 
week prior to being admitted and was "feeling hopeless" on the 
night of presentation to the ED due to significant difficulties 
with interpersonal relationships. Patient described 
long-standing pattern of difficulties maintaining friendships 
with female peers due to low self-esteem focused around not 
thinking that she has anything to offer, that she is 
uninteresting and "awkward", and that she does not have many 
friends (which, in her opinion, confirms that she is not the 
type of person that peers her age would want to spend time 
with). She also expressed concerns around relying on others and 
being vulnerable. She described these thoughts as ego-syntonic, 
yet intrusive and very distressing, causing her significant 
anxiety and low mood. Ms. ___ denied changes in 
appetite, or her ability to function in school. She did enrose 
difficulty falling asleep due to rumination. Her stated goal for 
the hospitalization was to improve her intrusive negative 
thoughts.

anxiety disorder. The obsessive nature of her thoughts around 
interpersonal relationships also raised concern for obsessive 
compulsive disorder.
.
Patient was continued on fluoxetine 60mg PO daily. She was 
started on aripiprazole 2mg po qHS and titrated to 5mg PO qHS 
for augmentation of the SSRI effect and for targeting intrusive 
thoughts and insomnia due to rumination.

improvement in her negative thinking along with improvement in 
her interaction with her friend, ___, who visited her on the 
unit. She was future-oriented, speaking fondly about her college 
studies and her love of dancing ___ and about the writing 
group that she leads. She denied thoughts, intent, or plan of 
harming herself or others and she expressed interest in 
continuing to work with her outpatient providers. On mental 
status exam, patient was engaged and friendly, slightly anxious 
appearing, with euthymic, full-range, appropriate affect, and 
without any evidence of mania or psychosis.
.

and  therefore did not require any counseling or treatment in
