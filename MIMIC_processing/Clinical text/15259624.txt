STUDIES
EXAMINATION:  CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS) 
  
INDICATION:  ___ with progressive dysphagia 1.5 months now 
cannot eat.  Assess 
for acute process.  Neck mass. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed after administration of 70 ml 
of 
Omnipaqueintravenous contrast material. MDCT acquired helical 
axial images 
were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the skull base.  
Coronal and 
sagittal multiplanar reformats were then produced and reviewed. 
  
DOSE:  Total DLP (Body) = 334 mGy-cm. 
  
COMPARISON:  None. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
There is no definite evidence for a foreign body.  No soft 
tissue gas.  The 
vocal folds appear somewhat thickened which can be correlated 
with direct 
inspection.  The lingual tonsils are mildly prominent likely 
reactive.  
Adenoids and palatine tonsils appear unremarkable.  The 
submandibular and 
parotid glands are normal.  The imaged teeth appear 
unremarkable.  No sinus 
disease.  Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities appear well 
aerated. 
  
No lymphadenopathy is seen within the neck.  The vessels of the 
neck appear 
patent without significant atherosclerosis. 
  
The imaged portion of the lung apices are clear and there are no 
concerning 
pulmonary nodules. There are no osseous lesions. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Apparent thickening of the vocal folds, recommend direct 
inspection.  
Otherwise unremarkable CT of the neck.  No radiopaque foreign 
body identified. 
  
NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ 
with Dr. ___ 
on the ___ ___ at 11:10 ___, 15 minutes after 
discovery of the 
findings. 

ekg ___ Sinus rhythm. Diffuse ST-T wave changes. Consider 
early repolarization  variant. No previous tracing available for 
comparison.

cxr ___
Ill-defined opacity in the left lower lobe can be aspiration.  
The right lung is clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
unremarkable.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION: Mild left lower lobe aspiration. 

GI mucosal path- pending.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ with reported hx of gastritis presenting 
with progressive dysphagia, headache, and B symptoms x 45 days, 
odynophagia, current work-up unrevealing. Patient also 
complained of short episodes of breathlessness - each time had 
normal vital signs including respiratory rate and oxygenation. 
Patient looked very well during admission. CT neck showed mild 
prominence of vocal cords. Strep was negative. EGD and 
laryngoscopy were unrevealing. Likely anxiety-related. Barium 
swallow was normal. Patient was then found to be eating steak 
and mashed potatoes that his family brought in despite reporting 
abdominal pain, odynophagia, etc. He then reported he did not 
want to be discharged, and that he would return to the ED for 
continued symptoms. As he was tolerating a full diet, we 
reassured him, gave him contact #s to establish primary care and 
GI care at ___, and he was discharged home to f/u as 
outpatient.

# Dysphagia: Endorses 45 days of progressive dysphagia, with the 
sensation of food getting stuck in his chest, and difficulty 
with swallowing sputum ___ odynophagia. Given his drenching 
night sweats and chills, consider OI though not obvious on EGD. 
Denies black stools as initially reported, instead reports 
phlegmy stools. 

Initial ENT laryngoscopy revealed mild erythema, more consistent 
with GERD-related changes. EGD did not show any gross 
abnormalities (a small white patch only), biopsies were normal. 
Ddx also includes eosinophilic esophagitis, motility disorder 
such as achalasia or ___ scleroderma, less likely to be 
infectious or metabolic (hyperthyroidism, amyloidosis, or 
___ disease) but biopsies pending. CRP 0.5, ESR 2, arguing 
strongly against an inflammatory process such as malignancy or 
infection. History is not consistent with oropharyngeal 
disorders or mechanical obstruction. Barium study of esophagus 
was WNL. H pylori Ab negative. HIV Ab negative. TSH WNL. We 
continued PPI given ?reflux on laryngoscopy, and he was given 
the number to follow up in ___ clinic for motility work-up.

We attempted to educated patient on dysphagia diet given that he 
was noted to eating steak and mashed potatoes that his family 
brought in despite reporting abdominal pain, odynophagia, etc. 
He then reported he did not want to be discharged, and that he 
would return to the ED for continued symptoms. As he was 
tolerating a full diet, we reassured him, gave him contact #s to 
establish primary care and GI care at ___, and he was 
discharged home to f/u as outpatient.

# Night-time ?dyspnea, ?anxiety episodes. Regarding night-time 
episodes of feeling like he can't breathe, unclear that these 
are truly ___ airway issues. His vitals were stable (RR and O2 
sat) during the episodes. CXR, CT imaging, direct laryngoscopy, 
and EGD were negative. ?OSA. ___ need outpatient sleep study 
which we discussed with him.

# Drenching sweats, chills: As above, CRP WNL is very 
reassuring. Weight loss is minimal and reportedly intentional. 
No cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy, no lymphadenopathy 
reported on CT neck. Unlikely to be active TB given risk 
factors.

# Leukocytosis. Infectious work-up revealed aspiration on CXR, 
likely during EGD. Given that leukocytosis is mild, afebrile, no 
hypoxia or cough, would not treat.

--> We referred him to ___ on discharge (does not want to 
go to affiliate closer to his home such as ___). Is 
also apparently considering ___, so this # was also given, 
along with ___ clinic #.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking part in your care at ___. You were 
admitted for difficulty and pain with swallowing. You underwent 
laryngoscopy and had no airway issues. You underwent endoscopy 
and there were also minimal findings. You may have some reflux, 
so we prescribed you a medication for this. You tolerated a full 
meal that your family brought in prior to discharge. You should 
avoid chunky food like steak if you feel dysphagia.
