ACUTE ISSUES:

#Cellulitis secondary to cat bite:
Mild erythema with extension outside previously-demarcated 
borders; suspect that induration at site of bite is secondary to 
tissue injury rather than developing abscess as is non-tender. 
Overall appears to be improving without MRSA coverage though 
resolution has been slow. No concern for joint infection on 
exam. Patient was continued on unaysn overnight with improvement 
in erythema the following day. She was subsequently transitioned 
to Augmentin to finish 5 days of antibiotics.
