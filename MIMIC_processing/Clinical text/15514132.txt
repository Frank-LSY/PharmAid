IMAGING:

CXR/Pelvic XR ___
1. No definite pelvic fracture, though evaluation is markedly 
limited due to underpenetration. 
2. No focal consolidation.  No displaced fractures. 

CT Head ___
No acute intracranial abnormalities on noncontrast head CT. 

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Extensive subcutaneous contusion/hematoma about the right 
base of neck, 
chest, and abdomen. 
2. No acute fracture.  Age-indeterminate mild retrolisthesis of 
L2 on L3, 
possibly degenerative in etiology given the absence of apparent 
fracture. 
3. Small pericardial effusion of indeterminate density.  Cannot 
exclude 
pericardial hematoma. 
4. Small hiatal hernia containing ingested material predisposes 
to aspiration. 

CT CSpine ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment. 
2. Multilevel degenerative changes, as above. 

ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
Mildly displaced, possibly comminuted infrasyndesmotic fracture 
of the distal 
fibula with expected soft tissue swelling.

TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
Redemonstration of distal fibular fracture better assessed on 
the earlier 
dedicated ankle radiographs.  No acute fracture involving the 
proximal left 
tibia or fibula. 

ANKLE 1 VIEW LEFT ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
No evidence of ankle instability with gravity stress in the 
setting of known 
left fibular fracture. 

SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA RIGHT ___
IMPRESSION:  
Ossific density adjacent to the inferior glenoid rim may 
represent chronic 
fracture fragment from the glenoid rim or intra-articular loose 
body.  
However, as this density is not definitively corticated, acute 
fracture cannot be excluded.  If indicated, non urgent MR can be 
obtained for better 
evaluation. 
  

  

 

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service on 
___ following a trauma activation for a motor vehicle 
collision. She was hemodynamically stable in the trauma bay, and 
imaging was obtained of head, cspine, torso, right shoulder and 
left ankle. This revealed a small pericardial effusion, right 
anterior neck/chest/shoulder/abdomen hematoma, as well as a left 
Weber A fibula fracture. 

She was evaluated by Orthopedic Surgery who recommended 
non-operative management after fracture was demonstrated to be 
stable on gravity stress x-ray. They recommended weight bearing 
as tolerated with a short air cast boot. This was fitted 
___, and she was evaluated by physical therapy who cleared 
her for discharge home. 

She was monitored and remained hemodynamically stable throughout 
her hospital stay. Her repeat CBCs were stable, and her pain was 
managed with oral pain medications and lidocaine patch. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

You were admitted to ___ following a motor vehicle accident. 
You were evaluated for any injuries and were found to have a 
fracture of the left ankle as well as bruising of your left 
chest and shoulder. You also had some fluid around your heart 
for which you were monitored. For your fracture, you were 
evaluated by orthopedic surgery who recommended weight bearing 
as tolerated in a special boot. You were evaluated by physical 
therapy and cleared to continue your recovery at home. 

Please see below for more detailed instructions. 

* Try to ambulate and move around to prevent blood clots with 
the air cast boot and crutch as Physical Therapy demonstrated. 

* When you are sitting or lying down, please elevate your leg to 
reduce swelling. 

* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of your pain. If the pain medication is too sedating take half 
the dose and notify your physician. Do not drive while taking 
narcotic pain medications.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.

* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
