Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout his admission.  He was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Substance-induced mood disorder vs Adjustment disorder
Although at presentation there was concern that patient was 
minimizing his symptoms, he consistently denied significantly 
depressed mood, neurovegetative symptoms, or suicidal ideation 
prior to his current hospitalization. Based on reports from 
patient, friends, and his parents it appears his act of 
impulsivity, suicidal gestures, and near self harm occurred 
exclusively in the setting of alcohol intoxication. Although he 
reports a difficult breakup in ___, he had been coping 
reasonably well previously with only intermittent mildly 
depressed mood and anxiety. He has a robust social support 
network of friends and family and is able to maintain employment 
and hobbies such as badminton. We did not start medication since 
there was ___ clear indication, but did offer PRN hydroxyzine for 
anxiety, which he rarely utilized. After an initial period of 
stabilization and diagnostic clarification, we determined that 
he ___ longer requires psychiatric hospitalization and discharged 
him with a plan to begin outpatient counseling, establish 
primary care, and spend time with his family.
.
3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) problematic Alcohol use
Patient reports that he generally uses alcohol in moderation, 
___ drinks once weekly with friends. However he also reported 2 
episodes of binge drinking approximately 6 drinks, including 
most recent episode in which he became acutely disinhibited, 
making suicidal gestures, and nearly harming himself. Patient 
demonstrated insight into risks associated with binge drinking 
and committed to limiting himself to ___ drinks in the future.
.
4. MEDICAL: There were ___ significant medical issues.
.
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. He 
attended some of these groups that focused on teaching patients 
various coping skills, where he demonstrated good insight into 
his strengths and positive coping skills. He was frequently seen 
on the periphery of the milieu and sometimes interacted with 
peers.
.
#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Held family meeting with patient's mother ___ 
___ -- note "y" not "g") and father 
(___) who flew in from ___ to visit the 
patient. Asked about changes they noticed, patient's mother 
reports feeling concern that he was suffering because he was not 
opening up after the breakup or talking about his feelings. He 
said everything was fine and seemed to be distracting himself by 
working more. There were ___ safety concerns and he seemed to be 
keeping up with work and maintaining friendships. They were 
worried after hearing he had been hospitalized and decided to 
fly in to be with him. They were in agreement with plan for 
discharge.
.
#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: none
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: arranged intake with PCP and 
counselor
- Behavioral Interventions: encouraged positive coping skills 
.
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based on collateral reports 
concerning for near suicide attempt, as well as initial 
minimizing of events by patient and lack of outpatient 
treatment. His static factors noted at that time included male 
gender, age, and single relationship status.  The modifiable 
risk factors included suicidal ideation/ gesture, acute 
intoxication, ___ established outpatient providers, decreased 
___, and recent personal loss (breakup). There were 
addressed through hospitalization for acute stabilization, 
individual therapy, group therapy, and aftercare planning. The 
patient is being discharged with many protective risk factors, 
including sense of responsibility to family, employment, 
future-oriented viewpoint, strong social supports, lack of 
current suicidal ideation, ___ prior suicide 
attempts/self-injurious behavior, ___ access to lethal weapons, 
reality-testing ability, good coping skills, good 
problem-solving skills; these are not sufficient to mitigate 
risk at this time. Patient demonstrated preserved capacity to 
engage in a meaningful conversation about safety planning about 
what he would do in the event of worsening depression or 
thoughts of self-harm or suicide (e.g. contact his friends, 
therapist, call ___, or go to the emergency department). 
Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at this time, 
the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others.
