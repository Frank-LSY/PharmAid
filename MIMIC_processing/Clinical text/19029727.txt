""

In the ED, patient continued to iterate that she did not want to
be here. Per nursing documentation, patient ripping bedsheets
into small pieces, refusing food, sobbing in bed. Requested an
emergency court hearing.

Upon admission to the unit, patient is withdrawn during the
interview, responding to most questions by nodding or shaking 
her
head or responding with one-word answers. She states that she 
has
been admitted "against her will," and wants to leave. States 
that
this is all a misunderstanding and asks this author to speak 
with
her outpatient providers to clarify the circumstances 
surrounding
her admission (however, patient refusing to sign all documents,
so a written ROI was not obtained.) 

Patient states that the last couple weeks have been stressful
because of her academic work but she did not identify any
specific stressors. Denies any neurovegetative symptoms in the
last several weeks, states that her mood has been poor but that
this is a chronic issue for her. Endorses anhedonia. However, 
she
states that she has been regularly seeing her psychiatrist and
therapist and that she never misses doses of her medications
which do help her. Notably, she has only seen her current
psychiatrist once.

Patient states that her roommate "made a mistake" by calling 911
after finding the note while going through her apartment. She
notes that they have been in conflict over the last couple weeks
but is unwilling or unable to describe the precise nature of the
conflict beyond noting that "we shouldn't be living together... 
I
lent him money... he was a jerk." 

A copy of the patient's note is in the chart, and contains 
themes
of anger, hopelessness, and pain. She apologizes to several
family members, noting "I had nothing to live for" and "I leave
behind nothing." She specifically identifies this as her 
"suicide
note," and signs her name and ___ at the end.

She denies that the note is actually a suicide note, describing
it instead as a "cathartic writing exercise." When asked why she
specifically picked writing this kind of note for catharsis, she
was unable to provide a clear answer. She reiterates that she is
not suicidal.

This author spoke with her therapist, ___ 
(___)
who stated that during their ___ appointment there was no
evidence of suicidality. Their visits typically involve work
related to self-regulation, self-esteem, coping skills when she
feels overwhelmed. Academic concerns are a regular theme for 
her.
She expressed some concern that the patient did not reach out to
her prior to writing the note, as she had offered the patient an
appointment yesterday if she needed it.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Legal/Safety:
Patient was admitted to ___ on ___, was offered to 
sign in voluntarily which she declined. She was admitted on 
S12b. She requested an emergency hearing; Notice of Rights was 
offered to the patient which she declined to sign, and emergency 
court hearing paperwork was immediately completed and faxed to 
the legal department. The court denied the request for an 
emergency hearing after reviewing the records based on the 
request not alleging/substantiating any abuse/misuse of the 12b 
admission procedure. The patient remained on 15 minute checks, 
had access to monitored sharps, and was unit restricted due to 
concerns for ongoing elevated risk for harm to self with limited 
insight regarding the suicide note and reasons for admission. 
She remained with good behavioral control throughout the 
hospitalization and did not require physical/chemical 
restraints.

#. Unspecified depressive disorder: 
At the time of admission, patient's presentation was notable for 
profound lack of insight regarding the events leading to ED 
presentation and admission. She minimized the seriousness of the 
suicide note she composed and continued to maintain that her 
roommate calling EMS was a mistake, despite the suicide note 
including explicit details of stating farewell to those around 
her, apologizing for her planned suicide, and having her 
lifespan recorded with the current year marking the end of her 
life. She endorsed depressed mood, anhedonia, poor 
concentration, disturbed sleep, anxiety, feelings of 
hopelessness/helplessness regarding her academic 
responsibilities, and on exam was noted to have psychomotor 
retardation, slowed speech, and dysthymic affect. 

As the treatment team continued to work on rapport-building and 
history gathering (including speaking with her sister and 
roommate with her consent) were concerning for cluster B traits 
including dependency, impulsivity, fear of abandonment, 
intense/volatile relationships with her friends/roommate, low 
self-esteem, hypersensitivity to criticism, and feelings of 
emptiness. She was provided with ongoing individual therapy 
sessions with psychoeducation, and was recommended to have her 
pharmacologic regimen be modified to decrease bupropion due to 
concerns that this was affecting her concentration and 
increasing her anxiety/impulsivity, especially in the setting of 
her feeling overwhelmed with her academic responsibilities. The 
team discussed this plan with her outpatient psychiatrist (with 
her permission) who was on-board, and after the risks/benefits 
of switching from bupropion XR 300mg PO daily to bupropion SR 
150mg PO daily was discussed, the patient communicated 
understanding of the risks/benefits and agreed with this plan. 
She tolerated the regimen of bupropion 150mg SR Po daily with 
continuing fluoxetine 60mg PO daily (her home dose) without side 
effects and by the day of discharge was with notably improved 
mood, euthymic affect, and with reported less anxiety.

By time of discharge, patient continued to decline attending 
group therapy sessions despite ongoing encouragement from the 
treatment team. She did continue to engage superficially with 
the treatment goals and decisions in working towards a safe 
discharge. By the day of discharge, she had consistently denied 
suicidal ideation, was reporting future/goal oriented thought 
about plans to take time off from her program and return to her 
family in ___, continue to work with her outpatient 
providers to continue current medication regimen/optimize as 
indicated, and continue working on coping skills with her 
individual therapist, who was also contacted by the treatment 
team and provided with an update regarding progress and plans 
(with patient's consent).

#. Collateral:
With the patient's consent, the treatment team spoke with the 
patient's sister and roommate. They both stated that while the 
patient has a history of being dependent on the roommate and 
that his recent commitments to work/dating may have decreased 
his availability to spend time with the patient as being a major 
stressor, they were not concerned that the patient would attempt 
to partake in any self-injurious behaviors at this time. They 
both described the suicide letter as part of her therapeutic 
journaling method, and that she would be unlikely to 
follow-through with any suicide plan. They reported that the 
patient does not have any history of suicide attempts or 
parasuicidal behaviors. 

With the patient's consent, the treatment team also spoke with 
her individual therapist and psychiatrist, who were updated on 
the presenting history, signs, and symptoms, and also provided 
with an update of the treatment goals and progress. They were 
both on-board with the plan described above, and they both felt 
that by the time of discharge, the patient would be stable 
enough for ongoing care in the outpatient setting.

The team also contacted the patient's mother with her consent; 
mother also reported not having concerns that the patient would 
participate in suicidal behavioral and that the family is 
planning to have the patient stay at home with them and 
encourage her to take some time off from her academic duties.

#. Risk assessment:
At the time of admission, the patient was determined to be at an 
elevated risk of harm to self based on the above documented 
presenting signs/symptoms, as well as static factors including 
chronic mental illness (depression), Caucasian race, single 
marital status, likely presence of a concurrent personality 
disorder, family history of suicide attempt (half brother 
completed suicide). The following modifiable factors were 
addressed during this hospitalization: suicidal ideation 
(patient was provided ongoing psychoeducation, pharmacotherapy 
adjusted, and by time of discharge was consistently denying any 
passive/active sucidal ideation), agitation/recklessness 
(acutely stabilized in terms of safety/behavior on the unit with 
ongoing monitoring and 15 minute checks, by time of discharge 
was consistently without behavioral issues or safety concerns), 
limited coping skills (was provided with psychoeducation and 
therapy principles in both individual and group therapy 
sessions, but patient continued to decline to attend group 
therapy sessions), impulsivity (bupropion decreased due to 
concerns it may be worsening anxiety/impulsivity), and polarized 
thinking (attempted to have patient be engaged in DBT 
principles, but she continued to decline attending groups). She 
is being discharged with protective factors which include 
help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, sense of 
responsibility to family, reality testing ability, no history of 
substance use disorder, and strong social supports. 

#. Prognosis:
The prognosis remains fair at this time, given that patient is 
willing to continue with care in the outpatient setting with her 
individual therapist and psychiatrist.
