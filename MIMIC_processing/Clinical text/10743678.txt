K-3.8 Cl-101 HCO3-25 AnGap-___ year old Male with a history of chronic stable Asthma  who 
presents with 24 hours of progressive dyspnea and wheezing 
consistent with an asthma exacerbation.

Assessment and Plan:
# Chronic Stable Asthma with severe acute exacerbation: Patient 
presents with shortness of breath, and significant wheezing with 
accessory muscle use consistent with an acute asthma 
exacerbation. Patient meets criteria for a severe exacerbation 
due to RR>30 in the ED, and patient required a 100% NRB mask 
during transport.  Given the patient's symptoms likely 
represents a viral bronchitis type trigger. He was started on 
Prednisone 60 mg p.o. daily and standing nebs until his 
breathing improved and will taper his predniosone 10mg every 
other day on discharge. HIs peakflows improved to 220-285 (at or 
above baseline per patient) and he had spirometry while in the 
hospital as well. He will follow up with his pulmonologist and 
PCP as an outpatient. 

# HTN: 
- Continued amlodipine

# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is not on a rate control agent. 
He presented with RVR in the setting of nebs but that resolved 
with improved respiroaty status. Continued rivoroxaban

# Hyperlipidemia
- Continued Pravachol

# QT Prolongation: Resolved. Note patient has a QTc > 500 on EKG 
in ED. His baseline on prior EKGs is normal at 430.  He was 
monitored on telemetry and repeat EKGs over the following 2 days 
showed a reduction in his QTC down to 450. Bupropion is a QT
prolonging agent, but wish to avoid stopping this in the setting 
of increased anxiety with steroids.  He should have follow-up 
EKGs as an outpatient to continue to monitor his QTC but 
discharge QTc 450. 

Transitional Issues:
[] Follow up QTc on EKG as an outpatient. 
[] Evaluate for the need to prolong his steroid course. 

Greater than 30 minutes spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day of discharge.
