Mr. ___  was seen today for

follow up US. 

Regarding his LUTS, he is taking Tamsulosin 0.8 daily and

testicular
abscess formation.  There is only minimal interval improvement

of the testis and epididymis which is concerning for residual
infection. 
Follow-up imaging to ensure resolution and exclude underlying
testicular mass is recommended. 

Scrotal ultrasound impression ___:
Findings indicate persistent and marked epididymal orchitis in
the left
hemiscrotum.  Focal masslike area within the testis is likely a
hematoma or
infected focus, particularly since there was no focal 
abnormality
on the
initial scans in ___.  There is no evidence of any
resolution of the
epididymal orchitis.

Scrotal US impression ___:
 
Similar appearance of the known epididymo-orchitis to the left
testis and
epididymis compared to most recent ultrasound.  There is 
improved
appearance
