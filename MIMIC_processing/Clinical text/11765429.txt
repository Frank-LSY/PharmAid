These steps can help you recover after your procedure. 
DO drink plenty of water to flush out the bladder.

constipation. Ask your doctor if you should take a laxative if 
you do become constipated. 
Don't take blood-thinning medications until your doctor says 
it's OK. 
Don't do any strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 
four to six weeks or until your doctor says it's OK. 
Don't have sex. You'll likely be able to resume sexual 
activity in about four to six weeks.

You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in

primary care team.  

Unless otherwise advised, blood thinning medications like

after discharge or save until your Foley catheter is removed 
(called a trial of void or void trial).  

You may be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM
