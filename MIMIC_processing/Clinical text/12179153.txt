Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laparoscopic appendectomy and umbilical hernia repair
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with PMHx notable for asthma recently complicated by an 
exacerbation for which she has received a prednisone taper now 
seen in consultation for persistent right sided abdominal pain. 
In brief, pt reports that she first started feeling unwell 
approximately one week ago at which time she developed dysuria 
and urinary frequency. She was treated with ciprofloxacin for a 
presumed urinary tract infection. Despite this, her symptoms 
persisted and she noted a slight worsening of her lower 
abdominal pain which primarily focused within the right lower 
quadrant. 

She has continued to follow up with her PCP regarding this 
abdominal discomfort. Examination there earlier in the day 
revealed worsened RLQ tenderness. Pelvic exam was unrevealing, 
with no evidence of ovarian masses, cervical motion tenderness, 
or discharge. In light of her ongoing symptoms, she underwent 
abdominal imaging via CT scan which revealed an approximate 8mm 
appendix with mild hyperemia and adjacent inflammation. There 
was otherwise no free fluid, free air, or additional notable 
findings which would explain her abdominal pain. She presents to 
the ED now for surgical evaluation.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ from 
the Emergency Department on ___ for Appendicitis. You were 
taken to the OR to have your appendix removed and your umbilical 
hernia repaired on ___. The operation went well without any 
complications and you are now deemed medically cleared for 
discharge home. Please read the following discharge instructions 
to assist with a successful recovery.

 ACTIVITY: 
==========
 o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency. 
 o You may climb stairs.  
 o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
 o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap. 
 o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
 o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming. 
   
 HOW YOU MAY FEEL:
=================
 o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. 
 o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in 
your throat during surgery. 
 o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed. 
 o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing. 
 o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon. 
   
 YOUR INCISION:
===============
 o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay). 
 o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal. 
 o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision. 

 o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area. 
 o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise. 
 o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon. 
 o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming. 
   
 YOUR BOWELS:
============
 o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription. 
 o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.  
   
 PAIN MANAGEMENT:
================
 o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness".  
 o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. 

 o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. 
 o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before 
your pain gets too severe. 
 o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay. 
 o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine. 
 o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
 - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours 
 - pain that is getting worse over time 
 - pain accompanied by fever of more than 101 
 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain 
   
 MEDICATIONS:

you did before, unless you have been told differently. You may 
resume your prednisone taper and you do not need to take any 
antibiotics after your operation.
 If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
