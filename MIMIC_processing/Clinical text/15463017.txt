RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
suicidality, thoughts of going to get a gun, history of hitting 
her fiancé during "blackouts." Their static factors noted at 
that time include history of suicide attempts, question of 
history of abuse, chronic mental illness, history of substance 
abuse, Caucasian race, age, marital status, the chronic pain, 
and chronic medical illness.   

The modifiable risk factors were also addressed at that time. We 
discussed and arranged continuity of psychiatric care as an 
outpatient and the patient's home/academic stressors with her 
and her family.

Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including help-seeking nature, future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family and fiance, reality 
testing ability, good coping skills, positive therapeutic 
relationship with outpatient providers, lack of suicidal 
ideation, and strong social supports. Overall, based on the 
totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at 
an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is fair-good.

MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
Suicidal ideation with plan, lack of outpatient treatment, 
hopelessness, emotional dysregulation with limited coping 
skills, active substance abuse (MJ), impulsivity, polarized 
thinking, and history of physical/emotional trauma from lifetime 
of Crohn's disease. 

PROTECTIVE RISK FACTORS
Help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, sense of 
responsibility to family and fiance, reality testing ability, 
good coping skills, positive therapeutic relationship with 
outpatient providers, lack of suicidal ideation, and strong 
social supports. Thus, I feel the patient does not meet section 
12a criteria for risk of harm to self/others.
