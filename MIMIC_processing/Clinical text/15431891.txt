approximately ___ years ago, while he as in college he began 
noticing that other people were mistaking him for another person 
and calling him the wrong name. He stated that this kept on 
happening and so he went to his "foster parents" and asked them 
if he was adopted, and they told him he was not adopted. Mr. 
___ stated that over the past ___ years he has realized 
that he is adopted (although cannot provide any evidence of 
this, stating he just "knows") and that his "biological parents" 
have had more children who are now hacking into his Facebook 
account, stealing money, and bugging his phone to the point 
where he cannot make phone calls without worrying that others 
are listening to his phone call. "I have no privacy anymore... I 
can't use my laptop, I can't do anything." He stated that he 
recently found out "names" from "someone... people I know" and 
states the names of his biological family are ___, and 
___, whom he thinks is doing the majority of the hacking. 
Patient reports that his alleged biological family have been 
taking money out his bank account, "little sums, like $30 so 
they
don't raise suspicion" and breaking into his bedroom in order to 
steal clothing. 
.

moving from ___ to ___ in order to escape this 
persecution. Patient stated that he is currently living in a 
house in ___ with roommates, whom he does not talk with 
often, and works as a ___ at ___. Notes he 
is struggling at work, as he finds the situation unbearable, 
"can't live the rest of my life like this... I'm going to go 
crazy and hurt myself." Denied having to kill himself or intent. 

. 
On day of presentation, patient stated that he went to the 
police station in order to file a complaint against his 
"adoptive family" who had been after him. He stated that after 
going the police station, "they suggested I come here." 
. 
On psychiatric review of systems, patient reported he has been 
sleeping well, about 4 hours during the day (he works during the 
evening) but sleeps normally when he is not working. Reported he 
has had difficulty enjoying things recently, given the amount of

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old single, employed male with a 
self-reported history of depression and anxiety, s/p one prior 
psychiatric hospitalization 7 months ago, no prior suicide 
attempt, who presented to the ___ ED from the police station 
via EMS after trying to file a report that unknown individuals 
were hacking into his personal electronics. Interview with the 
patient was revealing of 1.5 to ___ years of fixed delusions, 
beginning with believing he was adopted after he had repeatedly 
been misidentified on the streets with an apparent progression 
of symptoms to the point where he believe his biological 
family is after him, hacking into his Facebook account, stealing 
money from his bank account, tapping into his phone 
conversations (to the point where he has changed his carrier 3 
times), and following him after he decided to move away from ___ 
to ___ to get away. In the setting of paranoia and 
delusions, the patient does report some periods of depression 
and describes lowered interest, weight loss, increased stress, 
anxiety, and reporting panic attack symptoms in the ED (although 
patient denied them upon admission interview).
.
Mental status examination was notable for a well-groomed man who 
was cooperative, with depressed mood, somewhat constricted 
affect, delusional and paranoid thought content but with a 
thought process that was notably linear, logical, 
future-oriented and goal-directed. Neurological examination was 
initially concerning for the lack of accommodation in the left 
eye and a mild decreased elevation of the left face; however, 
MRI with and without contrast was negative for any notable 
anomalies or pathologies, and patient did not exhibit or 
complain of any focal neurological deficits. Admission bloodwork 
was within normal limits.
.
Diagnostically, the differential initially remained broad given 
the abnormal neurological examination; however, medical workup 
including neuroimaging was negative as mentioned above. Given 
the patients young age, a primary psychotic disorder is on the 
differential, likely delusional disorder, although schizophrenia 
remains on the differential (although no evidence of prodromal 
period or negative symptoms on my examination). History was 
unimpressive for details suggestive of mania, although it was 
difficult to verify the patients story as collaterals were 
unable to be reached; regardless, this admission presentation 
was unlikely for bipolar disorder. Patient denied a history of 
substance use and his tox screen was negative; it was unlikely 
that substances were contributing to this admission 
presentation. By time of discharge, the persistence of 
nonbizarre paranoid persecutory delusions while still 
maintaining normal executive function, a linear and organized 
thought process, lack of cognitive decline, maintenance of 
normal affect, and a highly systematized delusional belief 
system made delusional disorder be the most highly suspected 
diagnosis.
.
DSM V Diagnoses:
- Delusional Disorder 
.
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted to ___ 
___ Inpatient Psychiatric Unit from the 
ED on a ___. Upon admission, patient signed a Conditional 
Voluntary status which was accepted (___) as well as a 3 
day notice that expired on ___. Patient was placed on 15 minute 
checks and maintained his safety throughout the hospitalization. 
He did not require physical or chemical restraints. Given his 
ability to ___ for his ADL's independently, consistent denial 
of suicidal ideation or thoughts of self harm, and thought 
process that was mostly linear, goal and future oriented, I did 
not feel he met criteria to file a 7&8n on.  
.
#. Delusional Disorder: Patient continued to remain fixed in the 
nature and detail of his delusions regarding his biological 
family pursuing him in ___, hacking into his social media 
accounts, tapping into his phone and laptop, and taking money 
from his bank. Medical workup was negative for organic 
etiologies (TSH, B12, RPR, electrolytes, tox screen) and 
neuroimaging was negative (MRI with and without contrast). After 
discussing the risks and benefits of initiating antipsychotic 
pharmacotherapy, with patients consent, treatment was initiated 
with Zyprexa 5 mg PO QHS which was titrated up to 10 mg PO QHS 
(and formulation was switched from regular tablet to 
disintegrating tablet, Zyprexa Zydis, to ensure patients oral 
compliance). Patient tolerated the medication without complaints 
or adverse reactions and remained cooperative with treatment. He 
was provided with individual, group, milieu, and supportive 
psychotherapy. Delusions remained fixed by time of discharge, 
despite ongoing antipsychotic treatment, but patient displayed 
signs of and self-reported improvement in anxiousness, insomnia, 
distress, and depressed mood. He remained linear, goal-directed 
and future-oriented in his thought process.
.
Ativan 0.5 mg PO BID PRN was offered for anxiety, which the 
patient did not utilize frequently. Patient responded well to 
verbal reassurance, supportive psychotherapy, and standing 
antipsychotic treatment.
.
The treatment team attempted to reach collateral contacts 
numerous times throughout this hospitalization. This proved to 
be difficult as the patient was only able to provide the names 
of his mother and father, with their home address in ___ 
(phone number was lost during the patients most recent factory 
reset of his cell phone, prior to admission). A phone number was 
obtained via online search, but the individual who responded via 
phone call denied the presence of anyone in her family by the 
patients name, and other attempts for contact by leaving 
messages did not ___ a response.
.
Of note, by time of discharge, patient was reporting 
significantly improved mood with consistent denial of suicidal 
ideation, thoughts of self-harm, or homicidal ideation. While 
delusions remained fixed, he was expressing improved insight, 
stating that even with the ongoing persecution, he has found 
techniques he has learned during group sessions to help him 
better cope and to live my life. He verbalized understanding 
of the importance of compliance with outpatient follow-up and 
expressed a strong interest in returning to his work. He was 
noted to attend to his ADLs independently and appropriately.
.
The treatment team attempted to arrange follow-up appointments 
and referrals; a primary ___ provider initial appointment was 
set for the day of discharge in the afternoon at the ___ 
___ Associates Primary ___ 
Clinic with Dr. ___. A referral was made to the PREP 
program at ___, but the program was not open for new 
intakes at this time (regardless, information and contact 
numbers were provided to the patient and he was encouraged to 
re-contact PREP in the future). An outpatient psychiatrist 
referral was attempted but this proved difficult due to the 
patient lacking health insurance; we attempted to assist the 
patient in signing up for ACA, which he declined. 
.
#. Convergence Insufficiency: Upon initial neurologic 
examination, patient was found to lack left eye accommodation. 
MRI with and without contrast was negative for any notable 
pathology, and patient denied any recent or acute focal 
neurologic deficits such as vision changes, blurriness, 
headache, weakness, etc. As the left eye was mildly extropic at 
rest, the finding was suspected to be chronic and not an acute 
issue.
.
#. Sore Throat: Patient complained of a sore throat with 
swallowing in the first few days of admission. MRI with and 
without contrast was incidentally notable for mild enlargement 
of tonsils; a rapid strep test was performed which was negative 
and the patients complaint of throat soreness had resolved by 
the time of discharge.
