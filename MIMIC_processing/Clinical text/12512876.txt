mastectomy with axillary sampling in ___ had a 
left breast wire localized incision with biopsy atypia 
excisional biopsy for a papilloma and a left breast wire 
localized excisional biopsy for atypical ductal hyperplasia. 
More recently, she was found to have a new mass in the upper 
posterior region of the left breast on diagnostic mammogram. 
Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was performed which showed 
ductal carcinoma in situ, low grade, ER positive, with an 
encapsulated papillary carcinoma present as well.  Given these 
findings, surgical options for management were discussed. She 
chose to proceed with breast conservation therapy and underwent 
a left breast wire localized partial mastectomy with the 
intention of trying to omit adjuvant radiation therapy and being 
maintained on wide local excision alone protocol. She was found 
to have appropriate features to the carcinoma on distal 
pathology postoperatively. She underwent a left breast wire 
localized partial mastectomy on ___ which showed ductal 
carcinoma in situ as well as an encapsulated papillary 
carcinoma. Three of the margins were close at/or less than 1 mm 
and were recommended for re-excision.  Given the diffuseness of 
the carcinoma on the lumpectomy specimen, in discussion with Dr. 
___ oncologist, she would be recommended to have 
adjuvant radiation therapy. Given the recommendation of adjuvant 
radiation therapy, the patient decided that she did not want to 
proceed with breast conservation and would rather have a 
mastectomy.She presents for a left total mastectomy with left 
axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy.
