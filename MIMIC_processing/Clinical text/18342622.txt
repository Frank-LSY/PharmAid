History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo M with h/o HTN, HLD, aortic arch atheroma, 
extensive family hx of CAD, who presents with 1 week of 
stuttering chest pain and associated shortness of breath. The 
patient first noticed the chest pain and shortness of breath 
about 1 week ago on exertion, and has continued to notice 
worsening SOB and CP both with exertion and at rest 
intermittently, several times a day. The chest pain feels like 
substernal tightness in the ___ his chest. The CP is 
sometimes associated with tingling in the L arm, and lasts for 
several minutes. The pain gets a little worse when he takes a 
deep breath. No orthopnea, he actually feels better when lying 
down and relaxing. He does feel that his exercise tolerance has 
decreased recently: he says one week ago he could walk 1 block, 
but on presentation he was SOB upon walkign across the room. (He 
says that ___ year ago his ET was unlimited). He notes some dry 
cough that started this week, which does not occur often and has 
no phlegm production.  

Denies fevers, chills, GERD or reflux, n/v/d.

The patient saw his PCP for these symptoms and had an EKG that 
showed new ventricular bigeminy. The patient had negative stress 
test in ___.

In the ED, initial VS were 98.3 76 155/73 16 98% 2L. EKG: Sinus 
w/ Ventricular Bigeminy, no ST/T changes. Troponins negative. 
Cardiology consulted who recommended heparin gtt for unstable 
angina.  

Patient underwent CTA to evaluate aortic arch atheroma, which 
showed no acute process. Patient admitted for workup of UA, 
possible stress v cath.

EKG: NSR with ventricular bigeminy. HR 82. Nl axis. No ischemic  

changes.
  
CXR: NO acute process
  
CTA: IMPRESSION:  
1.  No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or aortic injury. 
  
2.  Stable fatty structure in the posterior left chest 
suggestive of a Bochdalek hernia although incompletely imaged. 

Echo ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline 
normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. A late systolic 
jet of trace mitral regurgitation is present (borderline/mild 
posterior mitral leaflet prolapse cannot be excluded). The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

Catheterization was preformed, and showed no CAD.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with a history of atheromatous aortic disease, 
cardiac risk factors and family h/o presents with a story 
concerning for unstable angina with stuttering chest pain 
progressively worsening to chest pain and SOB at rest.

# SOB on exertion w/ associated chest pain: Negative troponins, 
EKG initially showed ventricular bigeminy, which resolved 
without treatment. As there was concern for unstable angina 
given typical angina story and strong risk factors and famiyl 
history, the patient was initially started on heparin ggt, and 
recieved a dose of plavix. Cardiac cath showed no CAD, so the 
patient was ruled out for unstable angina. Echo showed normal 
EF. Since SOB is now known to be non-cardiac in etiology, and 
the patient does not have HF, the patient should be evaluated 
for other etiologies of his progressive SOB. He has a long past 
smoking history, he warrents pulmonology work up as outpatient 
for evaluation of possible COPD. There were no medication 
changes at discharge. The patient was continued on home ASA, 
lipitor, lisinopril, metoprolol.

# HTN: Continued lisinopril and metoprolol
  
# HL: Continued atorvastatin  
 
Transitional issues
- f/u with PCP outpatient for further eval and treatment of SOB 
on exertion, cardaic etiology is now ruled out

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
1 week of shortness of breath and chest pain. Your symptoms were 
concerning for cardiac disease, so you had a cardiac echo and a 
catheterization. Your cath was clean and showed no coronary 
artery disease. You should follow up with your primary care 
doctor to determine further investigation and treatment of your 
SOB, including evaluation of your lungs.

Continue to take your home medications as prescribed and keep 
all your follow up appointments.
