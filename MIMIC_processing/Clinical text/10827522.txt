2. PSYCHIATRIC:

On presentation to the ___, patient was possibly responding to 
internal stimuli, with a notable disorganized thought process 
and odd thought content. He initially denied suicidal ideation, 
but then stated he wanted to kill himself to nursing staff and 
said that his plan would be to take aspirin. On interview in the 
___, he was unable to fully participate in the interview. His 
answers were intermittently intelligible, but often bizarre or 
difficult to interpret. His answers to safety assessment were 
vague. He notably was uncooperative with establishing a 
comfortable physical distance between himself and the 
interviewer. He also asked for a gun -- then made a gesture as 
if he were going to shoot himself in the head.  

On admission interview, the patient was disorganized and did not 
seem to know why he was in the hospital aside from his 
psychiatrist sending him after discharge from ___ on 
___. Patient denied SI, plan, intent, HI, AH, VH, delusions. 
He was paranoid on interview, stating that he did not feel safe 
in hospital and was worried staff was "out to get him." He could 
not further elaborate on those thoughts. 

Throughout admission, patient continued to have evidence of 
paranoia, repeatedly stating that he did not like this place and 
was insistent on leaving the hospital. He remained largely 
disorganized, concrete, with limited insight, and was 
perseverative on getting a note to retire from work. His affect 
was mood incongruent, inappropriately laughing at times and at 
other times grimacing, closing his eyes intensely for ___ 
seconds at a time. When asked about this, patient stated that he 
was blocking out evil thoughts, though could not elaborate 
further on this. This was suggestive that he may be responding 
to internal stimuli. Patient's presentation was concerning for 
decompensated psychosis. 

Patient was initially treated with zyprexa 15mg nightly, his 
home dose. This was increased to 20mg nightly with limited 
improvement in psychotic behavior and thought processes. He was 
observed self dialoguing by nursing staff. Patient seemed 
somewhat sedated from this medication. As such, zyprexa was 
discontinued and patient was started on risperidone 2mg PO BID. 
Patient was initially resistant to starting long acting 
injectable medication, though after several days on the unit and 
further discussion, patient agreed to long acting Risperdal 
consta 25mg injection. He received the first injection on ___. 
Risperidone PO dosage was increased to 3mg PO BID. Patient was 
additionally started on Cogentin 1mg nightly.
Patient was insistent and perseverative that he needed to leave 
the hospital and return to work, stating he was not having side 
effects from the medication and he felt "upbeat" though this was 
incongruent with his affect. He was noted to be running in the 
hallways and determined to be an elopement risk. He became very 
frustrated when he was told that his treatment team strongly 
recommended he remain in the hospital for further care until he 
gets better, though he was able to remain in behavioral control 
during interviews with team. He remained concrete, though was 
able to converse more easily. He gradually improved. He attended 
groups over the weekend and found to make meaningful 
contributions. When observed ___ he was socializing with 
peers more, appropriate, good boundaries awareness.   On

additionally gave permission for primary team to speak with his 
mother  (completed) and supervisor at work (never returned 
calls). Patietns mother has not seen her son in a year. She 
stated "he is a good boy, I raised him well. He just needs to 
take his medications, but he doesn't take them, what can I

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting risperidone, Risperdal consta, and risks and benefits 
of possible alternatives, including not taking these 
medications, with this patient.   We discussed the patient's 
right to decide whether to take these medications as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team.  The patient appeared able to understand and 
consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself and/or others based upon his 
history of suicide attempts, history of chronic mental illness, 
recent discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit, male 
gender, and marital status (single). 

His modifiable risk factors included unclear suicidal ideation, 
psychosis, disorganized and unpredictable behavior, medication 
noncompliance at home, social withdrawal, limited social 
supports, and poor reality testing. These were primarily 
addressed with medication adjustment, including starting 
risperidone PO and Risperdal consta 25mg long acting injection 
every 2 weeks.

risk factors,  including ___ nature, ___ 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family Mother), life 
satisfaction, reality testing ability, better coping skills,
