.  
On interview, the patients begins by describing her difficult 
relationship with her "soon to be ex" husband. They got married 
last ___ after dating for ___ years. She left him because 
she found out that he had been cheating on her. She knows that 
he has been cheating on her because "Father" told her.  When
asked to clarify who father was, she states that Father is God, 
and he talks to her. The other proof that she has of her 
husband's infidelities is that he is Facebook friends with other 
woman. She says that she has confronted him about this two 
times, one time resulting in her punching him and throwing a 
phone at
him. She states that he then left her. Her mother did not want 
her to live alone, and so she went to live at home with her 
mother.  
. 
At home, her mother "forced fed" her. She states that if she 
didn't eat, her mother would "go crazy" and yell and scream at 
her. The patient says that her mother is the crazy one, and has 
multiple personalities. She and her mother have gone to see a 
therapist, and her mother made her see a therapist on her own as 
well. The patient says that one of her friends then came over to
the house to see how she was, but really just wanted to learn 
the gossip about her marriage. The patient then tried to leave 
the house to go to a motel. Her mother called the police, and 
the police came, but allowed her to leave. She then stayed at 
the motel for a few days. Her family sent the police to the 
motel to check on the patient, and the police then brought her 
to the
___ court. 
. 
Per collateral from the patient's mother, patient started 
smoking marijuana every night last ___. During the ___, she 
started noticing differences in the way that the patient was 
acting, such as the patient would be talking to her grandmother 
who has passed away. She started saying "crazy things" like 
someone had raped her as a child. The mother attributed her odd 
behavior to stress from the wedding. After the wedding, the 
patient started to get worse. She has been staying in her room, 
and writing messages on Facebook. She is irritable and yells for 
no reason. She talks out loud to herself and says that she is 
talking to God. 
.
The patient has also lost about 40 lbs over the past year. She 
has always had "digestive problems" but has never seen a doctor 
about it because she does not want medication that is not 
natural. She goes online and asks the advice of homeopathic 
doctors. Her mother states that when she was younger, she took
antibiotics for acne.  She then developed many food allergies, 
which she attributed to using too many antibiotics. For the past 
few years, she has been doing a coffee enema twice a day. She 
often will do the enema even if she hasn't eaten anything 
recently. Denies any history of anorexia or bulimia. States that

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a ___ year old ___ woman, no formal 
psychiatric history, unremarkable past medical history, daily 
cannabis use, who presented to ___ on a ___ due to 
concern for psychosis with inability to care for herself. Per 
the medical record, patient reported upon interview that she was 
dialoguing with God along with paranoid delusions that her 
husband was cheating on her and that her friends were gossiping 
about her and her mother. ___ from her parents was 
concerning for bizarre behaviors over the past few months with 
patient also talking with deceased relatives. Initial mental 
status examination was notable for expansive affect, irritable 
mood with recent history of assaulting her husband, and numerous 
aggressive and inappropriate messages on social media 
referencing the ___. Patient also noted to have 
poor sleep, decreased appetite, and increased energy. 
.
Diagnostically, differential was broad and included cannabis 
induced psychosis, affective psychosis, specifically bipolar 
disorder with mania and psychotic features (particularly given 
family history), primary psychotic disorder such as 
schizophrenia vs. schizoaffective disorder, and psychosis 
secondary to underlying medical condition. However, given her 
lack of psychiatric history or prior manic episodes as well as 
her rapid recovery once sober, I believe etiology of 
presentation is likely multifactorial with genetic loading for 
bipolar triggered by significant cannabis use.
.
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted on a ___, upon 
arrival to the unit, she refused to sign a CV. Given significant 
concern for inability to care for self given profound psychosis, 
a 7&8b was filed. However, prior to the court hearing the 
patient's condition had improved significantly and she became 
agreeable to hospitalization and working with her treatment team 
and signed a conditional voluntary agreement, which was 
accepted. Of note, she maintained her safety throughout her 
hospitalization non 15 minute checks and did not require 
physical or chemical restraints during her hospitalization. 
.
#. Psychosis: as above, likely multifactorial with underlying 
susceptibility for bipolar disorder with current episode 
triggered by significant cannabis use. 
- Initially, patient was notably isolative and declined 
attending groups; she was noted by treatment team to have 
ongoing significant delusions that she was conversing with God, 
significant irritability and agitation with her family, and 
initial refusal of all medications with very poor insight and 
judgment. Ms. ___ also initially frequently wrote 
letters, demanding money from her parents and ex-husband, often 
made religious references, and sometimes detailed sexual abuse. 
Of note, her parents denied any knowledge of the patient having 
any prior sexual abuse and stated that prior to admission, the 
patient had never mentioned any abuse.  
- After a discussion of the risks and benefits, the patient was 
started in Risperidone, which was titrated to 2 mg po bid with 
significant benefit as evidenced by improved agitation, clearer 
thought process and improved insight and judgment into the 
events that led to her hospitalization. Of note, she tolerated 
this well with no complaints of side effects. Given periods of 
affective instability and agitation, we also discussed the risks 
and benefits of Depakote, which was started at 250 mg po qam and 
500 mg po qhs. Level= 71 prior to discharge and Ms. 
___ tolerated this well without reports of side 
effects. Of note, I also counseled the patient of the importance 
of using birth control and avoiding pregnancy while on Depakote 
due to association of this medication with neural tube defects. 
The patient understood this risk. 
- For periods of insomnia and anxiety, patient was placed on low 
dose Ativan 0.5 mg po prn and required minimal doses. She was 
sent home with a prescription for 0.5 mg po bid prn anxiety or 
agitation with recommendation this be tapered off as an 
outpatient.   
- With psychopharmacologic intervention as well as discussions 
with the patient about the consequences of her impulsive and 
erratic behavior, the patient showed improved behavioral control 
around her family, and stopping sending hostile messages to her 
family members through social media, the phone, or written 
letters. As noted above, her thought process became 
significantly more linear and goal oriented, her engagement with 
her team improved, as did her insight and judgment. Of note, she 
consistently denied suicidal ideation or thoughts of self harm 
throughout her psychiatric hospitalization
- A family meeting was held prior to discharge to discuss 
diagnosis, hospital course, need for medication and safety 
planning, at which the patient and her parents interacted 
appropriately and agreed that she was ready for discharge home. 
- At discharge, the patient denied AVH, denied SI/HI, and was 
agreeable to starting a partial hospitalization program. 
.
#. Cannabis Use disorder
- Patient started smoking marijuana daily in ___. 
She last smoked in early ___, before her separation from her 
husband, as her husband would buy the marijuana for her.  
- Patient was counseled on abstaining from marijuana use and 
educated on the deleterious effects it had on her mental health; 
patient agreed to continue abstaining. Patient voiced 
understanding of the link between her marijuana use and talking 
to God. 
.
#. Constipation 
- The patient reported doing two coffee enemas per day for the 
past ___ years. On admission, patient was started on miralax. 
She reported regular bowel movements during hospitalization. The 
patient was educated about the risks of coffee enemas, including 
electrolyte abnormalities and death, and was advised to stop 
using them; and she stated she would abstain from them. She was 
encouraged to follow up with her PCP to further discuss her 
concerns with constipaton.
