Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was was admitted to urology for right 
obstructing ureteral stone with
acute kidney failure and underwent cystoscopy, right retrograde 
pyelogram, right placement of double-J stent. She tolerated the 
procedure well and recovered in the PACU before transfer to the 
general surgical floor. See the dictated operative note for full 
details. Overnight, the patient was hydrated with intravenous 
fluids and received appropriate perioperative prophylactic 
antibiotics. On POD1, catheter was removed and CT scan for 
residual stone burden was obtained. She had acute kidney injury 
without improvement in her creatinine on POD1 so she was kept 
overnight for observation and consultation with our colleagues 
in nephrology. With gradual improvement she was discharged on 
POD2 tolerating regular diet, ambulating without assistance, and 
voiding without difficulty. She was explicitly advised to follow 
up as directed as the indwelling ureteral stent must be removed 
and or exchanged and to have repeat lab work done.

Discharge Instructions:
-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to

the indwelling ureteral stent.

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter.; This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed.

your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You
