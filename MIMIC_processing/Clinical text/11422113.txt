Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a PMH pertinent for ovarian 
cysts, endometriosis and biliary colic s/p lap cholecystectomy 
___ and who presented with nausea, vomiting and RUQ 
tenderness and who was subsequently found to have leukopenia, 
neutropenia and acute hepatitis with mixed picture, with highest 
concern for drug-induced liver injury.

# Acute liver injury. 
Patient presented to OSH with 4 days of nausea and vomiting and 
was found to have acute transaminitis, with ALT>>AST (ALT up to 
512), elevated ALkP in the 160s-170s, elevated GGT and elevated 
t bili (up to 2.5 on ___.  Of note, she had a recent 
uncomplicated cholecystectomy on ___ for biliary colic.  
Also of note, she started taking ___ supplement 2 months 
ago (class A for liver injury per hepatology), and started 
taking NSAIDs and Tylenol 1 g q6H around the clock for pain 
control after cholecystectomy.  She also takes fluoxetine for 
anxiety.  As part of her work-up, she underwent RUQ US, CT A/P 
and MRI/MRCP abdomen.  Imaging studies did not find any acute 
pathology, signs of biliary injury or leak to explain her liver 
injury.  She was worked up for infectious and other causes of 
liver failure.  Workup thus far unrevealing for viral etiology.  
The most likely cause was thought to be drug injury from 
___ or Tylenol.  The patient was counseled to avoid 
___ in the future.  LFTs were down trending at the time of 
discharge. Work up included:
- ___, PTT without evidence of coagulopathy
- Hepatitis A, B and C serologies negative.  
- APAP/ASA undetectable
- ___ and anti-smooth muscle antibody negative
- CMV, EBV, HIV, anaplasma pending on discharge
- CMV IgM, IgG pending on discharge
- IgG subclass pending on discharge
- CMV VL pending on discharge
- EBV VL pending on discharge
- HAV IgM, HCV VL pending on discharge

# Isolated neutropenia
WBC 3.5, ANC 1350 on presentation with decrease to a nadir of 
WBC 2.2, ANC 660, improved to WBC 3.4, ANC 1,020 on discharge. 
Differential diagnosis includes viral infection which would 
unify acute liver injury and leukopenia (work-up as above), 
component of benign ethnic neutropenia, autoimmune condition 
(though preliminary rheumatologic serologies wnl), drug-induced 
or malignancy. See evaluation of hepatitis, CMV and EBV 
serologies as above.  Also sent for parvovirus Abs/PCR which was 
pending on discharge.  Lyme serologies negative.  HIV negative.  
She should have a repeat CBC drawn at follow-up with PCP.

Transitional Issues
==============
- Please obtain CBC with differential, follow up LFTs, follow up 
coags at PCP appointment after discharge to ensure continued 
imporvement in liver injury and leukopenia/ANC.
-- ANC at discharge: 1.020
-- LFTS at discharge ALT: 389 AST: 160 AP: 159 Tbili: 1.4 Alb: 
3.9 LDH: 19
- If ongoing leukopenia would pursue peripheral blood smear
- Started ursodiol 300 mg TID ___ to be continued until 
resolution of transamanitis. 
- If patient's LFTs do not resolve may need hepatology follow 
up, otherwise no need for hepatology follow up per our team 
given lack of underlying liver disease
- Incidental findings on imaging: MRCP (___) 9 mm hepatic 
hemangioma, corresponding to the indeterminate lesion described 
on the recent CT. 
** Pending studies at discharge. Please follow up at primary 
care appointment:
- Also sent for parvovirus Abs/PCR which was pending on 
discharge. Lyme serologies negative. 
- CMV, EBV, HIV, anaplasma pending on discharge
- CMV IgM, IgG pending on discharge
- IgG subclass pending on discharge
- CMV VL pending on discharge
- EBV VL pending on discharge
- HAV IgM, HCV VL pending on discharge
