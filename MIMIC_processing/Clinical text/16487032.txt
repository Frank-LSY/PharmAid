URINE CULTURE Final ___: GRAM POSITIVE 
BACTERIA.10,000-100,000 CFU/mL. Alpha hemolytic colonies 
consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp. 

___ BLOOD CULTURE: PENDING

STUDIES:
========
CT ABD/PEL W/ CONTRAST ___ IMPRESSION: 
1. 10 cm segment of descending colon, which exhibits significant 

circumferential wall edema.  No evidence of perforation.  
Although there is sigmoid diverticulosis, the bowel wall 
thickening does not surround any single diverticula.  These 
findings may be related to trauma during the recent colonoscopy. 
 Differential considerations include inflammatory or infectious 
colitis.  Ischemic colitis is less likely given patent 
vasculature and normal bowel enhancement.  Malignancy is also 
less likely given recent colonoscopy. 
2. Mild central intrahepatic biliary dilatation of unknown 
etiology.  No 
extrahepatic biliary dilatation. 
3. Numerous prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are 
nonspecific. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
==============
___ with hypothyroidism and hypertension who comes in for 
fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain following a colonoscopy and 
was found to have wall edema of descending colon and sigmoid 
diverticulosis on CT abdomen. Patient received ciprofloxacin and 
flagyl for assumed acute diverticulitis. Will send home with 
ciprofloxacin and flagyl to complete ___cute Colitis vs Diverticulitis: patient presenting with 
fevers, elevated WBC, loose stools, and left sided abdominal 
pain on the same day following a colonoscopy (___). CT 
abdomen revealed wall edema of descending colon and sigmoid 
diverticulosis; however, no focal bowel wall thickening 
surrounding a single diverticula. CT did not reveal evidence of 
ischemic colitis. Given history of recent colonscopy and 
diverticulosis, infectious was least likely cause of patient's 
presenting symptoms. GI consulted who recommended ciprofloxacin 
and metronidazole for 7 days for suspected acute diverticulitis. 
Advanced diet from clear to regular without trouble. Patient's 
WBC returned to ___. Patient was stable upon discharge. 

#Hypokalemia: 3.1 on arrival to ED, likely ___ diarrhea. K was 
repleted PO x2. 

#U/A results: 12 WBC, moderate leuks, small blood, negative 
nitrites, epi <1, few bacteria. No urinary symptoms. Will not 
treat with antibiotics, although is on ciprofloxacin for GI 
coverage. Patient did not complain of urinary symptoms during 
hospital course.

DAILY at home. Continued home regimen with no changes made for 
discharge. 

#Hypothyroidism: on home dose levothyroxine 50mcg per day. 
Continued home regimen with no changes made for discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[]Patient should follow up with both her PCP and GI doctor
[]Patient was noted to have a tortuous colon making 
colonoscopies difficult. Consider alternative methods of colon 
cancer screening
