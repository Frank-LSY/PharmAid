History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old left handed man with history of
recently diagnosed left sided hemorrhagic stroke (thalamic by 
our
CT, ___ with no residual deficits and HTN, who presents
following an episode of expressive aphasia and dysarthria.
History provided by patient and collateral from family. 

Mr. ___ neurologic history begins about 2 weeks ago, on
___.  He was at home in ___ at that time, when at 11 AM
he developed a sudden change.  Specifically, he went to sit down
on a side table next to his bed, when he acutely felt 
right-sided
weakness (he had difficulty pinpointing whether arm or leg was
more affected) and slid off the table, gradually falling to the
floor.  He did not strike his head or lose consciousness.  He 
was
able to get up off the floor and felt that his right leg was
weak.  He walked down stairs and sat on the couch to watch
television.  He reports he did not really register with him that
he was ill at the time or needed to seek medical attention.  He
denied experiencing any visual symptoms, numbness/tingling, or
difficulty understanding the words being said on television.  He
is not sure if he had any difficulty expressing himself, because
there was no one there to talk to.  About ___ hours later, his
wife and daughter came home, and noticed that he had a right
facial droop and dysarthria.  He also seemed confused, as he was
unable to unlock his phone using the password.  He seems to have
no difficulties understanding speech or expressing speech, 
rather
the speech was dysarthric.  He was brought to a local hospital 
in
___, where he was admitted from ___ through ___.  Family
reports that on initial presentation, his blood pressure was 
220s
over 120s.  Imaging revealed that he had a hemorrhagic stroke in
the left hemisphere; we do not have the records and family is 
not
aware of the specific location.  During the hospital course, he
was confused and inattentive for a few days, but gradually
returned back to baseline.  He underwent a workup which included
a TTE which was reportedly unrevealing, and risk factors only
notable for a borderline elevated LDL, for which they did not
start a statin.  They report that the main issue addressed 
during
the hospitalization was his blood pressure, requiring 3 agents 
to
control it.  He was discharged home.

Since the stroke, he and his family report he has been generally
back to baseline, apart from some mild fatigue and feeling cold
often.

This morning, the patient, wife and daughter were visiting
___ to look for apartments, as her daughter is moving
here shortly for her job.  At around 10:40 AM, wife asked him a
question and noticed he had a slurred response that was not
intelligible.  They parked the car and went into a ___. 
There, when asked questions, the patient had minimal to no 
verbal
output.  This was different than his initial presentation a few
weeks ago, as he did not have expressive aphasia at that time 
but
rather dysarthria.  This time, he had minimal to no verbal 
output
for about 5 minutes.  Throughout that time, he was able to
understand speech, follow commands, and move all 4 limbs
symmetrically (family was very familiar with the stroke
assessment used from his recent hospitalization).  After about 5
minutes, he could form some words and say several responses, but
the speech was quite dysarthric.  After a total of ___ 
minutes,
by the time EMS arrived, the patient returned fully back to his
baseline.  He is felt at his baseline since.  Throughout the
entire episode, no focal weakness or numbness, no sensory
changes, no visual changes, no confusion or loss of awareness.

Regarding recent triggers for this event, family denies any
recent changes to his routine.  Notably, they deny any recent
illness, new or missed medications, or recent trauma.
 
On neuro ROS, the pt currently denies headache, loss of vision,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
lightheadedness,
vertigo. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech. 
Denies focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. Denies difficulty
with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt currently denies recent
fever or chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or
tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rash.

===============================================
Imaging: 
___ ___, CTA head/neck: 
1. Hypodense focus in the right corona radiata could represent 
sequela of 
infarct, acuity uncertain.  Additional foci of bilateral basal 
ganglia 
hyperdensity may represent chronic lacunar infarcts.  A likely 
hemorrhagic 
left thalamic subacute infarct is noted. 
2. Multifocal narrowing of the bilateral ACA, MCA and PCA, felt 
to likely 
represent atherosclerotic disease, with vasospasm a differential 

consideration.  Focal narrowing of the basilar artery is also 
noted.  There is no occlusion. 
3. Unremarkable CTA of the neck. 
4. MRI head, if there are no contraindications would be more 
sensitive for the findings of acute infarct. 
5. Additional findings as described above. 

___ MRI brain w/o contrast: 
1. Small elongated acute infarction in the right corona radiata 
extending into the right superior frontal gyrus parasagittally. 
2. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left medial thalamus 
measuring up to 1.3 cm, presumably representing hemorrhagic 
transformation of left thalamic infarct described in clinical 
history. 
3. Scattered chronic microhemorrhages. 
4. Moderate probable chronic small vessel ischemic changes. 
5. Additional findings as described above. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old left-handed man with history of HTN 
and recent L thalamic hemorrhagic stroke (___) with no 
residual deficits who presents following an episode of 
expressive aphasia and dysarthria. 

#Transient Ischemic Attack: 
#Acute Ischemic Stroke: 
The episode consisted of 5 minutes of nearly no speech output 
followed by ___ minutes of slurred speech before spontaneously 
resolving. Exam nonfocal. It is most likely that the event 
reflected a nonfluent aphasia that improved with subsequent 
dysarthria lasting another several minutes. This event likely 
localizes to the L frontal lobe, likely cortical or subcortical, 
less likely deep. Imaging shows subacute L thalamic hemorrhage, 
acute infarct R frontal corona radiata, as well as diffuse 
microvascular changes and <5 microbleeds. This acute R-sided 
infarct does not explain his presentation. 
His CTA also showed diffuse intracranial stenoses, likely 
atherosclerotic. Radiology considered vasospasm in the imaging 
ddx, but he has no clinical features of vasospasm such as RCVS 
including no headache/thunderclap. Therefore these stenoses were 
felt likely atherosclerotic. 

His presenting event was likely true embolic transient ischemic 
attack. Given L hemispheric TIA + R frontal infarct, suspicion 
is therefore high for cardioembolic source of infarction. 

Records obtained from his recent admission at ___ 
___ in ___ show: 
unremarkable echocardiogram without cardioembolic source and 
only mild LVH. 

His stroke risk factors include the following:  
 1) Hypertension 
 2) intracranial atherosclerosis  
 3) Hyperlipidemia  
 4) Possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy 

He was started on ASA 81mg daily, atorvastatin 20mg daily.

#HTN- his regimen after his recent discharge included amlodipine 
10mg daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily and hydralazine 100mg q8h. 
Hydralazine and lisinopril were held on admission for permissive 
hypertension. Amlodipine was restarted to avoid extreme 
hypertension. Lisinopril was then re-added on ___. 
Hydralazine was stopped due to difficutly with tid dosing and 
blood prssures under moderate control. Lisinopril had just been 
restarted on the day of discharge, and it was also felt that 
adding back both at the same time could result in hypotension. 
SBP was stable 140-160 range prior to discharge. We instructed 
him to have his blood pressure checked at his PCP ___ ___ 
days and discuss potentially restarting hydralazine vs another 
antihypertensive. 

=======================================================
Transitional Issues: 
[ ] PCP: monitor BP and adjust medications as needed. Goal 
normotension. 
[ ] PCP: refer to local neurologist
[ ] PCP: recheck lipids in ~6 weeks given started atorvastatin 
this admission

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of ___ minutes of 
difficulty speaking then slurred speech resulting from an 
TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is temporarily 
blocked by a clot. You were also found to have a recent silent 
stroke. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms. 
You also had a silent ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition in 
which the blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the 
brain is blocked and causes an area of permanent damage. This 
was small and did not cause you any symptoms. 

You also have several tiny areas of bleeding in the brain, 
called 'microhemorrhages'. These can be a sign of a condition 
called Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy, which can lead to strokes 
and an Alzheimer-type dementia. We are not sure that you 
actually have this problem, but it is possible that it is in the 
very early stages.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy

We are changing your medications as follows:  
START aspirin 81 mg daily ("baby aspirin" daily) to reduce your 
risk of another stroke
START atorvastatin (a cholesterol medicine)
STOP Hydralazine (a blood pressure medication) and closely 
follow your blood pressure with your primary care physician 

___ take your other medications as prescribed. 
 
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
