Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with a history of

a left knee replacement revision ___ morning. The procedure 
went well. That evening 10PM he noticed mild numbness on the 
right lower half of his face and inside his mouth "exactly like 
when you get Novacaine at the dentist", and by midnight the 
numbness became more intense and he noticed mild slurring of his 
speech. A head CT was done which was normal. His symptoms were 
attributed to the endotracheal tube in his mouth during the 
surgery. By the next morning on ___, his speech was more 
slurred, so neurology was consulted and an MRI was done which 
showed an acute left midbrain infarct, so arrangements were made 
to transfer him to ___ for further management. He arrived 1AM 
on ___.

IMAGING

CTA HEAD AND CTA NECK
1. Punctate focus of hypodensity within the left midbrain, 
correlating with
the patient's known acute infarction as seen on outside hospital 
MRI performed
the day prior.
2. No additional sites of territorial infarction.  No 
hemorrhagic conversion.
3. Patent intracranial and cervical vasculature without 
high-grade stenosis,
occlusion, or dissection.

TTE
LVEF 65%. Suboptimal image quality. No source of embolus 
identified. Mildly dilated ascending aorta and aortic arch. 
Grossly normal biventricular structure and function. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ right-handed man with history notable for SVT s/p 
ablation, HTN, and PE & DVT in setting of testosterone therapy 
transferred from ___ with right-sided facial numbness and 
dysarthria on the evening after a morning TKR, found to have 
left midbrain ischemic infarct on MRI. Given location of the 
infarct, small vessel disease more likely etiology than 
cardioembolic source despite history of DVT/PE and recent 
surgery. Echocardiogram accordingly negative for PFO/ASD as well 
as thrombus. Reassuringly, evaluation for hypercoagulability in 
___ was also negative per ___ records. Given new stroke on 
aspirin, antiplatelet therapy changed to clopidogrel 
indefinitely, and atorvastatin therapy started for LDL of 100. 
DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin for four weeks following surgery 
date, as well as opioid analgesic and bowel regimen, continued 
as planned for discharge from ___. Evaluation by physical 
therapy recommended discharge home with home ___ services.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

please review and adjust analgesic regimen as needed.
2. DVT prophylaxis for four weeks with enoxaparin.
3. Home skilled nursing, physical therapy, and speech therapy 
services.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were transferred to ___ for 
evaluation of right facial numbness and difficulty speaking 
resulting from an acute ischemic stroke, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 - High blood pressure
 - Obstructive sleep apnea
 - High cholesterol
 - Prior DVT/PE

We are changing your medications as follows:  
 - SWITCH aspirin to clopidogrel 75 mg daily
 - ADD atorvastatin 40 mg daily  

You were also continued on pain medications (with oxycodone 
replacing your home tramadol) and medications to prevent 
associated constipation as recommended by your orthopaedic 
surgeons; you were also continued on an injection (enoxaparin) 
to prevent blood clots related to your knee surgery, which you 
will need to take for a total of four weeks from your surgery 
date. Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team
