endorsed intense stressors, with her mother very sick from stage 
4 breast cancer, who is cared for by her father, who actively 
has alcohol problems. Upon admission, patient denied any 
additional suicidal or self harming thoughts. Of note, patient's 
examination and treatment were hindered by patient's 
inconsistent reports. 

Patient was initially provided with pharmacologic support for 
sleep (+Hydroxyzine and home med Clonazepam), with good effect. 
Patient reported some improvement with depressive and anxiety 
symptoms given a change of environment and support. Patient was 
started on Bupropion ___ 75 mg PO total daily (divided into 2

meds Clonazepam 1 mg PO QHS in addition to Vistaril 25 mg po prn

groups and participated on a regular basis. Patient reported 
finding the coping skills groups especially helpful, and showed 
the team a notebook with notes taken from this group.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE: 
Patient denied any acute or chronic issues. However, patient's 
initial presentation was in the context of acute alcohol 
intoxication. Discussed substance use at length with patient, 
including the risk of rare and intermittent use, given her 
coping skills and strong family history of alcohol use disorder.

MEDICAL:
#) Migraine: Patient reported history of migraine headaches, 
recently unresponsive to NSAIDs and weekly, which have been 
increasing in frequency and intensity over the past month. 
Several days into patient's admission she reported migraine, 
with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea with subsequent emesis, 
pain
that awoke her from sleep during the night. No identifiable 
aura. Patient was first provided with supportive care, 
encouraging rest, dim lighting, and hydration. Given that 
patient's report of failed NSAID therapy and supportive care, 
patient was provided with abortive therapy, Sumatriptan 
Succinate 25 mg PO and Ondansetron 4 mg PO Q8H PRN nausea, with 
good effect. 
      -At discharge, an appointment was made with outpatient 
neurologist given that headaches awoke patient from sleep and 
the worsening frequency and intensity of headaches.

disordered eating, last active in ___. Discussed this at length 
with patient. Denied any current restrictive or binging 
behaviors as well as ruminative thoughts about body size and 
intake.

# Risk Assessment:
Will note that while patient represents a chronic risk impulsive 
and potentially dangerous behaviors given multiple risk factors, 
including difficulty expressing herself, inability to reach out 
for help, ongoing verbal abuse, evidence of impulsivity, 
educational attainment, family history of mental health 
problems,
currently no established relationships with outpatient 
psychiatric providers, and accessibility to self injurious 
materials (exacto blades, alcohol, OTC meds). Patient is 
currently in good behavioral control, and future oriented (with 
plan to return to school and see friends). She has strong family 
support, strong peer support, potential for well structured 
psychiatric and psychosocial support system within her school, 
and future oriented. She is therefore not at any significant 
elevated acute risk at this time to warrant inpatient 
hospitalization.
