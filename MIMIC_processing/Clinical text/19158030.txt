History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old woman with a  past medical
history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the
ED with acute onset left facial droop and slurred speech this
morning. 

History is obtained from patient and her husband at bedside. 
Patient and husband both report that she went to sleep last 
night
in her usual state of health, with no left facial droop; this is
the last time she was known well.  Patient woke up earlier than
her husband, and she said that she did some laundry and then 
went
to a local grocery to get a breakfast sandwich, but when she got
there they did not have what she wanted so she drove back home
after buying nothing.  Her husband was awake when she got home,
and he was talking to her from the other room.  At this time, he
says that he felt that her speech seemed a little bit off.  He
thinks this was about 9 AM.  He was then watching her make
breakfast, and he noticed that when she was cutting the bagel,
and sensitive slicing the bagel lengthwise, she used a knife and
cut a chunk out of the bagel, and then tried to stuff the whole
thing in the toaster.  This was very unusual for her, as she
often makes breakfast without any issue.  He also mentions that
she was cooking bacon and eggs and a "funny way" but could not
give me more details on this.  They then sat down to eat, and he
felt that the left side of her face was drooping.  When she 
would
eat, a little bit of drool her food was falling out of the left
side.  He also felt that when she was eating, she would have 
food
on her left lower face, but she could not feel that this was
there.  As her speech continued to be a little slurred, he
decided to call EMS because he was concerned she was having a
stroke.  They were brought directly to ___. currently,
patient's husband feels that her speech is not back to normal,
and that her left facial droop persists. 

In terms of her past medical history, patient has not seen a
doctor for many years.  Right after ___, the
patient developed a pretty serious nosebleed and presented to 
the
ED for attention.  There, she was diagnosed with hypertension 
and
has subsequently been following up with primary care doctor.  
She
has been started on atorvastatin, valsartan and amlodipine. 
These medications were started the first week of ___, and
since initiation she has been compliant with this regimen.  She
has a blood pressure checked every few weeks, and says that last
week her systolic blood pressure was 130.

Notably, patient has a large ulcerated lesion in her left lower
lip.  She says that this has been there for a few months.  She
says that she spoke to her by her primary care doctor about it,
and was given a cream and was told it was a cold sore.  It is
unclear if she is followed up with her primary care doctor since
the lesion did not resolve on its own.  She says that it has 
been
getting bigger.  She has not had a biopsy. 

On review of systems, patient endorses intermittent tingling in
the tips of her fingers bilaterally after returning to warmth
from being outside in the cold.  She also endorses long-standing
ear issues as she had multiple ear surgeries as a child, but she
is not currently experiencing tenderness.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae (except as above). No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

In the ED, ___ showing acute right MCA infarct. CTA showing 
right
M2 cutoff. Discussed with stroke fellow the consideration of
thrombectomy, as patient was within 24 hours of LKW. However, at
the time of this discovery (3:18pm), patient's repeat
neurological exam was overall stable. On repeat exam she
extinguished to DSS, and she had decreased pinprick (though not
absent) on the left compared to the right (NIHSS 3). Decision 
was
made to load with Plavix 600mg in the ED and start aspirin 81mg,
with plan to continue Plavix 75mg daily and ASA 81mg daily.

toothpaste on tooth brush etc) she was unable todo this. She was
not neglecting either side. She did seem rather blasÃ© about the
fact that she might have a stroke.
