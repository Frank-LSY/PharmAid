History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w/ hx of lupus nephritis on CellCept, 
prednisone taper, and tacrolimus who was referred in for 
abnormal labs that were drawn 3 days ago(K 6.0 BUN 35, Creat 
1.39 ___ 0.7]), in setting of intermittent episodes of 
intermittent metallic taste in his mouth and whole body 
numbness/tingling that lasts ___ hours and have been occurring 
approximately 3x/day for the last week. These episodes have 
occurred with less frequency in the past but severe enough that 
he has had to leave from work. He denies any fevers, changes in 
vision, SOB, c/p, abd pain, dysuria, changes in urination or 
hematochezia.  He was recently diagnosed with bronchitis and 
finished a course of Bactrim 2 days ago.  He also had a bout of 
diarrhea over the weekend that "kept him on the toilet" but has 
since resolved.  He now feels better but still experienced 
tingling earlier today.
 
In the ED, initial vitals: T 97.3, HR 80, BP 123/63, RR 18, 100% 
RA
  
Labs were significant for  
- CBC: WBC 18.2 (92%n), Hgb 11.7, Plt 469

- Lytes:
 
136 / 106 / 29  
-------------- 85 
7.0 \ 20 \ 1.0

- Potassium trend: 7.0 -> 6.6 -> 5.7  

Renal was consulted, and recommended urine lytes, u/a, UPCR, 
renal u/s

Imaging was significant for: renal ultrasound showing slightly 
increased cortical echogenicity suggestive of chronic medical 
renal
disease. No hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hyperkalemia 
___ be related to dehydration from diarrhea as well as 
tacrolimus inhibition of Na-K ATPase and RAAS inhibition from 
lisinopril and losartan. Had peaked T-waves on presentation in 
ED when K was 7. Given calcium, insulin, and ultimately Lasix 
for elimination while holding contributing medications. K now 
normalized and stable.
- Okay to resume tacrolimus
- Continuing to hold lisinopril and losartan
- Patient will have labs checked in ___ days

Aggressive antihypertensive and, in patients with proteinuria, 
antiproteinuric therapy with blockade of the renin-angiotensin 
system is used to help prevent nonimmunologic factors which 
result in progression. In patients with nondiabetic chronic 
kidney disease, the reduction in proteinuria appears to be 
greater when ACE inhibitors are used in combination with ARBs 
than with either drug alone, although no study has compared 
combination therapy with doubling the dose of a single agent. 
However, it has not been proven that combination therapy 
improves renal outcomes and adverse effects may be more common. 
Given the lack of proven benefit and the potential harms 
demonstrated in various large trials (ie, ONTARGET, ALTITUDE, ___ 
NEPHRON-D), using combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and 
ARBs in patients with nondiabetic CKD with the possible 
exception of IgA nephropathy is not recommended.

# Lupus nephritis
- continue MMF, plaquenil, and prednisone 

Mr. ___ was seen and examined on the day of discharge and is 
clinically stable for discharge today. The total time spent 
today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care 
was greater than 30 minutes.

Instructions:
