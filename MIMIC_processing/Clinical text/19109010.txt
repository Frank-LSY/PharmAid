History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMHx anxiety, depression, and prior 
history of ?tumor of the jaw who presents with a syncopal 
episode.

He reports that yesterday evening, he was talking to his 
girlfriend on the phone when she had sudden LOC without any 
preceding symptoms or warning.  The next thing he remembers was 
waking up being surrounded by EMS staff, his girlfriend and his 
son.  Per EMS report, the patient was found initially 
unresponsive and responded to 4 mg of Narcan leading to 
suspicion of possible overdose.  Upon arousal, the patient had 
immediate return to his mental baseline.  He denies any drug use 
or alcohol use and states that he had been in his USOH leading 
up to this syncopal episode.  He does report feeling very upset 
while talking to his girlfriend given recently finding out from 
his dentist that he may need to have all of his teeth of his 
lower jaw removed due to concern of significant dental 
abscess/recurrent tumor (all of his upper teeth were removed in 
his teens because of tumor growth). 

He reports that he had a similar episode ___ years ago where he 
had sudden LOC without prodrome and again awoke following Narcan 
administration.

He reports that his ___ son recently had a pacemaker placed for 
some sort of arrhythmia after a syncopal episode.  He does not 
know what his son's actual medical history is, but states that 
he himself has no known prior cardiac history.  

Upon arrival in the ED, initial VS 98, ___, 18, 97% on 
RA.  Initial labs showed wnl chemistries, negative serum and 
urine tox screens, WBC 11.1, Hgb 15.0, Plt 199, troponins x 2 
were negative.  CXR showed RLL PNA. ECHO showed low normal LVEF 
of 50% but was otherwise unremarkable.  While in the ED, he 
developed substernal chest pain for which Cardiology was 
consulted.  His EKG showed TWI in the precordial leads and 
borderline LVH.  His chest pain was felt to be atypical and was 
reproducible on exam with palpation.  Inaptient admission for 
further monitoring on telemetry was recommended.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient denies any current chest 
pain and otherwise feels well.  He states feeling rather anxious 
and frustrated by the recent news from his dentist that he may 
have to have all of his lower dental teeth removed.  No other 
acute medical complaints.  He denies any fevers/cough/ns, but 
states feeling dyspneic earlier.

Imaging/Studies:  
___ CXR
Right lower lobe consolidation, potentially infection or 
aspiration.

___ ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The 
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF = 50%). Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  

EKG:  
___ NSR with TWI in the precordial leads, borderline LVH

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMHx anxiety, depression, and prior 
history of ?tumor of the jaw who presents with a syncopal 
episode.

# Syncope.  No associated prodrome concerning for possible 
cardiogenic etiology of his syncopal episode.  He has a 
concerning family history of possible arrhythmia.  His EKG is 
overall unremarkable and there is no concern for acute ischemia 
at this time.  His ECHO shows no significant structural heart 
disease.  He does have some atypical chest pain which was 
reproducible on exam, therefore c/w MSK, so per Cardiology, OK 
to defer stress testing at this time.  His syncopal episode was 
initially felt to be related to overdose; however, the patient 
denies any increased ingestion of his klonopin or home meds.  
Serum/urine tox are also both negative. Orthostatics normal. No 
events on telemetry for 24 hours. Per Cardiology recommendations 
patient will be discharged with ___ of Hearts" monitoring 
system and will follow-up in Cardiology fellows clinic with Dr. 
___. 

# Atypical chest pain.  Likely MSK given reproducible in exam.  
Per cards, no need for stress testing at this time.  EKG and 
cardiac biomarkers without obvious evidence of acute ischemia. 
Resolved on discharge. 

# PNA.  RLL opacity seen on CXR. No preceeding fevers, cough, 
dyspnea, sputum. No fevers or leukocytosis on discharge. 
Received 1 dose of levaquin in house but was not discharged on 
antibiotics. 

# Anxiety/depression.
-Can resume gabaepentin/klonipin but counseled on sedating 
nature of these medications. 

# ?dental abscess vs recurrent tumor.
- Continue outpatient work-up
