___ 01:04AM   LACTATE-3.1* K+-5.___ year old female transferred from ___ with acute

Labs showed Hb 20, WBC 50, Creat 1.7, Trop 0.37, BNP 47868. CT

from a late presenting STEMI. The patient's goals of care were

circulatory support and that the risks of revascularization

and return to her previous quality of life if vasopressor and 
inotropic support were pursued. Her family understood this 
information and the decision was made to pursue comfort measures
