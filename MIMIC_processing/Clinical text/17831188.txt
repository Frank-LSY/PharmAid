Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
dizzy, nausea, vomiting
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Patient's daughter provides history with translation from
patient. 
 
Patient is a ___ year old right handed man with past medical
history of severe arthritis of the hands and feet whom presented
to emergency department with chief complaint of acute onset
vertigo with difficulty walking. 

Patient reports that he was at his baseline yesterday and that 
he
went to bed at his usual bedtime of 10:00PM.  Patient awoke at 3
in the morning and immediately felt as if the room was spinning
around himself.  Patient reports that the vertigo is continuous
and has not abated, it has been continuous.  The vertigo does 
not
change if the patient is laying down or if he is standing up. 
Patient cannot walk because of the vertigo.  Patient also 
reports
nausea and vomiting. Patient denies fever and denies concern for
infection.  He denies abdominal pain.  

Patient's daughter reports that patient had a similar episode
like this one month ago, but they did not seek medical attention
because it was not as bad. Patient returned back to baseline
after a few days. 

Patient has left lip ptosis, but patient's son and daughter both
report that it is chronic.  Patient's daughter showed me a
picture of him and it does indeed look to be chronic. 

Patient's right eye is down and in, the son and daughter also
think that this is chronic but are less certain than the left
facial ptosis. He denied double vision. 

Patient reports that he has had reduced hearing from his right
ear for more than ___ years and he has chronic tinnitus.  Patient
denies prior evaluation for this.  

Pertinently, patient received diphenhydramine and metoclopramide
in the ED and hours after I saw him I dropped by to recheck on
him.  He said he felt much better and was no longer vertiginous. 

I re staffed with chief resident and we both agreed to continue
stroke work up given his unknown past medical history and acute,
unexplained onset of symptoms. 
 
ROS: 
On neurological review of systems, the patient denies headache,
confusion, difficulties producing or comprehending speech, loss
of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, and dysphagia.

IMAGING
=========
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of acute large territorial 
infarction,intracranial 
hemorrhage,edema,or mass effect.  There is prominence of the 
ventricles and sulci suggestive of involutional changes.  Subtle 
periventricular and 
subcortical white matter hypodensities are nonspecific, but 
likely reflect 
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 
There is no evidence of fracture.  There is mucosal thickening 
involving the right greater than left maxillary sinus and 
anterior ethmoid air cells. The visualized portion of the orbits 
are unremarkable. 

IMPRESSION:  
There is no evidence of acute intracranial process or 
hemorrhage. 

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Focal intraluminal flap in the left V3 segment of the 
vertebral artery at the level of the left C1 transverse foramen. 
Although this could represent a short focal dissection, there is 
no vessel expansion or hematoma. Findings may represent a 
vascular web. Dissection is less likely in the absence left neck 
pain; correlate clinically. 
2. Otherwise, unremarkable CTA head and neck without significant 
vascular 
stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. 
3. Mildly numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are not individually 
enlarged, 
likely reactive. 

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. No acute infarction. 
2. Chronic findings include global involutional changes and mild 
changes of chronic white matter microangiopathy. 

TTE ___
IMPRESSION: No structural cardiac source of embolism (e.g.atrial 
septal defect, intracardiac thrombus, or vegetation) seen. 
Normal biventricular wall thicknesses, cavity sizes, and 
regional/global systolic function.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
===================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old ___ speaking man with a past 
medical history of GERD, RA (history unclear, does not regularly 
see a doctor) who presented with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and 
difficulty walking. He was ruled out for posterior circulation 
stroke.

#Peripheral vertigo:
Presented with acute onset non positional continuous vertigo 
with nausea
and vomiting with inability to ambulate. Neurology was consulted 
due to concern for posterior circulation stroke. He describes 
his vertigo as "room spinning", improved with lying down. He has 
associated tinnitus bilaterally. His symptoms improved over 
night and are reported as chronic. He had a very similar episode 
one year ago. At that time, he did not seek medical attention 
due to spontaneous resolution. When seen after admission, his 
symptoms were improved. His neurologic exam was notable for 
chronic left lip ptosis with mild left-sided facial asymmetry 
which is chronic, and a swollen left eyelid secondary to recent 
left eyelid surgery. His exam was otherwise unremarkable with 
negative HINTS testing and normal gait. His MRI, CT head, and 
TTE were unremarkable. Central etiology is highly unlikely, most 
likely peripheral vertigo.

#Vertebral dissection:
History of heavy lifting, CTA with focal intraluminal flap in 
the left V3 segment of the vertebral artery. This is likely 
chronic. Did not initiate aspirin given reported allergy.

#Dysphagia:
Ongoing over several months. Occurs with solid food only, feels 
food is "stuck" in his throat. Concerning for esophageal 
dysfunction. Evaluated by speech and swallow, recommended soft 
solids with nectar thick liquids. Will require outpatient 
follow-up.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[] continue to monitor dysphagia, consider barium swallow study 
as outpatient
[] discharge diet: soft solids with nectar thick liquids, 
titrate as patient tolerates, monitor closely for aspiration
[] f/u sed rate, urine culture which were pending at discharge 
 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires 
futher investigation.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___. You came to the hospital because you developed 
some dizziness, nausea, and vomiting at home. These symptoms 
were concerning for a stroke in your brain. We performed blood 
tests and imaging of your brain and determined that you did not 
have a stroke. We also found that you had difficulty swallowing 
and you will need to eat a diet of soft foods when you leave the 
hospital.

Please continue to take your medications as prescribed and to 
follow-up with your doctors as ___.

We wish you all the best,
