Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ male with history of frequent 
falls, CAD (s/p coronary stenting ___ years ago, currently on 
plavix), HTN, HLD, lumbar stensosis who presented to ___ this 
admission as a transfer from ___ after a fall at
home.  At OSH, a CT head revealed a 7 mm hyperdensity in the 
left frontal lobe. Imaging also revealed evidence of left-sided 
facial fractures.  Neurosurgery recommended Keppra 500mg BID for 
7 days, holding anticoagulation for 7 days.  Plastic Surgery was 
consulted for the orbital fractures and recommended no surgical 
intervention.  Ophthalmology was consulted and performed a 
dilated left eye exam, and there were no signs of globe injury, 
optic nerve or muscle entrapment.  It was recommended that the 
patient adhere to sinus precautions x1 week and he may see his 
regular ophthalmologist in 1 week or sooner if he notices any 
change in vision or diplopia. 

Per the patient's HCP, the patient has undergone a thorough 
workup for history of falls.  While working with physical 
therapy, the patient had orthostatic hypotension but was 
mentating well and otherwise remained hemodynamically stable, as 
well as stable from a cardiopulmonary standpoint. Pain was 
managed with acetaminophen and the patient's home medication, 
oxycodone.  He tolerated a regular diet.  After working with 
Physical Therapy, it was recommended that the patient be 
discharged to rehab to continue his recovery.  

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating with assist, voiding without assistance, and pain was 
well controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ after 
a fall and you sustained a mild internal head injury as well as 
a left orbital roof (top section of the bone near your eye) 
fracture.  You were evaluated by the Neurosurgery service for 
your head injury which was deemed stable.  You were started on a 
one week total course of a medication, called Keppra 
(Levetiracetam) to prevent seizures. Your home Plavix was also 
held. The Plastic Surgery service evaluated your left orbital 
roof fracture which will heal on its own.  Sinus precautions 
were recommended for one week.  The Ophalthomology service 
evaluated your left eye and there was no evidence of serious eye 
injury.  

You have worked with Physical Therapy and it is recommended that 
you be discharged to rehab to continue your recovery.  You are 
now ready for discharge, please note the following discharge 
instructions:

Return to the Emergency Department or see your own doctor right 
away if any problems develop, including the following:

 Persistent nausea or vomiting.
 Increasing confusion, drowsiness or any change in alertness.
 Loss of memory.
 Dizziness or fainting.
 Trouble walking or staggering.
 Worsening of headache or headache feels different.
 Trouble speaking or slurred speech.
 Convulsions or seizures. These are twitching or jerking 
movements of the eyes, arms, legs or body.
 A change in the size of one pupil (black part of your eye) as 
compared to the other eye.
 Weakness or numbness of an arm or leg.
 Stiff neck or fever.
 Blurry vision, double vision or other problems with your 
eyesight.
 Bleeding or clear liquid drainage from your ears or nose.
 Very sleepy (more than expected) or hard to wake up.
 Unusual sounds in the ear.
 Any new or increased symptoms

Please adhere to sinus precautions for the next 4 (four) days:

Sinus Precautions:

1. Take the prescribed medications as directed.

2. Do not forcefully spit for several days.

3. Do not smoke for several days.

4. Do not use straws for several days.

5. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even 
though your sinus may feel stuffy or there may be some nasal 
drainage.

6. Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If 
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

7. Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew 
on the opposite side of your mouth.

8. Do not rinse vigorously for several days. GENTLE salt water 
swishes may be used. Slight bleeding from the nose is not 
uncommon for several days after the surgery. Please keep our 
office advised of any changes in your condition, especially if 
drainage or pain increases. It is important that you keep all 
future appointments until this condition has resolved.
