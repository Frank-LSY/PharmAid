Brief Hospital Course:
 
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD#1, paitent had complaint of chest pressure for a few seconds 
while eating breakfast. Denies numbness, nausea or other 
associated symptoms. This was likely secondary to 
indigestion/heartburn. An EKG was obtained which showed sinus 
rhythm. Later in the day, patient reported pruritus and rash to 
chest. A small area of redness was noted likely secondary to 
patient scratching. No rash noted elsewhere. Patient was 
administered Benadryl with relief. Patient continued Oxycodone 
with no further worsening of symptoms.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Lovenox daily for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing will remain on until POD#7 after surgery. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
