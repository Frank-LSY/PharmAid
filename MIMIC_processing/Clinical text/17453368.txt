History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with no history H.pylori 
gastritis and benign parotid tumor s/p resection who presents 
for further evaluation of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, 
subsequently found to have evidence of splenic infarct on 
imaging. 

Last ___, the patient arrived to ___ for vacation and two 
days later developed acute onset abdominal pain with associated 
nausea and NBNB vomiting. She had no associated diarrhea or 
fevers. Her vomiting continued for nearly two days every few 
hours and then resolved while her abdominal pain persisted 
shifting predominantly to her LUQ. No one in her travel party 
developed similar symptoms. Upon returning to the ___, 
her mother noticed that her eyes and skin appeared 
faintly-yellow. Due to these constellation of symptoms, she 
presented to the ED for further evaluation. 

In the ED, patient afebrile with stable vitals. Labs notable for 
stable BMP, slight leukocytosis of 11.4, stable Hg of 13.3, plt 
142, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, INR 1.3, and elevated retic 
count. hCG was negative. Imaging notable for CT a/p with 
Multiple low-attenuation regions throughout the spleen likely 
represent infarcts of unclear etiology as well as bilateral GGOs 
in the lungs. She was given IVF, opioids, and antiemetics. She 
was admitted to medicine for further evaluation. 

Upon meeting the patient, she provides the above history and 
states that she continues to have significant LUQ pain, but the 
medication is helpful. On ROS, she denies dysuria, hematuria, 
frequency. No vaginal discharge or bleeding. No fevers or 
chills. No chest pain or shortness of breath.

IMAGING:
======
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)Study Date of ___
Normal abdominal ultrasound.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRASTStudy Date of ___
1. Multiple low-attenuation regions throughout the spleen likely 
represent infarcts of unclear etiology.
2. Bibasilar ground-glass opacities within the lungs are likely 
infectious or inflammatory, and could represent 
aspiration/pneumonia in the setting of recent emesis, although 
its appearance is atypical for such.
3. Metallic foreign body within the cecum may represent a coin 
or ring, or high density tablet.  If indicated, this could be 
better evaluated or followed with abdominal radiographs.
4. Moderate pelvic free fluid may be physiologic.

ABD (SINGLE VIEW ONLY)Study Date of ___
Dilated transverse colon, consistent with ileus.  No retained 
metallic object

CT CHEST W/CONTRASTStudy Date of ___
Near complete resolution of the ground-glass opacities in both 
lower lobes on the right middle lobe, most likely represents 
resolved aspiration or atelectasis.  No new consolidations.

TTE Study Date of ___
Normal study. Normal biventricular cavity sizes and 
regional/global biventricular
systolic function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow 
identified. Bubble study negative at rest and with valsalva, 
possible R-L shunt with cough, however image quality poor during 
the cough.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINSStudy Date of ___
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity veins.

TEE Study Date of ___
No structural cardiac source of embolism (e.g.patent foramen 
ovale/atrial septal
defect, intracardiac thrombus, or vegetation) seen.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMH H.pylori gastritis and 
benign parotid tumor s/p resection who presented with acute 
nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain, subsequently found to have 
evidence of splenic infarcts on CT scan and hemolysis, 
ultimately thought related to sickle cell trait.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
=======================
# Splenic infarcts
# Hemolysis 
# Left upper quadrant pain
# Nausea/vomiting
Patient became acutely ill on vacation in ___ with acute 
onset abdominal pain, nausea and NBNB vomiting. After return, 
family noticed jaundice and she presented to the ED. During 
workup of her abdominal pain, multiple low-attenuation regions 
consistent with splenic infarcts were noted. Labs showed 
evidence of hemolysis. Initial differential was broad, including 
autoimmune (including G6PD, PNH), infectious, cardioembolic. 
Hematology and Infectious Disease were consulted for assistance 
with workup. 

Hemolytic workup: Hb Electrophoresis showed positive Sickle Cell 
Preparation, rest of panel pending on discharge, thought most 
likely to be sickle cell trait (given absence of sickling on 
peripheral smear), which could explain her hemolysis and 
infarcts in the setting of the stress of her acute illness. 
Hypercoagulable workup negative with Lupus Anticoagulant, dRVVT, 
SCT, Beta-2-Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies (IgA, IgM, IgG), 
Cardiolipin Antibodies (IgG, IgM), ___, Coombs all negative. 
Thrombin was normal. 

Infectious Disease workup: Negative for HIV, Chikungunya 
Antibodies, Monospot, Malaria Antigen Test, 2 parasite smears. 
EBV and HAV Abs indicated past exposure. Immune to HBV. 
Treponemal Ab was positive, RPR negative, confirmatory testing 
sent to state lab, but this was felt likely to be a false 
positive so treatment was deferred. Urine culture contaminated. 
Dengue Fever Antibodies (IgG, IgM), Parvovirus B19 Antibodies, 
CMV IgG/IgM, Blood cultures were pending on discharge. 

Cardioembolic source was considered, TTE overall normal but 
given PFO could not be entirely ruled out on TTE with bubble, 
TEE was pursued, completed ___ without abnormality. She had no 
DVTs on U/S.

Her abdominal pain improved with oxycodone, tylenol, n/v, 
icterus resolved by discharge. Daily hemolysis labs were trended 
per Hematology recommendation. She was instructed to stay well 
hydrated to prevent sickling.

# Cecal foreign body s/p passage 
CT scan on admission with reported metallic foreign body in the 
cecum noted incidentally. Specimen was passed in stool and it 
did not appear metallic. KUB did not show retained contents. 
Patient denied swallowing anything metallic. Did not seem 
related to her abdominal pain.

# Constipation/Ileus
Likely in the setting of opioids. Some concern for ileus on KUB. 
Patient was able to move her bowels with bowel regimen, 
continued on discharge while on opioids.

# Suspected aspiration pneumonitis, resolved 
CT a/p captured GGOs at bilateral bases. Suspected due to recent 
multiple vomiting episodes. Patient afebrile without productive 
cough. CT Chest completed with resolution. Antibiotics were 
deferred given clinical wellness.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Followup remaining workup: Dengue Fever Antibodies (IgG, 
IgM), Parvovirus B19 Antibodies, CMV IgG/IgM, Blood cultures, 
Syphilis testing
[] State micro labs contact numbers for results of Syphilis 
testing (should be ready in ___ days from ___: microbiology 
supervisor: ___ ___ lab supervisor: ___.
[] She will have followup with hematology and infectious 
disease. ___ consider testing for G6PD at that time when no 
longer hemolyzing, but seems less necessary based on positive 
Sickle Preparation.
[] Discharged with short course of oxycodone for abdominal pain.
[] Unclear if patient's sexual partner monogamous based on 
history, would encourage partner to be tested if concerns, 
reinforce safe sex practices 

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

>30 minutes spent on coordination of care, counseling, and 
discharge planning on day of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

We admitted you to the hospital after you had been very ill in 
___. 

We conducted a lot of tests while you were here, and have 
concluded that it is possible that you have sickle cell trait or 
sickle cell disease. This likely caused the blood to break apart 
in the vessels (hemolysis) and the problem in your spleen.

When you leave the hospital, please:
 
**** PLEASE STAY WELL HYDRATED TO PREVENT ANOTHER EPISODE ****

- see below for followup appointments and medicines
- let your primary doctor know if you have any further yellowing 
of the eyes or worsening of your abdominal pain
- as we discussed, you can take oxycodone but be sure to not 
drive and follow other instructions. Oxycodone can make you 
constipated so please take a stool softener.

We wish you the best with your health,
___ Medicine
