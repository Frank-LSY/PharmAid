aortic abnormality.
2. Extensive bilateral ___ opacities, micro- and macro- 
nodules,
bronchial wall thickening and consolidations concerning for an 
infectious
process, again concerning for mycobacterium. This has progressed 
since last
weeks exam suggesting active disease.
3. Mosaic attenuation of the lung parenchyma likely reflective 
of small
airways airways disease.

BRONCHIAL EMBOLIZATION (___): 
FINDINGS: 
 1. Main bronchial artery with bifurcation into left and right 
bronchial
arteries. Successful embolization to stasis with 300-500 micron 
particles.
2. No evidence of artery of ___.
 IMPRESSION: 
 Successful right common femoral artery access right and left 
bronchial artery
embolization to stasis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo ___ speaking woman who PMH of bronchiectasis presents 
with massive hemoptysis secondary to bronchiectasis. ___ 
performed bilateral bronchial artery embolization with 
resolution of patient's hemoptysis. CT findings revealed tree ___ 
___ findings suggestive of an infectious process. Patient was 
placed under airborne precautions, had positive AFBx3, which was 
sent to state lab for MTB direct amplification, which was 
negativex2 ruling out tuberculosis. Patient was stable for 
discharge with acapella teaching and followup appointments.

#Bronchiectasis: 
Suspect that patient's bronchiectasis is cause for her 
hemoptysis.  ___ 
performed bilateral bronchial artery embolization on ___ with 

no further episodes of hemoptysis during the hospitalization. 
Hemoglobin stable. Patient received PPSV23 and given cough 
suppressants and acapella teaching prior to discharge. Workup 
for bronchiectasis was started and will be followed up by 
pulmonology. 

#Mycobacteria
CT findings revealed tree ___ ___ findings, bronchiectasis, 
micro/macro nodules concerning for mycobacterium infection. 
Suspected that patient had nontuberculosis mycobacterium since 
patientÂ’s clinical presentation was not consistent with active 
TB.  Patient was 
placed under airborne precautions, had positive AFBx3, which was 

sent to state lab for MTB direct amplification, which was 
negative ruling out tuberculosis. Patient was discharged with 
follow up with pulmonology for treatment of NTM. Patient at high 
risk for resistance given she has been treated many times with 
antibiotics. 

#History of tachycardia: 
Patient was not tachycardic or complained of any palpitations 
during hospitalization. Was continued home propranolol  

#Hypertension
Was stable during hospitalization on home ramipril. On day of 
discharge, blood pressure was intermittently elevated with SBP 
___ 170's, but went back down after receiving morning dose of 
ramipril. 

# Thyroid nodules: 
Incidental finding of multinodular thyroid on CT scan. Recommend 
thyroid ultrasound outpatient

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===========================
[]repeat CBC at PCP follow up
[]f/u use of acapella
[]pt will need treatment for non-tuberculosis mycobacterium
[]thyroid nodules seen on CT scan. Consider thyroid ultrasound
[] follow up pending studies for bronchiectasis workup

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted because 
you were coughing up a lot of blood likely due to your 
bronchiectasis. Interventional radiology stabilized the bleeding 
arteries ___ your lung. Your blood count was stable and you had 
no further episodes of blood ___ your sputum. You were also put 
on tuberculosis precautions because your sputum was positive for 
acid-fast bacilli, which is a type of bacteria. We sent your 
sputum to test for tuberculosis and it was negative, so you were 
discharged with follow up appointments with your primary care 
doctor and the pulmonologist. Please continue to use the 
acapella valve as directed. Any coughing of blood, please come 
immediately to the emergency department or call ___.

We wish you the best,
Your ___ team
