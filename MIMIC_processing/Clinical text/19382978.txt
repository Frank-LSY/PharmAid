Radiology: ___
R shoulder xray: No fracture or dislocation.
R hand xray: 1.  No fracture. 
2. Osteoarthritis with degenerative changes involving the DIP
joints, CMC, and first MCP joint.  Findings at the distal
interphalangeal joints of all the fingers suggests possible
erosive osteoarthritis. 
3.  Osteopenia. 
L wrist xray: Partially corticated ossific density projecting at
base of fifth metacarpal is likely the portion of the hamate in 
a
slightly oblique view however this could represent a subtle
avulsion injury.  Correlation for focal tenderness is 
recommended. 
L femur xray: 1.  No fracture. 
2.  Progression of mild degenerative changes of left knee. 
MRI C spine: 1. Edema in the anterior aspect of the C4-5 disc 
and
minimal edema in the anterior longitudinal ligament at this
level, associated with C5 superior anterior corner fracture. 
C4-5 alignment is preserved. 
2. Edema in the anterior aspect of the C6-7 disc and posterior
aspect of the C7 superior endplate, as well as edema and 
possible
small focal disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament at
C6-7, associated with C6 anterior inferior corner fracture. 
Minimal retrolisthesis of C6 on C7 is slightly more 
conspicuous than on the CT from up approximately 12 hr earlier. 
3. Interspinous ligament edema from C1-C2 through C6-C7. 
4. Fracture of the T4 vertebral body and bilateral pedicles, 
with
mild loss of vertebral body height and associated buckling of 
the
posterior longitudinal ligament.  No evidence for posterior
ligamentous complex injury at this level. 
5. Multilevel degenerative disease.  The ventral spinal cord is
minimally remodeled at C3-4, but maintains normal signal. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p mechanical fall, + head strike, no LOC, with polytrauma, 
left maxillary sinus fractures, as well as fractures of the 
anterior corners of C4 and C6 vertebral bodies, hemodynamically 
stable with no neurological deficits. Evaluated by spine surgery 
with recommendations for MRI of C-spine to evaluate for 
ligamentous injury. Evaluated by Plastics and recommended sinus 
precautions, follow-up in clinic outpatient. The patient was 
admitted to the ACS service for pain management, physical 
therapy evaluation, and further work-up. Cervical MRI revealed 
interspinous ligament edema from C1-C2 through C6-C7. Spine 
recommended no acute surgical intervention and hard cervical 
collar at all times until follow-up in clinic. Tertiary survey 
revealed no other injuries. 

The patient worked with the Physical therapists, who recommended 
home with home ___. The patient's daughter was also going to be 
providing ___ help. At the time of discharge, the patient was 
doing well, afebrile and hemodynamically stable.   The patient 
was tolerating a diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, 
and pain was well controlled.  The patient received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan. She was 
discharged on a course of antibiotics for the UTI and will 
follow-up with her urologist.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
You were admitted to ___ after 
injuries sustained from a fall. You suffered facial fractures, 
and cervical vertebral fractures with associated ligamentous 
injuries. You were also found to have a urinary tract infection. 
You were seen by the Spine doctors and the Plastic surgeons. You 
will need to remain in the hard neck brace until your follow-up 
with the spine doctors. You should also follow-up with the 
Plastics team and your primary care provider. Physical Therapy 
worked with you and determined you were safe for discharge home 
with home ___. You are now ready for discharge. Please follow the 
instructions below to continue your recovery:

* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.

should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
