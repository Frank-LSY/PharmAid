Thoracic Spine w/o contrast Findings Vertebrae: multilevel 
confluent synostoses of the thoracic spine suggesting ankylosis. 
There is an acute thoracic spine fracture at the T8-9 level, 
which predominantly extends through the superior T9 vertebral 
body, although there is a small anterior inferior endplate 
fracture of T8. Fracture plane extends through the posterior 
elements bilaterally, with associated angulation and anterior 
widening at the T8-9 level compatible with unstable thoracic 
spine fracture. Adjacent increased soft tissue prominence and 
attenuation likely reflects associated paraspinal hematoma. 
Other bones: additional fracture extension through the posterior 
medial left 9th rib.
