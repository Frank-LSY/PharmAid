___ 06:52AM BLOOD Calcium-7.9* Phos-2.6*# Mg-2.___ with hypothyroidism who presented with severe sepsis after 
syncopizing at homeand syncope with vasovagal component, and 
improved on IV antibiotics and IV fluids.

# Severe Sepsis: Most likely due to urinary tract infection due 
to urinalysis results and Gram stain of urine, though 
community-acquired pneumonia and joint infection were on the 
differential as well. However, the patient's chest X-rays over 
two days was not consistent with a primary pulmonary process. 
Unlikely prosthetic joint infection given lack of symptoms and 
current clinical improvement. She was treated with ceftriaxone 
for urinary tract infection and empirically treated with 
azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia for two days 
during her workup. She defervesced and her clinical picture 
greatly improved on antibiotics. Her urine Gram stain showed 
>100K Gram-negative rods, consistent with urinary tract 
infection (despite her lack of urinary symptoms). Her antibiotic 
therapy for this was narrowed from IV ceftriaxone to PO 
ciprofloxacin. Azithromycin was discontinued due to low 
suspicion for pneumonia. 

# Acute Kidney Injury: The patient presented with mildly 
elevated renal function tests in the setting of sepsis. 
Hypotension suggested a prerenal etiology. Her BUN/Cre ~ 10 
suggested a component of intrinsic renal injury, but 
pyelonephritis was unlikely due to lack of costovertebral angle 
tenderness. 

# Syncope: The patient experienced likely vasovagal syncope in 
the setting of volume depletion given her recent hypotension and 
low volume status, as well as anemia, insomnia, and emotional 
distress. Low thyroid hormone can cause hypotension but while 
she did miss ___ few doses of levothyroxine recently, this should 
not have such a quick effect. Unlikely cardiogenic given normal 
rate/rhythm. Her orthostatic vital signs were reassuring. Her 
laboratory workup did reveal anemia which may be dealt with on 
an outpatient basis.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin and aspirin

# Hypothyroidism: Continued generic levothyroxine until the 
patient could bring her branded levothyroxine.

Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you. You were admitted for a fever

drastic improvement in your clinical condition, and are ready 
for discharge. Please finish your last doses of antibiotics 
tomorrow, ___. If you have any of the warning symptoms below,
