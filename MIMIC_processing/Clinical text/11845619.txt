Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD #1, patient was straight cathetherized x 1 due to urinary 
retention. He was voiding independently after.
POD #2, patient was given 500ml fluid bolus for soft blood 
pressures. Creatinine was 1.3. Toradol was discontinued. Repeat 
creatinine in the afternoon was 1.4 and patient was given 
additional 500ml fluid bolus. He was encouraged to increase PO 
fluid intake. Patient had a fever to 101 in the afternoon with 
tachycardia (HR 110s). A fever work-up was obtained. Urinalysis 
was negative. Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia. Blood 
cultures were pending at the time of discharge and patient will 
be contacted if further treatment is needed. 
POD #3, creatinine downtrended to 1.0.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Aspirin 81 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
Aquacel dressing remained clean and intact without erythema or 
abnormal drainage/saturation. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge, the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity. Please use walker or 2

taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily

daily with food for four (4) weeks to help prevent deep vein 
thrombosis (blood clots).  Continue Pantoprazole daily while on
