History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ RH M with complex, traumatic medical
history who is admitted for EEG long-term monitoring to
characterize intermittent spells occuring over the past ___
years. He was referred for monitoring by his psychiatrist Dr.
___, phone ___ and neurologist Dr.
___ at ___. 

History obtained from patient and Dr. ___ notes,
as well as pre-admit notes from ___ RN. He indicates a
number of head traumas over the years, in childhood and often
during periods of incarceration. Apparently in ___ he was hit 
on
the head with a blunt object and left bleeding and unconscious 
on
the floor of his prison cell for some time. He thinks there has
been significant difficulty since then. He has been legally 
blind
since birth, vision is ___ in right eye, and thinks R eye
vision has been worsening with each subsequent head trauma. He
also reports he was hit by a truck in ___, resulting in
significant low back injury, bilateral knee injuries, and
multiple orthopedic problems. 

Regarding his spells, he reports anywhere from ___ per day,
lasting for 45 seconds to a few minutes at most. He describes
multiple different types of episodes. Per Dr. ___:
"Sometimes he gets a warm sensation in all of his body and then
he can lose vision. Sometimes he sees various colors in his good
eye.  They are not typically associated with headaches, although
he does get
headaches intermittently.  Sometimes, he gets a sensation of
complete blackness and darkness.  Sometimes, he is hit with a
jolt of electricity.  This electricity goes throughout his body
and sometimes cannot come on the floor, although usually, he
remains standing or sitting during these episodes.  He believes
he is awake and aware of what is going on around him.  He
describes a sensation of being paralyzed, like he cannot move. 
He believes that one time this happened while in the middle of a
street and he almost was struck by a car.  He has not had
episodes associated with abnormal motor movements that he is
aware of.  No tongue biting, no urinary incontinence.  He
sometimes has tinnitus during these episodes.  He does not think
they have significantly changed in the last 15 or ___ years, but
he is very concerned that the head injury in ___ may have made
them worse, although he has not noticed any change in frequency,
so I am not completely sure what the concern is here.  He is not
aware of any particular loss time, although he does sometimes
feel like there is a sensation that he is out of time or is
zoning out when this occurs.  On the rest of the interview, he
does believe that he has had out-of-body experiences in the 
past,
particularly while he is imprisoned.  No ___ or ___. 
He has no olfactory or gustatory hallucinations.  No OCD-like
tendencies.  When asked about hallucinations, he did, however,
report that he does at times have auditory hallucinations.  He
indicated that at some point while he was incarcerated, someone
around him either committed suicide or died and since that point
he has been plagued by demonic activity of some sort. 
Apparently, the person who lives below him apparently made some
spiritual attacks and tried to injure him in some way.  Now, 
when
he gets agitated, he often hears voices tormenting him and
provoking him to act out.  He finds his voices are sometimes
graphic.  He occasionally has visual images, although he was a
little vague about these.  He indicates that images are usually
quite graphic and sadistic about torture and injury by fire." 

Pt was evaluated at ___ by 2 neurologists and has had several
studies including a sleep study, which showed some mild sleep
apnea and some mild periodic leg movements, but nothing which
explained his events during the day. Later he was found to have
iron deficiency anemia. He had an MRI and a CT scan, which 
showed
some left temporal and parietal T2 hyperintensities and
encephalomalacia, which was felt to be either secondary to old
trauma or perhaps infarction, although it was unclear. He also
had a routine EEG, which was normal. 

Regarding birth history, he does not know details, but he was
told that there may have been some injury and he might be on the
mental retardation spectrum.

Patient is followed by Dr. ___ for various
psychiatric problems including borderline intellectual
disability, impulse control disorder, and "personality disorde
related to cognitive function and psychosocial issues". She
tapered him off Valium and asked him to stop taking the Soma 
that
was being used for pain until we could "see what was going on
neurologically". The patient himself feels that his mood and
behavior have been under fairly good control, not aggressive
right now. However he is worried about getting aggressive/losing
control in the hospital, and psychiatry has stated that he
responds well to limit setting. They strongly recommend
Psychiatry consult on admission to help with management.

EPILEPSY/NES RISK FACTORS AND COURSE: 
1. Head trauma as child- pt recalls playing on swing when young,
fell about "100 to 150ft" in air and hit head on ground. Not
evaluated to treated. He reports living at ___ at the
time.
2. Childhood seizures: Pt thinks he may have had some episodes 
of
shaking after the trauma noted above as a child, but never told

in
"illegal restraints", "isolated in dark rooms without food or
water". 
4. H/O injuries when incarcerated intermittently over ___ year
period, allegedly out of jail since ___. He relates episode in
___ when people came into his cell and assaulted him, he
awoke in "pool of blood with eye bleeding and swollen". He

to a different prison after this and reports more physical 
abuse.
5. Pt believes seizures or events have gradually worsened since
he has been out of prison. 
6. Irregular lifestyle, sleep deprivation, extreme caffeine
intake since out of ___, lives in homeless shelters.

- cEEG (___): This continuous video EEG captured two pushbutton 
activations. One was inadvertent. The second appears to have 
been purposeful, but there is no change from background 
telemetry. On video, the patient is eating and activates the 
button. There is no outward clinical correlate. Automated and 
routine sampling otherwise demonstrated a normal-appearing 
background alpha rhythm. There were no epileptiform features 
seen. 

- cEEG (___): This continuous video EEG captured multiple 
pushbutton 
activations generally for electrical type sensations down the 
leg. There were no electrographic correlates to any of these 
spells. Automated and routine sampling otherwise demonstrated a 
normal-appearing background mixed frequency rhythm. There were 
no epileptiform features seen. 

- cEEG (___): ***PENDING***

- cEEG (___): This continuous video EEG captured several 
pushbutton activations with no electrographic correlate. 
Automated and routine sampling otherwise demonstrated a 
normal-appearing background mixed frequency rhythm. There were 
no epileptiform features seen. 
  
- cEEG (___): This continuous video EEG captured a couple of 
inadvertent 
pushbutton activations. There were no electrographic seizures 
seen. Automated and routine sampling otherwise demonstrated a 
normal-appearing background mixed frequency rhythm. There were 
no epileptiform features seen. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ RH M with complex history including physical and 
emotional trauma, head injuries, impulse control disorder, 
borderline intellectual function and history of incarceration 
for sexual offense who is being admitted for EEG
long-term monitoring to characterize a ___ year history of 
abnormal spells. Plan is to keep him on EEG for 7 days and 
hopefully capture some events. 

# NEURO: Pt was electively admitted to Epilepsy service where he 
underwent 5 days of EEG long-term monitoring. During this time 
there were multiple pushbuttons for various symptoms (especially 
'electric shock' sensation in legs), all of which showed no 
epileptiform or seizure correlate on EEG. There was a normal 
background EEG rhythm throughout. Final diagnosis on discharge 
was non-epileptic events. He was discharged from the hospital 
after 5 days of monitoring. He initially refused to leave the 
hospital as he did not want to be discharged "to the street"; 
despite multiple attempts to help with transportation to his 
shelter and discussion of other options with case mgmt and 
social work, he refused all efforts. 

# PSYCH: Per outpatient psychiatrist recommendations, Psychiatry 
was consulted upon his admission to the hospital. Their 
impression was of a personality disorder with histrionic and 
antisocial features. They felt he carried low actual risk for 
violence though he talked of fears of losing control. They also 
noted suspicion for somatic symptom disorder, and that in 
absence of EEG confirmation of epileptiform activity, it is 
likely that his report of "spells" falls in this category. They 
also felt that his bedside exam was not suggestive of 
significant cognitive impairment. 

# HEME: Due to report of some restless leg symptoms during night 
time, a serum iron and ferritin were checked. Both of these were 
fairly low (normal CBC). Team wanted to start iron supplements, 
but patient refused due to unclear history of sulfa allergy. He 
was advised to discuss this with his PCP on discharge to 
possibly start an iron supplement that does not contain sulfa 
(not available on ___ formulary).

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital to look for seizure activity 
as a cause for multiple symptoms. We monitored you on EEG, and 
you had several different kinds of events. There was no 
correlation on your EEG, meaning that these events were not 
seizures. We did some imaging of your back, as you were 
describing radiating pain down your legs. We did not find any 
obvious cause for your pain, but your primary care doctor ___ 
follow up with you regarding the final read.

Your iron was slightly low here. We will communicate this to 
your primary care doctor so that you can be treated with a 
non-sulfate medication which we do not carry in the hospital 
here.

We have made no changes to your medications.
