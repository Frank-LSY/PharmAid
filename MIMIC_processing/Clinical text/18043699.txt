She arrived on ___ and spent 2 days with ___. However, at
dinner this evening, ___ told the patient that she was seeing
someone else. This resulted in patient crying and being unable 
to
console. She was outside on a balcony, and reported thoughts 
such
as "if I jump off this balcony, everything would be fine." She
stated she was too afraid to do it, but she felt that life was
not worth living and that "life is sad." Since ___ knew that
patient had past history of suicidal thoughts, she was worried 
by
her statements and called the ambulance who brought the patient
to the ED. 

In ED, patient continues to endorse SI because she still
feels sad, but denies current plan. Denies feeling safe because
she "does not know what [she] would to do herself." However, she
does think she could tell ED staff if she has unsafe thoughts.
She explains that she does not want to die, but sometimes her
"brain tells [her] what to do." She feels that it's almost
"addictive to drown [herself] in sadness." Denies HI. 

Patient explains that though she was diagnosed with depression,
she feels that she just "loses control of [herself]." Patient
states that she will have thoughts of hurting herself once every
6 months and it will only occur in the context of a relationship
issue or when someone "breaks [her] heart." In those moments, 
she
reports becoming "desperate" and feels that nothing is worth
living for. Prior to this, she last had thoughts of suicide 6
months had, but could not recall the details. She stated that it
stated "something happened in the context of breaking up with 
her
ex" and she thinks she cut herself with glass after breaking a
light bulb. She states she will engaged in SIB with superficial
cutting. She will only cut her L wrist, but this time with the
light bulb left a scar. She has also tried hanging herself in 
the
past, but denies any intent of dying. She will engaged in SIB or
have thoughts of SI because she "wants to torture herself" but
denies previous suicide attempts. 

Patient endorsing depressed mood, anhedonia, decreased appetite,
increased difficult with sleep (difficulty falling asleep and
will often up in the middle of the night and have difficulty
falling back asleep), restlessness, fatigue/loss of energy,
worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness, and recurrent thoughts of
death

Upon interview today on Deac 4, patient states that staying in
the hospital alone has been difficult because she feels lonely.
She no longer endorsing SI and last reports SI last night. When
asked what changed, she states that when she feels that someone
cares about her, it makes her feel "really good." Since last
night, she spoke with her sister on the phone who was 
supportive.
She also stated that she had a kind nurse in the ER who she felt
was nice and caring. And, the girl (___) who she met on the
dating application came to visit her, which made her feel
"happy." Hoping to see more of ___, who was waiting outside 
of
Deac 4 during exam. Denies SI/HI/AVH. Reports that feels safe on
Deac 4 and is comfortable telling staff if she has unsafe
thoughts.

States she no longer feels depressed, "just lonely." Continues 
to
endorse decreased appetite, and decreased sleep (difficulty
falling asleep last night, slept 3 hours overnight). States that
her fatigue/loss of energy, worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness,
and recurrent thoughts of death have improved. She states that
she is hoping to think of the "positive side of things now." 

While on Deac 4, she thinks speaking with someone who is a
___ may be helpful, but feels that talking to friends
will be more helpful. Her goal of being here is to avoid having
