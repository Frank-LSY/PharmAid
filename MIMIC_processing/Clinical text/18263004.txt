2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Although patient's initial presentation appeared consistent 
with a worsening depressive episode, collateral from patient's 
psychiatrist and family (i.e. two-year period of acute change in 
personality, non-specific cognitive decline, increasing paranoia 
including thoughts of others being out to get him, and 
heightened preoccupation about his sexual preferences) broadened 
the differerntial for current presentation to include major 
depressive disorder with psychotic features versus an 
unspecified primary psychotic disorder. Of note, patient has a 
maternal aunt with schizophrenia. Substance induced psychosis 
was also considered, given patient's history of heavy marijuana 
use; however, patient had been sober from any substance use

appeared significantly preoccupied and intrusive thoughts of 
others leading him, thinking he is a "weirdo", and concerns 
about his sexuality. He also endorsed feelings of shame, 
hopelessness, worthlessness, and guilt. He exhibited depressed, 
but somewhat guarded/distant, affect on exam. Initially patient 
was on Zyprexa 5 mg nightly at admission; however, patient 
reported increased daytime somnolence and had limited 
improvement in other symptoms since initiating this medication 
as an outpatient. Patient was transitioned to Abilify on

Patient denied any significant side effects of this medication 
and overall tolerated this medication well. Following initiation 
and titration of Abilify, patient reported gradual improvement 
in symptoms of depression; he also noted a gradual decrease in 
his anxiety/preoccupation with others' perceptions of him. He 
was noted to be significantly less isolative.At discharge, 
patient noted improved mood, was more socially engaged and less 
isolative, with some lingering thoughts about others' 
perceptions of him, but also with improvement in reality 
testing. He denied any current suicidal ideation or 
thoughts/urges to engage in self-harm or harm of others.
