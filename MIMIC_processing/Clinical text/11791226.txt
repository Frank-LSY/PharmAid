Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Dr. ___ service with 
nephrolithiasis and acute kidney injury and was taken to the OR 
after observation in the ED. He underwent urgent cystoscopy, 
bladder neck contracture dilation, left retrograde pyelogram, 
left double-J ureteral stent placement. Although he tolerated 
the procedure well there was intraoperative finding of cloudy 
urine and debris emanating from left ureter after stent 
placement. Mr. ___ also had a dense bladder neck contracture 
that had to be dilated to 20fr to accommodate the ___ scope. 
Given the concerning urine and possibility of incontinence, he 
was admitted for observation, repeat labs, leak trial.  See the 
dictated operative note for full details. Overnight, he was 
hydrated with intravenous fluids and received appropriate 
perioperative prophylactic antibiotics. On POD1, catheter was 
removed and post void residuals checked. At discharge on POD1, 
patientÂ’s pain was controlled with oral pain medications, 
tolerating regular diet, ambulating without assistance, and 
voiding without difficulty.  He was explicitly advised to follow 
up as directed as the indwelling ureteral stent must be removed 
and or exchanged, to continue his antibiotics and to pursue 
definitive management with his urologist.

Discharge Instructions:
You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to 
possibly experience some urgency and frequency over the next 
month;  this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or 
the indwelling ureteral stent.

-The kidney stone HAS NOT BEEN treated/removed.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter.; This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed. 

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) 

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

control, try TYLENOL FIRST, then ibuprofen, and then take the

is needed.

taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your
