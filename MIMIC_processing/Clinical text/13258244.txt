*** UNAPPROVED (PRELIMINARY) REPORT *** !! WET READ !!  
EXAMINATION: LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) 
  
INDICATION: History: ___ with abnormal LFTs, epigastric/flank 
pain, report of 
hematuria. // eval obstruction, hydronephrosis 
  
TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the 
abdomen were 
obtained. 
  
COMPARISON: None. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
LIVER: The liver is diffusely echogenic. The contour of the 
liver is smooth.  
There is a focal hypoechoic area near the hepatic hilum which is 
likely a 
focal fatty sparing.. The main portal vein is patent with 
hepatopetal flow.  
There is no ascites. 
  
BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CHD 
measures 9 mm. 
  
GALLBLADDER: The patient is status post cholecystectomy. 
  
PANCREAS: The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within 
normal limits, 
without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of 
the pancreatic 
tail obscured by overlying bowel gas. 
  
SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 11.5 cm. 
  
KIDNEYS: The right kidney measures 11.1 cm. The left kidney 
measures 12.6 cm. 
Normal cortical echogenicity and corticomedullary 
differentiation is seen 
bilaterally. There is no evidence of masses, stones, or 
hydronephrosis in the 
kidneys. 
  
RETROPERITONEUM: The visualized portions of aorta and IVC are 
within normal 
limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. There is mild dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts and the 
common bile duct. 
Patient is post cholecystectomy. 
2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease and 
more advanced liver disease including steatohepatitis or 
significant hepatic 
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study. 

Findings: 
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal 
 
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal 
 
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal 
 
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla 

Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and 
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast 
medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.  
 

Fluoroscopic interpretation. Biliary Tree: A single 4 mm round 
stone that was causing partial obstruction was seen at the lower 
third of the common bile duct. There was post-obstructive 
dilation. There was mild dilation of the CHD, and intrahepatics, 
which were all well visualized. The cystic duct did not opacify. 
I supervised the acquisition and interpretation of the 
fluoroscopic images. The quality of the images was good.  

Pancreas: Partial opacification of the PD was normal  

Procedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock 
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
The stone, along with a small amount of sludge, was extracted 
successfully using a balloon.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the random 
stomach (rule out H.pylori, at referring team request).  
 

Impression: Successful biliary cannulation was achieved with 
the sphincterotome
A single 4 mm round stone that was causing partial obstruction 
was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct. There was 
post-obstructive dilation. There was mild dilation of the CHD, 
and intrahepatics, which were all well visualized. The cystic 
duct did not opacify.
Successful biliary sphincterotomy was performed.
The stone, along with a small amount of sludge, was extracted 
successfully using a balloon.
Completion cholangiogram was normal
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 
stomach (rule out H.pylori, at referring team request).  
Otherwise normal ERCP to ___ part of duodenum
 

Recommendations: NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration 
with LR at 200 cc/hr
If no abdominal pain in the AM, advance diet to clear liquids 
and then advance as tolerated.
No aspirin, plavix, NSAIDS, coumadin for 5 days
Follow-up biopsy results
