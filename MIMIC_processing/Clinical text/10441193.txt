=============================================
Pt was admitted to ___. E on ___ for hematuria, underwent
cystoscopy on ___ that revealed "diffuse clotting." Per St E
records, "cystoscopy was challenging bc of ongoing bleeding
likely from the prostate which is significantly enlarged and
irregular...decision was made to conclude the procedure and use
gentle traction with catheter to tamponade the prostate and 
start
pt on finasteride." In the PACU, pt was in acute hypercapnic
respiratory failure due to oversedation (received 2mg dilaudid,
3mg Haldol and precede gtt ___ procedure) and was subsequently
admitted to MICU for BiPAP. He improved and hematuria resolved 
at
time of discharge (he was weaned off of CBI by Urology), and
discharged on finasteride 5mg qd and oxybutynin 5mg tid. Course
was also c/b SVT which resolved after receiving IVF and IV
Lopressor, as well as fever which was attributed to UTI vs.
aspiration pneumonitis (completed 7-day course). Additionally,
found to have 2.5cm hypodense lesion in medial aspect of
pancreatic head on ___ CT abd/pelvis. CT abd/pelvis also notable
moderate enlargement of prostate gland w/ significant impression
at bladder base. Discharge Hgb: 8.9 

Since discharge, he has not experienced any additional 
hematuria,
foley was removed last ___ by his urologist in
clinic. He was cleared by urology, cleared by ___ last week. 
Since
that time, he had been voiding clear yellow urine without
difficulty. He saw his PCP on ___ - at this time, PCP was
concerned about Hgb 8.1/Hct 26 and felt this was low, given his
age. Prior to this, PCP says his ___ was 12.4 in ___. PCP says
___ drawn on ___ was 7.8, at which time RN told pt to
report to ED for blood transfusion. Re: his pancreatic mass, PCP
says he was scheduled to get outpatient MRCP today. 

___ ED Course
===============
In the ED initial VS were 98.4 92 145/79 18 100% RA. Exam was
notable for brown, guaiac negative stool. Basic labs were
obtained and were notable for Hgb 7.6, which is down from Hgb 
8.9
on discharge from ___ on ___. Repeat Hgb was
obtained prior to admission to the floor and was 8.4. He 
received
1U pRBC in ED. 

Urology was consulted and recommended:  
"-bladder scan to ensure emptying, if voiding without clots then
leave without catheter.  
-If he develops clots or if PVR >250cc, then replace catheter
(can page urology for that). 
-If crit continues to drop and/or he develops gross hematuria,
page urology and CT scan  
-Admit to medicine, follow up with urology in the AM".

PATIENT SUMMARY:
==================
Mr. ___ is a ___ y.o. M with hematuria, BPH, HTN c/b
subacute L. frontoparietal stroke, extensive small vessel
disease, and suspected amyloid angiopathy, who is was referred
from his PCP for anemia ___ cystoscopy at ___ that was
c/b acute hypercapnic resp failure from over-sedation. He
received 1U pRBC in ED and Hgb has been stable ___ since 
presenting; asymptomatic.

ACUTE ISSUES:  
=============  
#Iron Deficiency Anemia 
Referred to ED from PCP office for ___ 8.1 (___), given 
age and drop from last discharge at ___ with Hgb 8.9 
(___). ___ ED Hgb 7.6, improved to ___ ___ 1U pRBC in 
ED. Stool guaiac negative in ED, pt denied any sx of hematuria, 
hematochezia or melena. Hgb at discharge was : 8.3. While recent 
hematuria undoubtedly contributed to recent drop in Hct, it is 
unclear what underlying etiology of chronic anemia is. He was 
noted to be iron deficient and also to have inappropriate 
reticulocyte count suggesting possible component of marrow 
suppression. No evidence of hemolysis with normal haptoglobin, 
LDH, smear (normal after repeated on blood prior to 
transfusion).

#Asymptomatic bacteriuria
ED urine culture ___ grew ENTEROCOCCUS SP. (10,000-100,000 
CFU/mL). Patient was asymptomatic with no dysuria, no frequency, 
no symptoms of urinary retention or reports of suprapubic 
discomfort. Not treated given asymptomatic.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
===============
# Hematuria
Pt did not present with any sx of urinary retention or hematuria 
at discharge. About ~5 days prior to presentation, foley 
catheter was removed in clinic (initially placed during last 
inpatient hospitalization). Q6 hour bladder scans inpatient 
revealed no post void residuals, no urinary retention. He was 
seen by Urology in ED, who recommended no intervention at this 
time given that he was asx. He was continued on home 
finasteride. Oxybutinin discontinued as no bladder spasms in the 
setting of recent foley catheter discontinuation. 

#HTN
BP 141/71 on admission. Previously on amlodipine, but this was 
stopped by pt prior to ___ hospitalization and never 
re-started. Per PCP, pt should restart this medication; however, 
daughter says this was never refilled. Amlodipine 5mg was 
restarted at discharge. 

#Pancreatic Mass
At last ___ hospitalization, pt was found to have 
2.5cm
hypodense lesion in medial aspect of pancreatic head on ___ CT
abd/pelvis. He will need further outpatient imaging to 
characterize this mass.
