Admission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___
 
Date of Birth:  ___             Sex:   F
 
Service: SURGERY
 
Allergies: 
scallops
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
distal pancreatic cyst
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
robot assisted distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy

 
History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a healthy ___ woman with a cystic 
neoplasm of the pancreatic tail.  She has undergone endoscopic 
ultrasound demonstrating a 3.2 cm simple cystic lesion in the 
tail of the pancreas without associated masses, mural 
nodularity, or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  Fine-needle 
aspirates demonstrated a cyst fluid CEA of 2147.  She has not 
had MRI or MRCP to delineate a potential communication to the 
main pancreatic duct.  Her CT scans, however, demonstrate a 
single cystic lesion which abuts the major splenic artery and 
vein effectively within the hilum of the spleen.  The remainder 
of the pancreas appears normal.

Mrs. ___ was presented in our multidisciplinary pancreatic 
or biliary management conference.  Given the size of the lesion, 
and the likelihood of a mucinous origin, the group 
recommendation was minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and 
splenectomy. This management strategy avoids the mean for 
long-term surveillance and minimizes the chance of missing a 
mucinous cystic neoplasm.  Conversely, surgical intervention for 
a side-branch I PMN, the alternate diagnosis, is not clearly 
indicated in the absence of high risk features.

 
Past Medical History:
Her past medical / surgical history includes hypothyroidism,
vaginal atrophy, caesarian section, right knee arthroplasty,
cataract surgery, multiple colonoscopies with polypectomies,
salivary gland surgery.
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
Her family history is significant for an aunt with ovarian 
cancer
with unknown primary, father with emphysema, and sister with
vascular disease.
 
Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS: AVSS, See flowsheets
GEN: No distress, pleasant, conversant
HEENT:  Sclera non-icteric, neck is supple without 
lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly or JVD
HEART:  RRR with no murmurs
LUNGS:  No increased work of breathing, clear to auscultation 
bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes
ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, no rebound or guarding
EXTREMITIES: Warm, well perfused, no edema

___ on ___. The patient was taken to 
the OR and underwent a robot-assisted minimally-invasive distal 
pancreatectomy and splenectomy. For details of the procedure, 
please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient tolerated 
the procedure well without complications and was brought to the 
post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. After a brief 
stay, the patient was transferred to the vascular surgery floor 
where she remained through the rest of the hospitalization.

Post-operatively, she did recovered well. Her diet was slowly 
advanced and her pain medication regimen was modified according

without assistance, void without issues, and pain was controlled 
on oral medications alone. She was deemed ready for discharge, 
and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at the ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
your distal pancreatic cyst. You had a robot assisted distal 
pancreatectomy and splenectomy on ___. You tolerated the 
procedure well and have recovered well from some mild 
post-operative issues, that resolved prior to your discharge. 
You are now ambulating, stooling, tolerating a regular diet, and 

your pain is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are 
now ready to be discharged to home. Please follow the 
recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 

otherwise.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 

such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 

to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

Additional: 
*- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back
*- urinary:  burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
-You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering 
your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off.  Do 
not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 

opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. 

JP Drain Care:
