History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old F w/ hx of MGUS, fibromyalgia, and
GERD who was referred to the ED for concern for finger necrosis.
Two weeks ago, she noticed an area of redness on her L finger.
She was seen by a dermatologist who took a biopsy; cultures were
negative. She then went to ___ to see family, but presented
to an ED there due to worsening pain and swelling of her L index
finger. There, they suspected herpetic whitlow and prescribed 
her
acyclovir, which she took for three days. However, over the last
2 days she has noted rapidly progressive erythema, white 
plaques,
and swelling over the left index finger. It has been exquisitely
painful and she also has since developed two new spots on her R
index finger, which were similar to how her L finger developed.
She also endorses pain with swallowing and red dots on the roof
of her mouth. She has a history of oral HSV, but has not had any
flares in one year. She denies a history of Zoster or rashes on
her back or feet. She had one episode of diarrhea. Denies 
fevers,
chills, or night sweats. She was seen by her Dermatologist this
AM who referred her in for further workup. 

In the ED, vitals were unremarkable for fevers or hemodynamic
instability. Exam showed L finger erythema from the MCP to 
distal
phalynx and R finger with two small areas of erythema.
Dermatology was consulted who took a culture in the ED and
recommended starting IV antibiotics and high dose steroids. Hand
Surgery was consulted who also recommended antiviral therapy.
Hand x-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis or soft tissue
gas. She was given IV vanc, ceftriaxone, and 50 mg
methylprednisolone IV. 

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports her hand pain is
improving, although still very tender. She also continues to 
have
some tender submandibular lymphadenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old F w/ hx of MGUS, fibromyalgia, and 
GERD presenting with acute, bilateral painful lesions on index 
fingers, thought to be secondary to an atypical presentation of 
a neutrophilic dermatosis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[] Discharged on 40mg prednisone daily for 7 days (last dose 
___.
[] Bactrim DS 2 tabs BID x 7 days (last dose ___.
[] Consider Chem-7 at PCP follow up given discharged on Bactrim.
[] Final pathology pending at discharge.
[] ___ positive, titer pending at discharge, rheumatology to 
follow up as outpatient if titer is > 340.
[] UPEP and CCP pending at discharge.
[] She was trained by OT on a ROM HEP that she will start 
performing 3x/day. I would anticipate progression back to a full 
composite and hook fist in ___ weeks. 
[] She needs hepatitis B vaccination (hep B non-immune).

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============
# Bilateral hand lesions
# Atypical presentation of a neutrophilic dermatosis
Presented with rapidly progressive painful hand lesions with 
epidermolysis and desquamation. Improved rapidly on IV 
vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir/methylpred. Transitioned to PO 
prednisone 40mg daily and Bactrim DS BID and tolerated this well 
prior to discharge. Dermatology, rheumatology, and hand surgery 
were consulted. Also seen by OT and was trained on a ROM HEP 
that she will start performing 3x/day with anticipate 
progression back to a full composite and hook fist in ___ weeks. 

Preliminary outpatient biopsy result from outpatient dermatology 
note below. Per dermatology, likely atypical Sweet's syndrome. 
Several studies sent, detailed below:
- ___ positive, titer pending, rheumatology to follow up on this 
and contact patient if needed.
- SPEP negative, Free K/L normal, UPEP pending
- Hepatitis B non-immune, HCV negative, HIV negative
- ANCA negative, RA negative
- CCP pending at discharge
- Wound cultures negative
- Blood cultures NGTD at discharge
- Punch Bx (___) left index finger (Prelim): Neutrophilic 
infiltrate with fibrin thrombi, c/w Sweets +/- vasculitis. 
?Pustular vasculitis of the hands. Bug stains are negative. 
Wound cx (___) Final, no growth.

# Palatal petechiae
# Cervical lymphadenopathy
Initially, concerning for cocksackivirus related to skin 
lesions, but did not self-resolve. Likely viral in etiology. 
Consider further work up if persists after discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Vitamin D deficiency - Held vitamin D and calcium while 
hospitalized
# HLD - Held coQ10 and fish oil while hospitalized
# Chronic pain - Continued home gabapentin
# Rosacea - Held prn metronidazole given no active flare
# Intertrigo, bilateral breasts - Continued home nystatin BID

Greater than 30minutes spent on discharge planning and 
cordination.
