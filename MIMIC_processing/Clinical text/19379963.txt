====================
ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================

# Syncope
Patient presented with two episodes of syncope on the morning of 
admission. No prodromal or postictal symptoms, but was 
associated with loss of consciousness of unknown duration. 
Second episode also notable for laceration of nose. In the ED, 
found to be hypotensive to the ___, responsive to IV fluids. 
Found to be influenza A positive. CXR with right lower lobe 
opacity, concerning for underlying pneumonia. Most likely 
etiology for syncope was hypovolemia and orthostasis in the 
setting of influenza/CAP. There was low concern for cardiac 
etiology as EKG in ED non-revealing, no history of arrhythmia or 
structural heart disease, and telemetry unremarkable throughout 
hospital stay. History was also not consistent with a seizure 
episode. 

# Influenza A
# Community-acquired pneumonia
Patient presented with a two to three day history of cough and 
myalgia. Found to be influenza A positive. CXR demonstrated 
subtle RLL opacity, concerning for pneumonia. Although symptoms 
onset possibly >72 hours, patient was started on oseltamivir, 
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in ED, before transitioning to 
levofloxacin for CAP management. Symptoms improved throughout 
admission, and patient remained afebrile. Will be discharged to 
complete a five day course of levofloxacin and oseltamivir.

# ___
Baseline creatinine unclear. On presentation to ED, creatinine 
elevated to 1.5. This was felt likely pre-renal in etiology, in 
the setting of hypovolemia secondary to infection. Received IVF 
in the ED, with improvement in creatinine to 1.1. 

# Nasal laceration
Patient sustained complex nasal laceration following second 
syncope episode. Reviewed by plastic surgery in the ED, who 
cleaned wound and placed sutures. Bacitracin was applied twice 
daily to prevent wound infection. Patient should continue 
Bacitracin for an additional day post discharge, and then apply 
Vaseline daily while sutures remain in place. Plastic surgery 
will see patient in their clinic for suture removal within seven 
days of discharge. Patient has been given instructions in how to 
make this appointment.

======================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================

# Hypertension
Lisinopril, HCTZ and spironolactone were held during admission, 
initially in the setting of hypotension, and subsequently 
normotension. These will be held at discharge, and decision 
if/when to restart is deferred to outpatient providers.

# Type II diabetes mellitus
Home metformin was held. Patient refused insulin sliding scale. 
Blood glucose levels remained stable without treatment.

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

- discharge Creatinine: 1.1

additional day of bacitracin and then vaseline/petroleum jelly 
until suture removal
[] Any questions regarding return to work should be directed to 
employee health

diff should be repeated at next PCP appointment to ensure 
resolution
