had family meeting to address social stressors.  She 
demonstrated significant improvement of her symptoms with no 
reported suicidal ideation. She was encouraged to attend groups 
on the unit.  Patient was also set up with outpatient 
psychiatry/therapy provider at ___ - 
___.
 
#) Protective Factors:
- Help-seeking behavior
- Lack of past suicide attempts
- Future-oriented
- Motivated to continue treatment
- No passive SI reported 
- No sense of hopelessness
- No history of substance use
- Strong family support
 
PROGNOSIS:
Good with outpatient follow up and continued work on family 
relationships, future goals, and self affirmation.  Ms. 
___ presented with persistent depressive 
disorder/dysthymia that caused significant psychosocial 
interference, personal distress, and led to a suicide attempt.  
While at ___, she started individual and group psychotherapy 
and 10mg of Celexa daily. She no longer reports suicidal 
ideation and expresses interest in seeing an outpatient 
therapist and psychiatrist and working with her mother on their 
relationship.  She was involved in groups during her 
hospitalization and was open using coping strategies.  In 
particular, she enjoyed writing an essay in one of the groups.  
My prognosis for Ms. ___ is that she has the potential to 
do very well as an outpatient.  She is  motivated to continue to 
seek further treatment because she feels close to her family 
members and would not want to hurt them by hurting 
herself/ending her life.  She has strong relationships with her 
grandmother, who she visits and helps with groceries, as well as 
her mother and father.  There are still some concerns that she 
is not focusing on herself or her own activities as primary 
motivators as well.  We discussed goal-oriented thinking and she 
laid out a few goals for the next few weeks to months, including 
getting out of the house more and losing weight.  While she does 
not mention any long-term goals for the next several years, this 
is an improvement from her initial presentation.  Additionally, 
this will be further addressed by meeting with outpatient 
psychiatrist and therapist.  She has been taught about the 
warning signs and understands that there are many resources, 
including the emergency department that she can follow-up with.
