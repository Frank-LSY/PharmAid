ACUTE ISSUE ADDRESSED

# Altered Mental Status
The cause of the patient's altered mental status is believed to 
be unintentional substance intoxication (most likely marijuana). 
The patient was given a brownie from a client a few hours prior 
to the onset of his symptoms. The patient was unsure of its 
contents and believes it could have contained an intoxicant like 
marijuana. The patient denies ever intentionally using marijuana 
and did not know the symptoms of marijuana intoxication. 
Toxicology screen was performed but did not include marijuana. 
Initially, the team was concerned for meningitis. Antibiotics 
(ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and acyclovir were initially on 
board. After ___ guided LP on (___) was unremarkable and 
information regarding likely toxic ingestion with symptoms 
starting immediately following became available, antibiotics and 
acyclovir were discontinued. Patient's symptoms had all resolved 
at time of discharge.  

#Social stressors
Patient lives in family shelter with his wife and 3 children and 
is very stressed about providing for his family. He was seen by 
psychiatry to rule out intentional ingestion and there was no 
concern for suicidal ideation. He was also seen by social work 
who provided him with resources for clothing for his children. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# HTN
Given unsure etiology of patient's AMS and the fact that the 
patient was never hypertensive while in the hospital, home 
lisinopril-HCTZ was held while in-house and restarted on 
discharge.

# DM
Metformin and glimepiride were held while in-house and patient 
placed on an insulin sliding scale. His home medications were 
resumed on discharge.

# HLD
Gemfibrozil was held while in-house and resumed at discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] patient is living in a shelter with his family and has 
applied for housing. He was provided with resources for shoes 
and clothing for his children. 
[] patient with mild anemia on presentation likely secondary to 
fluids and phlebotomy, iron studies normal.
[] patient stressed about providing for his family and may be 
affecting mood, does not meet criteria for SI or depression at 
this time, please continue to monitor. 
[] please follow up final results blood cultures that are 
pending, no growth 72 hours and very low suspicion for 
bacteremia.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure to have taken care of you at ___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED?
Your co-workers noticed that you were acting strangely and were 
concerned about you. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS HERE?
You were first seen at ___ and transferred 
here. We were initially worried that you could have an infection 
of the lining of your spinal cord and brain called meningitis. 
We started you on various medications and obtained fluid from 
around your spinal cord. The fluid was reassuring that you 
didn't have an infection, so we stopped the antibiotics. After 
talking with you, we learned that you were given a brownie from 
a client of yours. We believe the brownie contained a substance 
(like marijuana) that could have caused your symptoms.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE?
- Continue to take your medications as prescribed.
- Please make a follow up appointment with your primary care 
doctor within 4 weeks of discharge.

We wish you the best of health,
Your ___ Medicine Team
