overeating). Prior to admission, she had been taking Celexa 10mg 
as an outpatient for about a year. She said that initially she 
felt like it was helping but she no longer felt that way 
anymore.  Given her ongoing symptoms of depression, the team and

augmentation of her Celexa with Wellbutrin to provide 
synergystic benefits.  She was started on Wellbutrin 75mg. She 
tolerated the medication well and denied any side effects.
