History of Present Illness:
HPI:
___ with hx of thyroid problem and HTN here with around 1 month
of gradual onset right eye erythema, burning, itching, and
dysconjugate gaze. 

The patient speaks ___, dialect of ___, and does not
understand ___ even though it is listed as preferred
language. History obtained from patient's niece (wife's sister's
daughter) who speaks both ___ but has
limited knowledge of medical terminology. Tomorrow, the 
patient's
brother-in-law who speaks both ___ and ___ in 
addition
to ___ be with the patient. Hopefully this yields a
more complete history. 

Pt has noticed gradual onset of initial redness, itching, and
intermittent burning in his right eye over one month. Shortly
after the redness started, his son noticed gradual onset of
dysconjugate gaze. The patient denies noticing any dysconjugate
gaze when looking in the mirror. In fact, he only notes one
episode of diplopia in the last month around 10 days ago when he
had several minutes of horizontal diplopia on primary gaze that
resolved when looking to the right or to the left. He actually
denies any further episodes of this. However, he has noted that
the vision in his right eye has also become progressively blurry
over this month. He has been mainly focused on the redness and
initially thought it was a minor infection that would pass. He
bought some eyedrops and when it did not resolve, went to see 
his
PCP today who referred him to the ED. 

On neuro ROS, the pt endorses mild frontal headache when his R
eye is having more pain, blurred vision and diplopia as above.
Denies loss of vision, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus
or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt endorses one night several
days ago of subjective fever/warmth, chills, and sweats at 
night.
During this night he also had some lightheadedness. Did not
recur. No weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of 
breath.
Denies chest pain or tightness.  Denies nausea, vomiting, or
abdominal pain. No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rash.
