History of Present Illness:
___ female with hypertension presents today with 
weakness
and "wooziness".  She was seen in our emergency room 3 days
earlier for similar complaints.  She reports that over the past 
5
days, she felt excessively tired and weak.  She was seen by her
PCP on ___ and was told she had a viral infection with an
increased white blood cell count.  She otherwise denies fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain shortness of breath, belly
pain, urinary or bowel symptoms.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.3 60 98/46 18 100% on 
room
air.  Orthostatics were positive.
Labs were notable for a BMP with BUN/creatinine of 40/1.1.  CBC
with 8/H of 10.5/30.6.  Electrolytes largely unremarkable. 
Troponin negative Ã—3.  TSH within normal limits vitamin B12
within normal limits.  CRP elevated at 61.
CT head without acute intracranial process.  CTA head and neck
with patent subclavian, common carotid, internal carotid, and
vertebral arteries.
She received 2 L of IV fluids.

She was evaluated by neurology felt that her clinical
presentation was most likely representing orthostatic
hypotension.  CTA head and neck and noncontrast head CT were
obtained and reassuring without large vessel occlusion or large
territory infarct.  According to neurology, she is chronic
narrowing of her left vertebral artery with distal 
reconstitution
and compensation from her right vertebral artery.  According to
neurology, her neurologic exam localized to the posterior 
column,
which could represent a metabolic etiology (B12 deficiency, TSH)
or from cervical spondylosis.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient tells the story as
follows.  He reports that approximately 1 week ago, she had an
annual visit with her primary care physician.  After that visit,
she noticed extreme fatigue and no appetite.  Subsequent days
were notable for decreased appetite, desire to constantly lie
down, and lightheadedness without vertigo upon standing.  She
feels she might of had a ___ fever, however never took her
temperature.  Only travel has been to ___ recently, and did not
include any significant hiking or outdoor activities.  She 
denies
sick contacts.  She otherwise denies runny nose, sore throat,
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, rash, blood in
stool or urine, numbness, tingling.  She endorses constipation
was chronic for her.  Patient is extremely thirsty and is asking
to drink.

Of note, last year she was told she had prediabetes, at which
time she reports her hemoglobin A1c was 6.4%.  She reports that
she is "extreme" and at that time she cut out all sugar and
became vegetarian.  Since that time she has had a 35 pound
intentional weight loss over the period of ___ year.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI.  All
other systems were reviewed and are negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with past medical history of 
hypertension, prediabetes, recent dieting with intentional 
weight loss, admitted with 1 week of poor appetite, 3 days of 
dizziness on standing, found to be orthostatic, thought to have 
likely had recent viral syndrome causing dehydration, treated 
with IV fluids and holding of home antihypertensives, with 
resolution of symptoms, able to safely ambulate, discharged 
home.

# Orthostatic Hypotension 
# Dizziness
Patient presented with 3 days of lightheadedness with standing 
in setting of 1 week of poor appetite and malaise.  Neurologic 
workup in ED with reassuring CT head and CTA head/neck, as well 
as neurology consult with a nonfocal neurologic exam.  Workup 
without signs of infection or metabolic derangement/deficiency.  
Vitals were notable for orthostatic hypotension.  Labs showed 
elevated ESR/CRP.  Suspect clinical picture suggests recent 
viral enteritis causing her to take in decreased PO, and get 
dehydrated.  This was likely complicated by her intentional 
weight loss over last 6 months, which may have resulted in her 
being especially sensitive to dehydration in the setting of her 
antihypertensive regimen (chlorthalidone, losartan).  
Antihypertensives were held and patient was given IV fluids 
resuscitation.  Her symptoms resolved over subsequent 48 hours.  
Her loss of appetite resolved and she was able to eat a regular 
diet and demonstrate ability to maintain hydration/nutrition.  
Given normal blood pressures this admission, continued to hold 
losartan and Chlorthalidone at discharge.  Per recommendations 
from neurology, could consider sending zinc level. 

# Hypertension
As above, held losartan and chlorthalidone 

# Hypomagnesemia
Thought to be secondary to poor PO intake.  Repleted.  

# Bilateral knee arthritis 
Held celecoxib given ___, restarted at discharge

Transitional issues
- Discharged home with PCP ___ 
- In setting of her intentional weight loss, may not require 
current antihypertensive regimen; home chlorthalidone and 
losartan were held this admission with subsequently blood 
pressures SBP ___ did not restart either at discharge; 
would consider blood pressure check at ___ and discussion 
re: whether antihypertensive medications are indicated 

> 30 minutes spent on this discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___: 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted 
with dizziness on standing.  You were seen by neurologists and 
underwent testing that was reassuring.  We believe your symptoms 
were caused by dehydration and low blood pressures that happened 
when you stood up ("orthostasis").  You were given IV fluids and 
you improved.  

You are now ready for discharge home.

During this hospital stay, you blood pressure medications were 
stopped.  It will be important for you to see you primary care 
doctor for ___ repeat blood pressure check and discussion about 
if/when these medications should be restarted. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
