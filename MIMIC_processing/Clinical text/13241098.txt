presentation.  The patient was discharged with ciprofloxacin 
orally to complete a 5 day course treatment END ___. 

# Urine retention:

scans of biopsies of the prostate that we have on record. He 
recalls a discussion with his urologist who performed the prior 
TURM during which he declined acting on the elevated PSA. His CT 
scan shows Bone metastatic from an unknown primary and to day 
there is no tissue diagnosis made yet.  Also noted on the CT 
from ___ are multiple hypodense lesions in the liver which 
might represent mets vs. intrusive liver masses.  The patient's 
LFTs and hospital were normal and his PSA was 83.  The patient 
elected to undergo tissue biopsy as an outpatient.

Transitional issues:
the patient was discharged with a Foley catheter due to 
diagnosis of urinary retention.  He will need a follow-up with 
the ___ clinic in ___ days for a void trial.
Patient will need a bone scan as an outpatient to characterize

lesions.  Also consider a dedicated liver MRI to examine further 
the liver lesions.
The patient was discharged on ciprofloxacin for a short 
duration therapy of UTI. END DATE ___.
