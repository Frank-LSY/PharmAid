History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a past medical history 
of atrial fibrillation with questionable anticoagulation 
compliance and hypertension who now presents to ___ with 
complaints of lightheadness and chest pain.

Patient has a short term memory and son has provided history and 
corroborated information. Mr ___ reports he awoke suddenly from 
sleep at 0400 on ___ with lightheadness, chest pressure and an 
"inability to control his limbs." This episode was not witnessed

IMAGING:
EKG ___:
Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Leftward 
axis. Inferior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate. 
Possible low voltage in the precordial leads. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ the heart rate is slower and 
premature ventricular contractions are no longer present. 

___ ___:
FINDINGS: There is no acute hemorrhage, edema or shift of the 
normally midline structures. Prominence of the ventricles and 
sulci is compatible with age related involutional changes. 
Confluent subcortical and periventricular white matter 
hypodensities, while nonspecific, are presumably sequela from 
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  Gray-white matter 
differentiation is preserved and there is no evidence for an 
acute vascular territorial infarction. There is mild mucosal 
thickening within the ethmoid air cells, otherwise, the included 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. There 
is no fracture. Soft tissue thickening is seen in the posterior 
upper neck is of uncertain etiology, correlate with direct 
visualization. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. Soft tissue thickening in the posterior upper neck is of 
uncertain 
etiology, correlate with direct visualization. 

Echocardiogram ___:
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is 
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular 
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There 
is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
findings are similar.  

CTA CHEST ___:
CTA THORAX:  The aorta and main thoracic vessels are well 
opacified. There is a moderately calcified thoracic aorta. There 
is a prominent mixed soft tissue and calcific atherosclerotic 
plaque at the origin of the brachiocephalic artery which appears 
to narrow the vessel lumen approximately 50%, grossly stable 
versus minimal interval progression in comparison to CT from 
___.  Additionally, there appears to be focal medialization of 
intimal calcification of the distal descending thoracic aorta at 
the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus, suggestive of chronic 
focal dissection.  This was seen on prior chest CT from ___, 
but appears somewhat more conspicuous on current exam. The 
pulmonary arteries are opacified to the subsegmental level 
without evidence of intraluminal filling defect. There is a 
filling defect in the left atrial appendage, concerning for 
thrombus. 
  
CT OF THE THORAX: The thyroid is unremarkable and there is no 
supraclavicular lymph node enlargement. The airways are patent 
to the subsegmental level. There is no mediastinal, hilar or 
axillary lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria.  Aortic, 
mitral, and coronary artery calcifications are noted. There is 
mild cardiomegaly. There is no pericardial effusion. No hiatal 
hernia or any other esophageal abnormality is present. Diffuse 
ground-glass opacities, most prominent in the dependent portions 
of the lung parenchyma, may relate to the expiratory phase of 
the scan, or possibly underlying pulmonary vascular congestion. 
Otherwise, the lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. Although this study is not designed for assessment 
of intra-abdominal structures, the visualized solid organs and 
the stomach are unremarkable.  The patient is status post 
cholecystectomy. 
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is minimal degenerative joint change of 
the imaged 
thoracic spine. Alignment is normal. There are no fracture, or 
concerning 
osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions identified. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Soft tissue density filling defect in the left atrial 
appendage raising concern for thrombus.  If desired, this could 
be further assessed with echocardiogram. 
3. Mixed atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the 
brachiocephalic artery which appears to narrow the vessel lumen 
approximately 50%, stable versus minimally progressed since 
___.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT
___ PMH Afib on anticoagulation and new ___ nerve palsy who 
presents with lightheadedness and chest pressure, admitted for 
concern of a left atrial thrombus and found to have marked 
bradycardia.

ACUTE ISSUES
# Chest ___: Patient ruled out for MI or PE in 
the emergency department. However, CTA noted a filling defect in 
the left atrium concerning for thrombus vs artifact. Patient's 
D-Dimer was 602. Admitted to floor and echocardiogram 
demonstrated no evidence of atrial thrombus. Infectious studies 
were negative. Home metoprolol dose was halved, as detailed 
below. 

# Bradycardia: Patient noted to have heart rates in the ___ 
while off his home metoprolol. While on the floor, telemetry 
demonstrated atrial fibrillation with rates in the ___ to ___, 
always asymptomatic. Rates would increase to ___ with 
walking. Home metoprolol dose (100mg) subsequently held and 
basal rates improved to 60-70s. Metoprolol re-introduced at half 
dose. Telemetry was reviewed by electophysiology who felt that 
there was no evidence of sick-sinu-syndrome or 
tachy-bradycardia. Patient walked with dose-reduced metoprolol 
and did not experience tachycardia. Patient discharged on 50mg 
metoprolol succinate.

# Third nerve palsy: Findings were consistent from earlier 
hospitalization. There was no change in patient's neurologic 
exam while hospitalized

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HTN: Blood pressures well controlled while inpatient; home 
HCTZ was discontinued for concerns of hyponatremia
# Chronic back pain/spinal stenosis: Provided analgesia PRN. 
Evaluated by ___ in house who recommended ___ rehab versus 
home with home rehab. 
# Cognitive impairment/Short term memory loss: Confirmed as 
baseline by family on admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Patient's metoprolol succinate was decreased to 50mg daily
# Hydrochlorathiazide was stopped while hospitalized; please 
check BPs and a serum sodium/potassium level at follow up visit.
# Patient noted to have inconsistent use of his rivaroxaban, 
please encourage regular daily use as an outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were brought to the hospital because you had an episode of 
chest pressure and lightheadedness while at home. In the ___ 
emergency room, serious causes of your symptoms such as a heart 
attack or blood clots in ___ lungs were ruled out with CT 
imaging, EKGs, and blood tests. However, one test indicated that 
you might have a blood clot in the lungs, and so you were 
admitted to the hospital.

While in the hospital, an echocardiogram was performed which 
showed definitively that there was no blood clot or mass in the 
heart and that the finding seen in the ED was an spurious 
artifact of the test itself. Your blood thinners (to protect 
against future clots) was restarted.

While admitted it was noted that your heart rate was very slow, 
even while off your medications. We do not believe the cause of 
your sympomts are due to a seizure or syncope and believe 
instead that your heart rate may have been too slow due to the 
medications you were taking. This medication (metoprolol) was 
decreased while hospitalized and remain at a lower dose after 
you are discharged.

Please take all medications as prescribed and keep all scheduled 
appointments. Notable, please take you rivaroxaban everyday as 
it is an important medication to prevent future blood clots from 
forming. If you experience the same symptoms that brought you to 
the hospital, develop any of the warning signs listed below, or 
have any other symptoms that concern you, please seek medical 
attention.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
Your ___ Care Team
