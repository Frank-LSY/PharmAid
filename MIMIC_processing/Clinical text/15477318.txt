Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest 
pain and shortness of breath. We though these symptoms might be 
due to a blockage in the arteries that go to your heart. 

The cardiologists did a cardiac catheterization, which is a 
procedure to take a look at your heart closely. This test showed 
completely normal arteries, so we don't think that they are 
causing your chest pain.

Your chest pain was decreased by the time the procedure was 
over, so we felt is was safe for you to leave the hospital. 
Please follow up with your care physician ___. on 
___ to work on what's causing chest pain. We are 
starting you on a cholesterol pill. We are also starting you on 
a medication called omeprazole (Prilosec) which helps reduce 
stomach acid. This may help alleviate your chest pain.

Please take all medications as prescribed and follow up with all 
medical appointments. It was a pleasure to take part in your 
medical care.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Health Team
