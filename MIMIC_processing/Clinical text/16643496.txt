Brief Hospital Course:
Febrile Neutropenia: 
On admission, she was started empirically on cefepime for 
febrile neutropenia.  Pt remained afebrile for the remainder of 
her hospitalization and symptoms completely resolved.  Pt did 
not have any recurrent diarrhea and pt was given one dose of 
filgrastim.  On HD#3, her WBC recovered with ANC >6000.  Blood 
Cultures were all negative for growth at 48hrs, influenza swab 
negative, urine culture <10,000 CFUs and upper resp viral panel 
was pending at the time of discharge.  Pt reported ongoing mild 
nasal congestion without sinus pain, pressure or sore throat.  
We decided to transition to oral Levofloxacin 750mg daily for 
another 4 days to complete a 7 day course for possible upper 
resp infection.  Primary oncologist was notified by email and 
agreed with plan for discharge home.  Pt has close follow up 
scheduled on ___ for next chemo treatment and I will contact 
the patient if the viral resp panel returns positive.
