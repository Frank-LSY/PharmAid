unknown origin. The patient was in her usual state of good 
health except for an episode hives the month prior to her sx 
starting and then she had 3 episodes of high fevers with a 
MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE of 105 over last 3 weeks. 

With regards to the episodes of hives, she developed pruritis on 
the back of her neck. She thought it was a mosquito bite. She 
then went out to see her neighbor who told her that she had a 
rash on her skin. She then took prednisone for 5 days after

resolved. She was admitted to an outside hospital twice. Testing

and completed course of antibiotics and 4 days of prednisone. 

Reviewing her d/c summary from her first admission in ___, 
she was found to have a small pleural effusion along with 
atelectasis and thus she was treated with levaquin. Imaging also 
revealed thickening of the gallbladder with possible fluid 
accumulation in the gallbladder. This raised the possibility of 
cholecysititis but the patient did not have sx clinically. A 
HIDA scan was negative. CT scan also demonstrated diverticulae 
without diverticulitis.  During the admission her bilirubin did 
increase but then went back down to 1.2. Her LFTS remained 
elevated at AST/ALT: 93/208 at discharge decreasing from 
482/316.  Rheumatologic w/u included lupus panel in which a PTT 
was slightly elevated, and a cardiolipin IgG was slightly 
elevated at 19 which was indeterminate. 

She is up to date with mammograms having had one in the last 
year and she had a colonoscopy within the past ___ years that 
was WNL per patient.

Of note she also received 6 days of prednisone for the pinched 
nerve in her neck to see if it could control the 
stinging/pruritis on her arms. The treatment that best helped 
that in the end was physicial therapy.

She recently traveled here from ___ on ___ to 
attend a college ___ but denies any other travel. She 
reports that the fever started again today. She was seen at ___ 
___ and found to be febrile to 101.4. A chest x-ray

elevated to 3.8. Potassium low at 3.4. LFTS WNL including direct 
bilirubin. WBC = 4.0 with 93% PMNS. UA negative. HCT = 38.7 with 
MCV = 106.9. 

The patient was then transferred to ___. Patient denies any
