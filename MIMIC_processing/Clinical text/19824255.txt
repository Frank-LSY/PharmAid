History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old female with PMH of self-reported 
depression, PCOS and GERD who was BIBA after being found about 
to jump into the ___ as a suicide attempt, held back 
by her boyfriend after an altercation.
On interview, she becomes intermittently tearful when discussing
her PCOS and the impact it has had on her mood, her anxieties
about whether she can have children in the future and the 
medical
complications she has had as a result (ruptured ovaries?). She
also reports depression that has been long-standing since ___
grade with episodes of depersonalization that occur in the
setting of overwhelming thoughts of suicide. She notes that she
has never tried to attempt suicide in the past because she was
too scared to do so and because there was always an external
support that would comfort her during these episodes (in the
past, her mother; recently, her boyfriend). She reports feeling
fine now and wanting to go home so that she can study for an 
exam
on ___ that she is very anxious about. She endorses ongoing
anxiety about the future, her finances, her health and fears an
impending breakup with her boyfriend. She also notes multiple
psychosocial stressors in the form of what she describes as
"over-controlling roommates and friends" whom she reports state
that her boyfriend and her are not a "good match". She endorses
that her low mood has been alienating others recently and 
without
the support of her boyfriend recently, whom she feels has been
pushing her away and distancing himself from her, she has felt
more lonely and depressed. She notes regret and guilt about 
using
her boyfriend "as my therapist" and notes that "that's why he
wants to break up with me...it's too much for anyone to be 
around
me." While she reports future-oriented thinking, she endorses
ruminative, hopeless thoughts about herself and her future. "

In the ED, no physical or chemical restraints were required.

On interview today, she has been going through a lot stress
lately. For the past month she notes feeling sad most days,
namely due to stress of school, financial stress ($50 spending
cash per month) which prevent her from doing social activities,
having to organize an ___ event, and interpersonal conflicts
with her roommates. For the past 2 to 3 weeks she notes having
suicidal thoughts. She describes the thoughts as "I want to get
out". These thoughts increased in frequency until she said "it
kind of all built up." Today, she admits her motivation when she
was running to the bank of the ___ was a want "to end her
pain". She said she verbalized to her boyfriend "I wanna get 
out,
I wanna get out" as she was running. She states though that she
stopped prior to jumping because three reasons: 1. she thought 
of
people that care about her and felt she could not do that to
others 2. a fear of pain, and 3. her ___ faith. She voices
regret about the event, and she understands why her boyfriend
called ___. She reiterates feeling likely she is burdening her
boyfriend and family because of her mental illness (e.g "I feel
horrible for people having to deal with me"). She notes very
frequent rumination regarding her future, her fertility in
setting of PCOS, and her health problems contributing to her
decline in school. She states she "wants to have hope", but she
has been finding it difficult because of her current situation.
Several times during the interview she stated that she can't
blame herself for health problems, but she also cannot afford 
the
treatment. Denies problems with sleep and appetite. Notes she 
can
usually concentrate well after she talks to someone about her
worries, which she feels is the way she processes things.

history of trauma from bullying (physical and verbal bullying). 
Her modifiable risk factors included suicidal ideation with 
plan, limited insight, hopelessness, limited coping skills, no 
established outpatient treatment, recent stressors (financial). 
The modificable risk factors were addressed during 
hospitalization via medication management, psychotherapeutic 
intervention, and aftercare coordination.  Finally, the patient 
is being discharged with many protective risk factors, including 
future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, no 
prior suicide attempts, reality testing ability, good coping 
skills, no history of substance use disorder, spirituality, and
