Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on ___ 
for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  Admission 
abdominal/pelvic CT revealed acute appendicitis. WBC was 
elevated at 13.  The patient underwent laparoscopic 
appendectomy, which went well without complication (reader 
referred to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor 
tolerating sips, on IV fluids, and IV analgesia for pain 
control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled with Tylenol alone. Diet was 
progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good 
tolerability. The patient failed his void trial and was straight 
catheterized. He was given Flomax. He failed a second time to 
void and was retaining over a liter of urine. The Foley was 
replaced and left in for 24 hours. On POD2, the Foley came out 
and the patient was then able to void without problem. A 
post-void scan showed zero residual. During this 
hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was 
adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and 
actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient and his father received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with acute appendicitis,

urinary retention and required the Foley be replaced.

discharged home to continue your recovery with the following 
instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:

feel you could respond in an emergency.

to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.

o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness".

mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.

prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
