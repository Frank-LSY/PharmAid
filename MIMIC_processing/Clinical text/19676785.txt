Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old single Caucasian woman, currently a 
freshman at ___, no formal psychiatric history but 
with symptoms of depression and anxiety beginning in high 
school, history of self injurious behaviors, no prior suicide 
attempts, who presented to ___ ED via EMS due to concerns for 
suicidal ideation in the setting of intoxication. 
. 
Interview with Ms. ___ is significant for onset of 
depressive and anxiety symptoms beginning in her ___ year of 
___ for unclear reasons with poor motivation, low mood, 
difficulties with concentration, possibly some sleep 
disturbances, with associated anxiety and self-injurious 
behaviors with worsening of symptoms in the setting of academic 
stressors, and her sister's recent depression and suicide 
attempt. Mental status examination on admission was notable for 
well-groomed woman, who is cooperative on examination, with 
depressed mood and affect slightly restricted but not 
dysthymic/dysphoric. 
. 
Diagnostically, differential diagnosis is broad at this time and 
includes major depressive disorder without psychotic features as 
well as a primary anxiety disorder such as generalized anxiety 
disorder. Given the relative stability of her depression over 
the past year and a half, I am concerned of the possibility of 
the emergence of an underlying personality disorder, 
particularly given her self-injurious behaviors, chronic 
feelings of emptiness, and descriptions of mood reactivity. Of 
note, nothing or history that would suggest a prior manic 
episode that would be concerning for bipolar disorder, although 
given her young age, this should certainly remain on the 
differential. No evidence to suggest a primary psychotic 
disorder at this time.  Although I do not believe she meets 
criteria for an alcohol use disorder at this time, her 
significant alcohol use prior to her presentation was clearly a 
precipitant to her presentation and increases her risk of self 
injury significantly.
. 
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted to Deaconess ___ on a 
___, upon admission she declined to sign a conditional 
voluntary form, stating she wanted to leave the hospital as soon 
as possible. She maintained her safety throughout her 
hospitalization on 15 minute checks and did not require physical 
or chemical restraints. Given her consistent denial of suicidal 
ideation with thought process that was linear, logical, goal and 
future oriented, I did not feel she met criteria to file a 7&8b 
and she was discharged upon expiration of her ___ on 
___. 
.

excellent behavioral control during her admission. She was

Vistaril, which was started at 25 mg po bid prn. Ms. ___ 
tolerated this medication well with no complaints of side 
effects 
- In the setting of the stabilizing environment of the milieu 
and the reduction academic stress (with the patient consistently

held with her mother, who stated she felt Ms. ___ looked 
well-- her mother felt comfortable with discharge on ___

this time and her mother felt comfortable with this plan; both

talked about risk reduction measures if she does drink alcohol
