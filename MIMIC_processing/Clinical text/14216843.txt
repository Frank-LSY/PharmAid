Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital after a right 
subclavian vein venoplasty.   To do this procedure, a small 
puncture was made into the right common femoral vein in your 
groin.  The puncture site heals on its own: there are no 
stitches to remove.   You tolerated the procedure well and are 
now ready to be discharged from the hospital.   Please follow 
the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery.

Puncture Site Care
For one week:
Do not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot 
tub.
Use only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around 
the puncture site. 
Gently pat the puncture site dry after showering. 
Do not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the 
puncture site. 

You may remove the bandage and shower the day after the 
procedure.  You may leave the bandage off. 
You may have a small bruise around the puncture site.  This is 
normal and will go away one-two weeks. 
Activity 

For the first 48 hours: 
Do not drive for 48 hours after the procedure
For the first week:
Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 
pounds
Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold 
your breath or bear down with abdominal muscles.   Take care not 
to put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, 
or moving your bowels.
After one week:
You may go back to all your regular activities, including 
sexual activity.  We suggest you begin your exercise program at 
half of your usual routine for the first few days.   You may 
then gradually work back to your full routine.

Medications:
Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  

SMOKING
If you smoke, it is very important that you STOP.   Research 
shows smoking makes vascular disease worse.  This could increase 
the chance of a blockage in your new graft.  Talk to your 
primary care physician about ways to quit smoking.
