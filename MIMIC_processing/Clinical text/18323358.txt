Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD#1, the patient's foley was discontinued and the patient 
was unable to void thereafter.  She was straight cath'ed x1.  
Overnight, the patient again was unable to completely void.  She 
had to be straight cath'ed again x1.  By the morning, the 
patient was able to void independently.  On POD#2, the patient 
complained of burning with urination.  A urinalysis was sent, 
which was negative.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was 
found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions.
