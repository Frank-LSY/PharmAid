NOTABLE IMAGING
===============
___ RUQUS - 2 hyperechoic liver lesions measuring up to 1 
cm and 0.9 cm.  In the absence of risk factors for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)/ chronic liver disease (ie.  
hepatitis B), these likely represent hemangiomas.  If there are 
risk factors, recommend further evaluation with MRI. No intra or 
extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Multiple gallbladder polyps 
measuring up to 8 mm.  Recommend followup ultrasound in 6 
months. Mild splenomegaly measuring up to 14.5 cm.

___ R NECK US - No evidence of thrombosis in the right 
internal jugular vein. Right cervical lymphadenopathy, likely 
reactive.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=====================

#Fevers:
On admission w/ T 100.5 in ED and one additional fever about 24 
hours later. Constellation of persistent fevers, cervical 
lymphadenopathy, and LFT elevations suggested EBV, CMV, 
toxoplasmosis, or HIV. Low suspicion for HIV given SH. Monospot 
negative x2. Toxo, EBV, CMV serologies sent.  Added serologies 
for anaplasma and ehrlichiosis given possible presentations w/o 
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.  Blood cx negative x 48 hours.  
CT chest/abd/pelvis obtained prior to discharge to assess for 
lymphadenopathy, however read was pending at time of discharge. 

#LFT Elevations:
Per records from ___, initially had smaller elevation on 
___ when Amoxicillin started, with significant interval 
increase by ___. Believed that initial elevation caused by 
infectious process as above, with subsequent elevation due to 
infection progression or additional injury from amoxicillin. 
Amoxicillin discontinued.  Pt advised to have LFTs drawn at ___ 
tomorrow to ensure not rising.  

#Multiple Gallbladder Polyps:
Radiology recommended 6 month follow-up.
