History of Present Illness:
___ year old with no significant PMH presenting as transfer from 
___ for evaluation of chest pain.  Per report, pt was 
sitting at his computer reading the morning of ___ when he 
developed a sudden onset choking sensation in his throat with 
associated anterior chest tightness and discomfort. He reports 
some diaphoresis and noted that the anterior chest discomfort 
was worse with deep inspiration. EMS was called and pt was given 
aspirin and two SL nitro tablets, which did not improve his 
chest discomfort. He was subsequently taken to ___ where 
EKG did not demonstrate evidence of ischemia. CXR and neck X-ray 
were unremarkable. Pt was given a GI cocktail with no immediate 
improvement in symptoms, however his choking sensation improved 
while in the ED. Initial troponin I was 0.01 and second troponin 
I at 3 hrs was 0.05. EKG was repeated, and again did not 
demonstrate ischemic changes. However, pt was noted to have 
developed a left arm aching. SL nitro was administered and the 
pt's pain resolved. Pt was seen by ___ of interventional 
cardiology at ___ and did not believe pt needed urgent 
cardiac cath, but recommended transfer to ___. In addition, he 
was started on a heparin gtt and nitroglycerin gtt prior to 
transfer.  
 In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.8 90 123/67 18 94% RA  
 - Exam was normal  
 - Labs were notable for: WBC 17.1, H/H 13.2/39.7, plts 255, Na 
139, BUN/Cr ___, INR 1.1, troponin <0.01  
 - Imaging: OSH CXR and neck X-ray uploaded from OSH  
 - The patient was given: Heparin gtt, Nitroglycerin gtt, 
Tylenol ___ PO x 1  
 - Consults: Cardiology was consulted and recommended admission 
to ___  
 ___ prior to transfer were: 99.1 86 110/57 18 93% RA  
 Upon arrival to the floor, pt reports some chest discomfort 
with deep inspiration, but otherwise states that since the 
nitroglycerin gtt was started he was been largely CP free.

 EKG ___ at 16:50: NSR at 89, mildly prolonged PR, LAD  
 EKG ___ at 12:36: NSR at 88, mildly prolonged PR, LAD  

___ EKG: Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression. No other

___ CTA Chest
FINDINGS: The aorta and its major branch vessels are patent, 
with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or 
aneurysmal formation.  There is no evidence of penetrating 
atherosclerotic ulcer or aortic arch atheroma present. The 
pulmonary arteries are well opacified to the subsegmental level, 
with no evidence of filling defect within the main, right, left, 
lobar, segmental or subsegmental pulmonary arteries.  The main 
and right pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber, and there is 
no evidence of right heart strain. There is no supraclavicular, 
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The thyroid 
gland appears unremarkable. There is no evidence of pericardial 
effusion.  There is no pleural effusion. Mild bibasal 
atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary parenchymal 
abnormality. The airways are patent to the subsegmental level.   
Limited images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. No lytic 
or blastic osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy is 
identified.  
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic 
abnormality. 

___ TTE 
Left atrial volume is normal. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and regional/global 
systolic function (biplane LVEF = 72 %). Transmitral and tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
No pathologic flow identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old with no significant PMH presenting as transfer from 
___ for evaluation of chest pain. 

#Chest pain: Patient initially presented to ___, where 
EKG was negative for ischemia. Initial troponin I was 0.01 and 
second troponin I at 3 hrs was 0.05. Given rising troponin and 
improvement in pain with SL nitro, he was initiated on heparin 
gtt and nitro gtt. It was not felt that an urgent cath was 
needed, and he was transferred to ___ for further management. 
At ___, troponins were negative and EKG did not show ST 
changes. He did have a CTA chest given pleuritic nature of pain, 
obesity, and relative immobility; CTA was negative for PE.  He 
continued on heparin gtt and nitro gtt was transitioned to 
isordil. He was placed on aspirin, atorvastatin 80, and 
metoprolol 12.5 mg BID. He underwent cardiac cath which showed 
normal coronary anatomy with slow flow. Given clean coronary 
anatomy, normal lipid panel, and normal A1c (5.3%), this was 
narrowed to aspirin 81, atorvastatin 20 mg qHS, and metoprolol 
XL 25 mg daily. Patient was chest pain free and ambulating well 
with O2 sats 97% on RA by the time of discharge. 

#Elevated JVD: Patient noted to have elevated JVD to 11 cm after 
cath, which was attributed to IVF. He was asymptomatic without 
SOB or fatigue. Of note, he had a TTE that showed EF 72%, 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function, 
and no significant valve disease. However, given concern for 
volume overload based on exam, he was discharged with Lasix 20 
mg po PRN for SOB and instructed to call MD if weight increases 
by 3 lbs. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please follow up clinically for SOB, fatigue given elevated 
JVP to 11 cm on the day of discharge. Patient has no h/o HF and 
TTE showed preserved EF. He had normal ambulatory sats (97% on 
RA) and was asymptomatic at time of discharge. JVD was felt to 
be ___ IVF and dye during cardiac cath. However, given concern 
for volume overload based on exam, he was discharged with Lasix 
20 mg po PRN for SOB and instructed to call MD if weight 
increases by 3 lbs. 
- A1c this admission 5.3%
- Please f/u baseline LFTs as starting statin 
- Lipid panel this admission: Cholest 154, ___ 90 HDL 50 LDL 86 
- Discharge weight: 111.5 kg
- Contact: ___ (___) ___ ___ 
(Sister) ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___. You 
presented to us with chest discomfort and concern for heart 
attack. You underwent cardiac catheterization that did not show 
any significant blockage of your coronary arteries. We started 
three new medications including aspirin, atorvastatin, and 
metoprolol that are all protective of your heart and are for 
prevention of heart disease. 

Please take all your medication as prescribed. Please attend all 
your follow up appointments. You will see your PCP and should 
follow up with Dr. ___ your cardiologist. If you have 
any worsening symptoms, or you do not hear from us regarding an 
appointment, please call the cardiology offices at ___. 
If you do experience chest pain, you should try the 
nitroglycerin we are prescribing and should go to the emergency 
room if chest pain persists.

Finally, please weigh yourself daily and please call your 
cardiologist, Dr. ___, at ___ if it increases by 3 
or more pounds. If you experience shortness of breath, it may be 
due to fluid overload. Therefore, we are giving you a few 
tablets of Lasix aka furosemide which can help remove fluid if 
necessary. 

Best,
Your ___ team
