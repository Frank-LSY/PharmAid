setting of medication noncompliance and exhibiting 
signs/symptoms concerning of catatonia.

Per Dr. ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry
Consult note:
"Pt is referred to ED under ___ by her psychiatrist Dr. 
___ visiting her clinic today. She was found to have 
disorganized speech, with delay in finding words and poor oral 
intake. Interview was limited by patient's poverty of thought 
and slow responses, but she initially said she was feeling 
"fine" and nodded when asked if she was feeling like her normal 
self, and only admitted to her speech being slowed when it was 
pointed out to her and she was asked if she noticed it. She 
reports that she feels that her thinking is clear, and shrugs 
when asked why her speech is slowed. She reports that she 
self-discontinued her aripiprazole about a month ago due to 
headaches, and denies noticing any new symptoms since 
discontinuing her medication. She denies SI, HI, and AVH, 
reports that her mood is "fine" and that her sleep and appetite 
have been "normal." 

When we discussed restarting the aripiprazole, she initially 
stated that she wanted to try therapy first and that she wanted 
to talk about it with her mother. Despite continuing to voice no 
complaints, she was amenable to inpatient hospitalization." 

Per Dr. ___, mother (___) and father reported 
that the patient has been appearing very depressed and 
disorganized for 1 week or so. Speech was described by mother as 
being "delayed", "being out of reality", and patient 
experiencing frustrations at not being able to get words out of 
her mouth. Mother believes that patient has not been taking 
medications for approximately 1 month.

Per Dr. ___, Dr. ___ that patient has 
never been as disorganized as today (known to Dr. ___ 
about ___ year). Patient was "nearly mute on exam", "taking nearly 
15 minutes to speak, with concerns for possible catatonia". 
Recent psychosocial stressors include dropping out of school 
recently and the patient realizing her student loans are due
soon. Dr. ___ patient could benefit from 
hospitalization due to her medication noncompliance and that her 
presentation could rapidly improve with resuming ___. 

In the ED, the patient was intermittently cooperative with 
medical exam, was found to have sinus tachycardia and poor oral 
intake. She received 3 L of NS IVF, ondansetron 4 mg IV, and 
aripiprazole 15 mg po. Tachycardia resolved after IVF. She was 
also given fosfomycin 3 g po once for UTI. Patient was medically
cleared for inpatient psychiatric admission.

Interview today limited due to patient being disorganized with 
paucity of thought. Patient states that she believes she is in 
the hospital to get further workup of her heart rate being 
abnormal. When asked if she has any psychiatric conditions she 
is admitted for treatment for, shakes her head and states she
disagrees with need for inpatient admission. Spends over 20 
minutes when determining whether she will sign CV form or not, 
stating that she does not think she needs to be in the hospital 
for mental health issues, but then asking to read and re-read 
the form numerous times, and asking if the form is related to 
her education. Despite having the CV vs. involuntary status 
explained numerous times, continues to ask to re-read the forms 
and states "I sometimes have a difficult time processing 
information" and ultimately states she will not sign the forms.

States that her mood currently is "flat". When asked what she 
means by this, states that it is hard for her to understand what 
another person may be saying. States this has been ongoing for 
about one week. When asked if she was experiencing any other 
symptoms or changes, shakes her head. 

Denies AVH/SI/HI, thought broadcasting/ideas of reference, 
feeling paranoid that people are out to get her, or other s/s of 
psychosis other than that she is having a difficult time 
processing what people say sometimes (for the past week).

Endorses feeling depressed, primarily due to leaving school. 
States that reason for leaving school was that it was 
"overwhelming" for her (was a freshman). When asked what she 
planned on majoring in, replies she does not remember. When 
asked what classes she was taking, states she does not remember. 
Denies joining groups or participating in any activities. States 
she enjoys dancing bachata and shares that she was dancing today 
and had fun, but then states "I wasn't really dancing, I was 
just like this [waves her hands in the air left and right]". 
Believes she can still enjoy (negative for anhedonia) activities 
like
bachata and reading. Endorses appetite decrease and weight loss 
recently, but responds "I'm not sure" when asked to give a 
general timeframe. Endorses increased sleep than usual, but 
states "I don't know" when asked how many hours she sleeps, but 
shares that she thinks hypersomnia has been for one week. Denies
psychomotor retardation, fatigue/loss of energy, 
worthlessness/guilt, poor concentration, hopelessness, or 
thoughts of death/SI.

When asked what she would like help for while on Deac4, shares 
that she would like to "get medications, talk to doctors to ___ 
which medication is the best for me". When asked what the 
medication would be treating, shrugs; when asked if this is for 
her abnormal heart rate (as she had stated initially as the
reason for admission), shakes her head, and when asked if this 
would be for her mental health condition, nods "yes". However, 
when asked which condition it is and if she is familiar with 
'schizoaffective' shakes her head, and when asked what she was 
being treated for by Dr. ___. When asked if it was
depression/bipolar disorder/anxiety, shakes her head and shrugs.

Epi-___. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient was initially placed on ___ due 
to indecision about signing conditional voluntary. She 
subsequently signed a conditional voluntary agreement and it was 
accepted. She was also placed on 15 minute checks status on 
admission and remained on that level of observation while being 
unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
At presentation to ED, she was noted to have delayed speech, 
poverty of content, and poor oral intake in the setting of her 
medication non compliance and multiple psychosocial stressors, 
including financial stress and recent challenges at school. 
Collateral from her outpatient psychiatrist Dr. ___ 
family members suggested delayed speech, near mutism, and poor 
oral intake in the setting of discontinuation of aripiprazole 
(___) 1 month ago.  Dr. ___ patient on ___ and sent her to the ED due to concern for these symptoms and 
possible catatonia.

At presentation to inpatient unit, patient had similar speech 
latency as in ED. Treatment team initially offered interpreter 
and began interview in ___, but patient indicated she 
preferred to conduct interview in ___. She stated that 
___ is her first language, but that she studied ___ in 
college and felt comfortable conversing in ___. Over the 
next few days, patient improved significantly from her initial 
presentation after resuming oral ___, demonstrating 
decreased latency, more articulate self-expression, improved 
self care behaviors with more goal-directed activity. An ativan 
1mg PO challenge was attempted to see if this would improve her 
residual speech latency and paucity of thought content, given 
concern for possible catatonia, but it only resulted in 
increased sedation. Because of this and good response to 
___, and after discussion with outpatient providers who 
recommended IM ___ maintenna for compliance issues, we 
recommended injectible ___. Patient provided informed 
consent to receive this injection, after she inquired and 
received information about potential side effects and 
alternatives. Specifically, patient inquired if she would have 
to receive the injection ongoing; clarified that she would be 
able to decide in one month's time if she desired to receive 
another injection, or resume taking oral ___. After this 
discussion, patient stated that she was willing to receive 400mg 
___ Maintenna. 

On the evening of ___, she had an episode of catatonic 
symptoms including waxy flexibility, increased muscle tone, 
mutism, and stupor. The symptoms seemed to improve after 
administration of lorazepam and IV fluids. Vital signs at the 
time were notable for tachycardia, which was present on 
admission and evaluated at ___ one week prior (thought to be ___ 
patient's PCOS). Her labs were unremarkable with normal CK and 
WBC within normal limits, thus ruling out neuroleptic malignant 
syndrome. Since that episode, she had no further episodes of 
similar severity. However, she did continue to demonstrate 
periodic odd behavior and affect, decreased spontaneous 
movement, and decreased spontaneous speech output. Of note, this 
odd behavior appeared to vary substantially based upon the 
individual(s) with whom she was interacting. She demonstrated 
remarkably improved speech fluency, affect, and behavior in the 
presence of family, ___ interpreter, or when discussing 
topics of interest to her. Across interview settings, she 
demonstrated persistent concreteness in her abstracting ability, 
often perseverating on word-choice. 

Overall, patient's odd behavior and negativism are suggestive of 
chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with 
superimposed dependent personality traits, exacerbated by 
medication non-adherence and life stressors. We cannot exclude 
the possibility that patient has been having catatonic episodes, 
but it is reassuring that her symptoms improve with her social 
context. Therefore,  antipsychotics are more likely to help than 
to worsen her catatonia-like symptoms. Based on available 
information, treatment team recommends ongoing monthly IM 
___ maintenna, with two weeks of oral ___ 15mg daily 
while the drug concentration from IM ___ equilibrates. 
Review of records indicates that patient's symptoms 
significantly worsen when she has discontinued her oral 
medications, thus ___ will likely improve her adherence. 
A short course of ativan 1mg TID:PRN will be offered as needed 
for recurrent catatonic symptoms, since it was helpful during 
her last episode. It will likely be helpful for patient to be 
reintegrated into a familiar outpatient routine and to re-engage 
with outpatient providers.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS: n/a

4. MEDICAL
#) PCOS
- Recently seen at ___ for tachycardia which was attributed to 
PCOS and poor PO intake. Patient not currently on. Recommend

post-discharge appointment was arranged (see below)

#) Tachycardia
- Patient was intermittently tachycardic at presentation to ED 
and throughout her hospitalization, ranging from ___
- Tachycardic at presentation, initially thought to be due to 
dehydration secondary to reported poor PO intake. she received 
IV fluids in the ED and once in the psychiatric unit. 
Subsequently, she appeared clinically euvolemic but continued to 
have tachycardia.
- Reportedly this is a known issue due to her PCOS.
- Recommend encouraging PO fluid intake and outpatient primary 
care followup for this issue.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The

discharge summary to above 

INFORMED CONSENT: 
___ maintenna, ___ PO, Ativan PO
The team discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, 
and possible side effects and risks of starting this medication 
(including but not limited to EPS/dystonias, tardive dyskinesia, 
weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, injection site 
discomfort), and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, 
including not taking the medication, with this patient. We 
discussed the patient's right to decide whether to take this 
medication as well as the importance of the patient's actively 
participating in the treatment and discussing any questions 
about medications with the treatment team.  The patient appeared 
able to understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
inability to care for self given acute decompensation of primary 
psychotic disorder and poor oral intake resulting in need for IV 
fluid repletion in the ED. Their static risk factors at that 
time included chronic mental illness and age. The modifiable 
risk factors included psychosis, disorganized/unpredictable 
behavior, medication non-compliance, social withdrawal, poor 
reality testing, and lack of purpose. We addressed those risk 
factors through medication management and individual 
psychotherapy. Finally, the patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors, including help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, 
positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, 
strong social support and outpatient treatment team, lack of 
suicidal ideation.
