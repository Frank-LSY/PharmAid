On admission, the patient refused to sign a conditional 
voluntary agreement and was admitted on a ___, which 
expired on ___.  At that time the patient was not deemed to 
be at risk of harm to self/others, so he was discharged.  They 
were also placed on q15 minute checks status on admission and 
remained on that level of observation throughout while being 
unit restricted.  There were no safety concerns or events for 
the patient during the admission.  

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) MDD vs substance induced mood disorder 
The patient had gone to his PCP to ask for antidepressants as he 
was feeling depressed being unable to see his younger brother.  
However, he endorsed suicidal ideation and was asked to go to 
the ED for evaluation.  On the unit, the patient endorsed 
feeling depressed for a few days as his father won't allow him 
to see or speak to his younger brother because his father thinks 
he is a bad influence.  This has been going on for several 
years.  The patient denied suicidal ideation and stated that he 
had been drinking prior to the appointment and didn't mean what 
he said.  He was interested in starting an antidepressant, so 
Remeron 7.5 mg was started to help him sleep and because he 
reported a history of feeling more agitated and anxious on 
Prozac.  He did not wish to sign a CV as he did not agree with 
the admission and wanted to be discharged.  He was interested in 
doing weekly 1:1 therapy but was not as interested in a partial 
program.  He endorsed a difficult relationship with his father 
who he feels tries to control his life.  He was able to 
articulate that he wants his own life, independence and family 
but has no specific plans as to how he wants to achieve these 
things.  His presentation is concerning for a mood disorder, 
however, with the given history of alcohol use and reported 
resolution of his symptoms with no substance use in the hospital 
it is difficult to distinguish from a substance induced mood 
disorder.  However, per collateral, patient did not appear 
intoxicated at PCP ___.      

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Alcohol: Unclear how much patient is drinking as he was not 
very specific.  Possibly up to a pint of vodka a day, though not 
every day.  
 Cocaine: Patient denied cocaine use but had a positive tox 
screen for cocaine.

4. MEDICAL
#) Denies any medical problems 

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patientÂ’s primary team met with them daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
The patient refused to allow his family to be contacted.  He did 
allow team to speak with his PCP's office and the therapist he 
saw prior to admission.  

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Remeron 7.5 mg QHS 
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon his depressed mood 
and suicidal thoughts.  Their static factors noted at that time 
include history of suicide attempts, history of substance abuse, 
male gender, age, marital status.  The modifiable risk factors 
included lack of outpatient mental health providers, active 
substance use, limited coping skills and insomnia.  He was 
prescribed Remeron to help with his depression and sleep.  He 
was encouraged to attend coping skills groups on the unit, but 
declined.  He was agreeable to out patient therapy and was 
referred to an outpatient therapist.  Finally, the patient is 
being discharged with many protective risk factors, help-seeking 
nature, future-oriented viewpoint and sense of responsibility to 
family.  Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at 
this time, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is guarded as he did not engage 
extensively on the unit in groups and is likely minimizing his 
depression and substance use.  However, he was interested in 
individual therapy and medications and if he is able to follow 
through with therapy and engage in treatment he would likely do 
well.
