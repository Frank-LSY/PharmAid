Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to Dr. ___ for 
nephrolithiasis management with a known 1.5 cm stone in the 
lower pole moiety with known duplex left collecting system. She 
underwent cystoscopy, left retrograde pyelogram with 
interpretation, difficult left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy 
of impacted stone in lower pole moiety duplex collecting system, 
placement of ureteral stent in each moiety of duplex
left ureteral collecting system. She tolerated the procedure 
well and recovered in the PACU before transfer to the general 
surgical floor. She was admitted for overnight "sepsis watch", 
observation given her past history of urosepsis and intraop 
findings of what appeared to be purulent urine in Left kidney 
(sent for culture) See the dictated operative note for full 
details. Overnight, Ms. ___ was hydrated with intravenous 
fluids and received appropriate perioperative prophylactic 
antibiotics. On POD1, urethral foley catheter was removed and 
she voided without difficulty. At discharge on POD1, patients 
pain was controlled with oral pain medications, tolerating 
regular diet, ambulating without assistance, and voiding without 
difficulty.  Ms. ___ was explicitly advised to follow up as 
directed as the indwelling ureteral stents must be removed and 
or exchanged and to address the need to return for a repeat 
(second stager) ureteroscopy.

Discharge Instructions:
-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to 
possibly experience some urgency and frequency over the next 
month;  this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or 
the indwelling ureteral stent.

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter.; This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed. 

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) 

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You 
should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.  HOLD ASPIRIN and aspirin containing products for one 
week unless otherwise advised.

-IBUPROFEN (the ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be taken 
even though you may also be taking Tylenol/Acetaminophen. You 
may alternate these medications for pain control. For pain 
control, try TYLENOL FIRST, then ibuprofen, and then take the 
narcotic pain medication as prescribed if additional pain relief 
is needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)

-You MAY be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM 
that will help with the "burning" pain you may experience when 
voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.

gentle laxative. These are  over-the-counter medications that 
may be health care spending account reimbursable. 

-Colace (docusate sodium) may have been prescribed to avoid 
post-surgical constipation or constipation related to use of 
narcotic pain medications. Discontinue if loose stool or 
diarrhea develops. Colace is a stool-softener, NOT a laxative.
