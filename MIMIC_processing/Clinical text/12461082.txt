Brief Hospital Course:
----Psychiatric

#Schizophrenia
On admission, the patient presented with disorganization, 
irritability, and poor self-care. This was in the context of 
lack of follow up with outpatient treatment and missing her last 
haldol decanoate injection. Per collateral from the patient's 
community team, this was a typical presentation for the 
patient's decompensation when noncompliant with her medication. 
A copy of the patient's ___ (8b) was obtained and the patient 
was continued on Haldol 5mg po TID. She was given an initial 
injection of IM haldol decanoate in the ED prior to admission. 
The patient preferred to be continued on IM haldol decanoate 
rather than po. She was loaded 100mg injections x3 during her 
hospitalization. With this, her affect and disorganization 
improved. She became more pleasant, was less intrusive with 
peers and staff, her ADLs improved, and she was more 
redirectible. Her outpatient case manager and treatment team 
were contacted for collateral information and coordination of 
care. Upon discharge, the patient had no SI/HI, no A/VH, no 
overt delusions, no paranoia, no LOA, and her affect was 
brighter. Aftercare plan is to follow up with her psychiatrist 
at the ___ for monthly haldol injections.

----Medical
There were no active medical issues.
 
----Psychosocial

#Groups/Milieu
Pt was encouraged to participate in unitÂ’s groups/milieu/therapy 
opportunities. The patient, however, was initially too intrusive 
and irritable with peers and staff and remained from groups. She 
was initially on more frequent checks and improved to q15 min 
checks as her disorganization became better. There were no 
safety problems while on the unit.

----Legal Status 
Patient was admitted on a ___ and later signed a CV. She 
remained on such throughout the remainder of the admission. 
Patient does has ___ guardianship which needs review on 
___ per collateral from her ___ case worker.

----Risk Assessment
Ms. ___ remains at moderate chronic risk of inability to care 
for herself in the community due to her chronic mental illness, 
race, and age. These are complicated by her homelessness, 
unemployment, h/o poor med compliance, and lack of follow up 
with outpatient treaters. However, during her admission, she was 
restarted on her medication regimen, she was connected back with 
her outpatient treatment team, and positively is connected with 
a community team who follows her long term. She also has had 
improved self-care and disorganization with reinitiation of her 
medications. Her acute risk at this time is such that she no 
longer requires inpatient psychiatric hospitalization and the 
least restrictive setting for her care at this time is 
outpatient management.
