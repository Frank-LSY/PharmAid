Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with pulmonary fibrosis on 
chronic prednisone and home O2 with exertion, asthma, and RA, 
who presented to the hospital with generalized weakness and an 
episode of fecal urge incontinence. 

#Generalized weakness 
#Hypoxia
The patient came to ___ from ___ as his daughter was 
having medical treatments. He has been caring for both his 
daughter, and also for his wife with ___. He shares he 
has not been eating or drinking much during this trip, as he has 
been stressed with his caregiver duties. Two days before 
presentation he began to feel progressive generalized weakness 
and fatigue. The day of presentation he had an episode of urge 
fecal incontinence without diarrhea; he says he felt too weak to 
make it to the bathroom in time. This happened twice. He has a 
chronic cough, but did not experience any worsening of this. He 
had no shortness of breath or subjective fevers or chills. He 
presented to the ED at the urge of his daughter, where he had a 
low grade fever and creatinine of 1.5. He was also found to be 
hypoxic to high ___ on room air with no respiratory distress. 
Labs were unrevealing, as was chest Xray. EKG showed normal 
sinus rhythm, as did telemetry. He was given 
azithromycin/ceftriaxone to cover for pneumonia in the ED and 
started on a higher dose of steroids. After less than 12 hours 
of hospitalization he was rapidly improved and feeling well with 
no focal complaints and no focal findings on exam (clear lungs, 
well appearing). His oxygen was in the low ___ on room air, and 
he shares that he often drops to high ___ with exertion and dose 
wear O2 at home. Decision was made to discontinue antibiotics as 
there was no signs of clear bacterial infection. His symptoms 
may have been triggered by dehydration, or relative adrenal 
insufficiency in the setting of recently tapered on steroids. He 
was maintained on 40 mg prednisone, which he will continue until 
he sees his primary care doctor in ___ on ___.

#Acute Kidney Injury
Initially with Cr of 1.4 which improved to 1.2 after IVF likely 
representing pre-renal azotemia secondary to hypovolemia. 

#Asthma
#Pulmonary fibrosis
Continued on home inhalers, montelukast and steroids as above.

#Troponinemia
EKG with no signs of ischemia. Elevated troponins (peaked at 
0.05 -> 0.02 -> 0.02) potentially in the setting of type 2 
demand, but suspect may have been to poor renal clearance in the 
setting of ___.

#HTN
Home enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide were held in the setting 
of acute illness and ___. Patient will follow up with his PCP 
regarding restarting these.

#Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Hydroxychlorquinone was continued and prednisone was increased 
to a larger dose as above.

#BPH
Continued on home tamsulosin and finasteride. 

#OSA 
Continued on CPAP as an inpatient.
