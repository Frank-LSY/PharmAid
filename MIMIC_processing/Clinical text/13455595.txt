Pertinent Results:
___: CT head ___: small L tentorial subdural
hematoma without significant mass effect

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:  
Subdural hematoma layers along the left tentorium is stable in 
size relative to prior examination. There is no significant mass 
effect. 
Prominent ventricles and sulci likely reflect age related volume 
loss.  
Periventricular and scattered white matter hypodensities are 
nonspecific 
though likely sequela of chronic ischemia. 
Right occipital encephalomalacia.

___ Head/Neck MRI/MRA (wet read)
Noted again is a small, stable, left tentorial SDH.  There are 
no new hemorrhages or acute findings.  Again is noted 
encephalomalacia of the right cerebellum consistent with 
microvascular changes and old infarct.

On ___, the patient remained stable.  He ambulated
