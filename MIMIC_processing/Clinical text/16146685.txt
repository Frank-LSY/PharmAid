Studies:
Venous Duplex Reflux LLE ___: There is normal 
compressibility, flow and augmentation of the left common 
femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal color flow and 
compressibility are demonstrated in the posterior tibial and 
peroneal veins. There is normal respiratory variation in the 
common femoral veins bilaterally. No deep vein reflux is 
identified. The left great saphenous vein is patent throughout 
and no reflux is identified.  Prominent left groin and left 
upper thigh lymph nodes are present. 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No evidence of left deep vein or great saphenous vein 
reflux. 
2.  No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity. 
3.  Prominent enlarged left groin and upper thigh lymph nodes. 

MR ___ w and w/o contrast ___: 
1. Expected postsurgical changes from a cervicectomy. No 
evidence of an 
intrapelvic abscess. 
2. Nonspecific enlarged left inguinal lymph nodes. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
===============================
___ year old F with hx of cervical cancer (s/p radical 
trachelectomy & pelvic lymphadenectomy), resultant left leg 
lymphedema, and recent GBS bacteremia/possible endocarditis (s/p 
4 weeks of IV penicillin), now presenting from home with fevers, 
headache, lightheadedness, left hip pain and rash on her left 
thigh.

#Fever, leg rash: Overnight after admission, the patient's fever 
broke and never recurred. Her L leg pain did improve 
significantly and venous duplex and MRI of her pelvis did not 
show any abnormalities or source of infection. She only received 
one dose of Vancomycin so it is unlikely that she had an episode 
of cellulitis. It is unclear what the leg pain and pink rash 
came from although it may have been related to hiking or roller 
derby injury. She was discharged home with plan for close 
outpatient follow up with her PCP and vascular surgery. Her 
fever also improved spontaneously and most likely was related to 
self-limited viral illness.

#Chronic lymphedema s/p lymphadenectomy and ?venous 
insufficiency: unlikely directly related to recent complaint of 
fever and leg pain. Vascular surgery consulted who recommended 
venous duplex reflux study which was normal. She will follow up 
with vascular surgery as an outpatient.

#She was also found to have a sinus arrhythmia and due to family 
history of sudden death due to cardiac dysrhythmia in her father 
we scheduled an electrophysiology appointment for her. She is 
asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint.

Transitional Issues:
==============================
1.Pt will need Electrophysiology follow up as an outpatient due 
to her family history positive for her father dying at a young 
age of sudden cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient also has sinus 
arrhythmia.
2. Please ensure close vascular follow up for further workup of 
left leg discoloration.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because you were having fevers, leg 
rash, and leg pain. We were concerned about an infection 
especially one involving your vascular system or lymphatic 
system, so we did an ultrasound of your leg which was normal. We 
were also concerned that you may have an abscess so we did an 
MRI of your pelvis which did not show any evidence of any source 
of infection. You improved symptomatically throughout the 
hospital stay and you did not have any fevers so we felt 
comfortably sending you home with close follow up especially 
with Vascular surgery in order to further work up your leg 
problems. We also noticed that your heartrate was slightly 
abnormal which you have been told in the past. We want you to 
see an Electrophysiology cardiologist just to be safe. We wish 
you all the best.

Sincerely,
Your Care Team at ___
