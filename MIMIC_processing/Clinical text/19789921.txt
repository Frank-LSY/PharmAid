infectious work-up (UA, CXR, CT neck, CT abd/pelvis) was pursued 
which was unremarkable. Patient was monitored overnight with no 
further fevers.

# Hypotension: patient found to have relatively low BPs in the 
ED (82-112/43-61). Recorded outpatient BPs in the ___, so 
this is not far from his baseline. Likely due to dehydration in

and pureed solids with thin liquids.
