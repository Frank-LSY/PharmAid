These steps can help you recover after your procedure. 
DO drink plenty of water to flush out the bladder.

fiber-containing foods and avoid foods that can cause 
constipation. Ask your doctor if you should take a laxative if 
you do become constipated. 

Don't take blood-thinning medications until your doctor says 
it's OK. 

Don't do any strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 
four to six weeks or until your doctor says it's OK. 

Don't have sex. You'll likely be able to resume sexual activity 
in about four to six weeks.

drive once your catheter is removed and you're no longer taking 
prescription pain medications. 

You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve. You may 
have clear or yellow urine that periodically turns pink/red 
throughout the healing process. Generally, the discoloration of 
the urine is OK unless it transitions from ___, 
___ Aid to a very dark, thick or like tomato juice 
color

should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
team.  

Unless otherwise advised, blood thinning medications like

after discharge or save until your Foley catheter is removed 
(called a trial of void or void trial).
