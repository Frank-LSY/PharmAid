97.7 110 139/73 14 97% RA.

blood expressed with pressure. Foley draining dark yellow urine, 
no blood or clots. 
EXT: Warm, well perfused, no lower extremity edema

Pertinent Results:
MRI Head ___. Interval increase in size of the left cerebellar metastatic 
lesion now 
measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm with worsening surrounding edema. 
2. No new enhancing lesions identified. 
3. Stable postsurgical changes after right perioral craniotomy 
for resection of a right temporal metastatic lesion without new 
or suspicious enhancement. 

CT Chest ___
Since ___ there has been growth of some of the large 
central lymph nodes-now impinging on the esophagus and left 
atrial appendage-some growth in a few of more than a score of 
pulmonary metastases, and substantial growth in presumed thyroid 
metastases. 

CT A/P
1. Numerous solid enhancing left renal masses, largely unchanged 
compared to prior.  The largest measuring 5.6 cm. 
2. Stable appearance of metastasis in the pancreatic head and 
body and gall bladder. 
3. Partial filling defect within the left renal vein interval 
decrease in 
size.  This is possibly due to tumor extension or thrombus. 
4. Interval enlargement of left gluteus maximus and right psoas 
solid 
enhancing skeletal muscle metastasis. 
5. Splenic artery aneurysm unchanged in size.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma to the brain and lung s/p nephrectomy and 
craniotomy complicated by ___ CVA with residual 
left-sided weakness, who presents with gross hematuria.

# Hematuria: 
# Postrenal ___ in patient with solitary kidney
He developed hematuria with retention 2 days prior to admission. 
A foley catheter was placed at ___. On outpatient 
follow up ___ at ___ clinic at ___, he reported 
increased pelvic pressure and pain, so he was referred to ED. 

Bedside ultrasound demonstrated clots in the bladder. Urology 
was consulted. A 3-way catheter was placed and hand irrigated 
until urine was clear. Urine culture was negative for infection. 
He will keep the foley catheter in place and has follow up with 
outpatient urologist in 3 days. His Cr remained 1.3 on discharge 
(baseline 1). 

His gross hematuria was attributed to underlying RCC (with 
evidence of progression on surveillance CT done date of 
admission) in the setting of multiple supplements that have 
blood thinning properties (epigallocatechin gallate, 
theracurmin, Fucoidan) and high oxalate content (high dose 
vitamin C, esseac tea). Patient and family agreed to hold all 
supplements on discharge until they can discuss with urology and 
naturopathic provider as outpatient. 

At discharge his foley was draining clear yellow urine with only 
old dried blood at the urethral meatus. He was instructed to 
seek medical assistance for worsening pain, bleeding, or signs 
of infection. 

Pyridium, which was initially started for bladder spasms in the 
hospital was stopped on discharge due to concern for worsening 
___.

# Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer: Metastatic to lung and brain.
# Increase in size of cerebellar metastasis
# Progression of disease on CT scan
He was noted on surveillance MRI to have increased cerebellar 
mass (previously 2 mm and now 1 x 1 cm with surrounding edema). 
He had no clinical/neurologic symptoms. Neuro-oncology and 
Neurosurgery followed patient in the hospital. They will discuss 
his case at tumor board 2 days after discharge and consider SRS 
___ for tissue sampling. 

In regard to his systemic progression of disease: Mr. ___ has 
had slowly progressive disease and has formerly declined therapy 
due to concerns for side effects. His oncology team at ___ (Dr 
___ and primary oncologist (Dr ___ 
___ were notified of the CT findings on admission and will 
follow up as an outpatient.
