History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with history of multiple vascular risk 
factors and recent MI who presents with 10 minute episode of L 
hemibody numbness, for which Neurology is consulted.

He woke up feeling well this morning and approximately noon, 
while  standing still performing standing meditation, he noted 
acute onset of left leg numbness, followed by left arm numbness, 
followed by left face tingling.  He describes the numbness, 
which was most prominent in the left leg, as "as if it was 
asleep", "I felt like I could not control it", denies 
pins/needles, denies
weakness but states that if he placed more weight on the leg he 
may have fallen.  This is associated with lightheadedness, not 
vertigo, and no palpitations.  He was able to speak and 
comprehend speech, and had no other focal neurologic symptoms.  
The area of numbness in his left arm was more prominent along 
theulnar aspect of the lower arm.

IMAGING

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
No acute intracranial process.

CTA HEAD ___ C & RECONS; CTA NECK ___ & RECONS
1. Patent intracranial and neck vasculature without evidence for 
occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm. 
2. Mild calcifications within the bilateral common carotid bulbs 
and cavernous segments of the bilateral internal carotid 
arteries, without flow limiting stenosis. 

TTE
No specific echocardiographic evidence of cardiac source of 
embolus noted.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Transient ischemic attack: On repeat interview, patient 
described symptomatology as poor motor control of the left leg, 
followed by a 'cold sensation' in the ulnar aspect of the left 
forearm, followed by paresthesias of the left side of the face, 
progressing over the course of a few minutes and resolving 
within about 10 minutes. CT and MR imaging of head and neck did 
not reveal acute infarct, hemorrhage, or dissection as the 
etiology of patient's symptoms. Echocardiogram did not reveal 
PFO or thrombus. Due to likely TIA, prasugrel was switched to 
clopidogrel in coordination with patient's outpatient 
cardiologist, due to boxed warning on prasugrel in patients with 
a history of TIA or stroke.

Of incidental note, patient had an episode of severe subscapular 
muscle spasm on the right side prior to discharge; EKG and 
troponins were reassuring, and symptoms did not recur.

Transitional issues:
1. Patient has been previously noted to have borderline 
hyperkalemia, which had resolved by time of discharge; if 
persistent, consider switching antihypertensive agent from 
lisinopril.

1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ due to 
an episode of abnormal sensation in your left leg, face, and 
arm. CT and MRI scans of your head and neck did not show signs 
of a stroke, bleed, or vessel tear as the cause of your 
symptoms, so it was likely that your symptoms were due to a 
transient ischemic attack (TIA). As a result of this episode, 
one of your medications (prasugrel) was switched to a related 
medication (   ) on the advice of your cardiologist. Your other 
medications otherwise remained the same.

Please follow up with your primary care provider within one week 
of discharge.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

Sincerely,
Neurology at ___
