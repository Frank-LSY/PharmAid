History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Patient is an ___ y/o M with reported
diagnosis of bipolar II disorder and Crohn's disease who was BIB
___ police on ___ after endorsing SI with plan to jump in
front of a train.

"The patient endorses a longstanding history of depression
beginning in grade 9 though states that it has fluctuated in
severity over the last several years, often triggered by
"relationship issues".  He is readily engaged though vague and
somewhat circumstantial in his replies, occasionally stopping
abruptly and saying "I'm sorry, I forgot the question".  

He believes he has always been predisposed to emotional
hypersensitivity and tolerates stress poorly though he
acknowledges that the demands of his parents' high expectations
forced him to adapt, calling himself a "high-functioning 
person".
When detailing his depression he describes sustained periods of
low mood and apathy but denies difficulty sleeping or changes in
appetite; it was in ___ when he experienced his
"manic/psychotic break" that he realized that he required
assistance with his mental health.  

The patient was diagnosed in grade 12 with Crohn's disease for
which he was trialed on prednisone with adverse psychiatric
effects, describing periods of amnesia in which he would "lose
track of time", believing himself unable to form memories.  He
states that he attempted to bring this to the attention of his
father, who is supportive of him but with whom he has a
"complicated" relationship, but was told "it's just part of
growing up".  He believes that he felt better after 
discontinuing
the prednisone one year ago, with resolution of these amnestic
episodes and improvement in his baseline mood, but notes that 
his
mood changed acutely in the summertime.  

He states that during this past summer he was working ___ 
hours
daily at school with heightened energy, elevated mood, and some
element of grandiosity, feeling "fantastic".  This evolved over
the next few months with the development of magical thinking,
believing he could influence other's actions through colors and
numbers, and derealization, feeling as though he was
"disconnected from reality".  When asked about AVH he initially
denies but then concedes that he did experience "buzzing" and
"white noise" which he believes he occasionally misinterpreted 
as
angry voices.  While he denied SI during this time he did 
develop
the delusion that he was going to die on a specific date at a
specific time for a specific purpose- how, he did not know- and
prepared himself by laying in his bed and placing pennies over
his eyes.  He recalls a sense of relief when eventually 
realizing
in ___ that the time of his death had passed though felt
acutely that something was wrong and that he needed to seek
psychiatric care.  Note that the patient, who smokes marijuana
frequently, does endorse daily use during that time, and 
concedes
it may have influenced his symptoms.

After taking a leave of absence from school he returned to 
___
where his parents took him to an outpatient psychiatrist but he
did not receive care as he told his treaters he would be
returning to ___ this semester.  The patient states that he
has continued to feel "depressed" and "apathetic" after 
returning
to school ___ and has attempted to connect to outpatient
psychiatric care but has failed, "getting bumped from one person
to another".  He describes a chronic and consistent need to be
"hyperaware" of his emotions  and states that he woke up feeling
emotionally vulnerable and stressed, realizing that today, 
rather
than "fighting", he felt like "giving up"; he endorses SI with
newly formed plan to jump in front of a train referencing a 
short
story he had written about an mystery homicide/suicide in high
school.  The reason, he says, that he has not yet acted on his
thoughts is shame and the guilt he would feel on behalf of 
family
and friends he'd leave behind.  He cannot articulate clearly 
what
resulted in his presentation to the ED but states that he is in
need of help and amenable to hospitalization.

Patient denies episodes of decreased need for sleep, heightened
energy, or euphoria prior to last ___, and has not 
experienced
these symptoms since.  He denies psychotic symptoms but for the
ones above."

Course in Emergency Department (including behavior, medications
given): Patient was in good behavioral control, no medications
were started. 

On arrival to the unit, the patient provided additional history
as well as confirming the history above. He endorsed having had
symptoms that "looking back looked like schizophrenia" including
believing that he was going to die, as described above, as well
as having a belief in enlightenment and seeing patterns in 
colors
and things, and paranoia, believing the government or other
people to be following him. He endorsed very occasional AH
(believing people who were actually outside were talking to him
when they were not) and VH (seeing cockroaches when none were
there). Endorses depressed mood though denies anhedonia (but
endorses "apathy"), endorses hopelessness and thoughts of
suicide. Denies racing thoughts, reports he has been told by
others that he is speaking quickly at times. 
He described his symptoms starting after a breakup with his high
school girlfriend. He described having been brought to the ED by
his parents where he was prescribed Risperdal, but did not take
it because he did not trust his providers. He also disclosed one
episode of self-injurious behavior at age ___ when he stabbed
himself in the hand, he is not sure why.  He does not believe 
his
symptoms got any better or worse when he started his current
medication for Crohn's disease but does recall increasingly
bizarre and impulsive behaviors while on prednisone. He was 
calm,
cooperative and in good behavioral control throughout.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with reported diagnosis of
bipolar II disorder and Crohn's disease, who was brought in by 
___
police on a s12 after endorsing SI with plan to jump in front of 
a
train. On admission interview, he endorsed frequent marijuana 
use,
psychotic symptoms including paranoid and delusional thought
content as well as infrequent AH/VH, and a history of manic
symptoms such as decreased need for sleep, euphoria, and 
grandiose delusions (though denied decreased need for sleep or 
euphoria at the time of admission). Collateral was notable for 
his parents reporting that he had one prior episode they felt 
was
consistent with mania (with pressured speech, euphoria) and 
another consistent with psychosis without mania in the past, and 
for a history of manic symptoms in the context of prednisone 
use. Exam on admission was notable for patient expressing 
somewhat odd and at times delusional thought content around 
connections between events and seeing patterns in everything, 
however he did not appear internally preocuppied and is well 
related with appropriate eye contact. During his admission, a 
Personality Assessment Inventory was completed, the results of 
which were thought to be consistent with a possible bipolar 
disorder.  The differential diagnosis at this point remains 
quite broad, including substance induced psychotic disorder, 
primary affective disorder (i.e. bipolar disorder with psychotic 
features), primary psychotic disorder (i.e. schizophrenia), and 
would also consider potential medication side effects of the TNF 
inhibitor he is on for his Crohn's disease (psychiatric side 
effects have been reported from TNF alpha inhibitors in the 
literature ___ as a 
possible factor in his presentation.  He also meets criteria for 
cannabis use disorder. 

#Legal/Safety
Patient signed a CV on admission and was on q15 minute checks 
and green sharps throughout. He was in good behavioral control 
and no mechanical or chemical restraints were required 
throughout his stay. 

#Psychiatry
Given his history of psychosis, report of intermittent AH, and 
reported psychotic symptoms including experiencing "altered 
mental states" and belief in having psychokinetic abilities, the 
patient was started on risperdal 0.5 mg, which was uptitrated to 
1 mg BID, with cogentin 0.5 QHS to prevent EPS. The Risperdal 
was well tolerated with no side effects noted after some initial 
grogginess from the first dose. A lipid panel and A1C were 
checked for baseline values and were all within normal limits 
(see "labs" above). The patient denied AH during this 
hospitalization and reported that while he still had some 
thought content that he described as delusional after the 
Risperdal was started, the intensity of these thoughts was 
improved from admission. His SI resolved, which he attributed to 
his acceptance that he needed and was finally receiving 
psychiatric help as well as to the therapy and medications he 
received. At the time of discharge, he denied SI and was future 
oriented and expressed intent to follow up with his outpatient 
provider. 
A personality assessment inventory was completed with the 
patient during his stay here, and the results were felt to be 
consistent with a possible bipolar disorder. 

#Medical
#Crohn's Disease
-Patient and his parents reports that he has IM injection of 
Simponi monthly; was not due for another 3 weeks at the time of 
admission. Would recommend continued monitoring of his symptoms 
and keeping an eye on any correlation between his Crohn's 
medications/symptoms and psychiatric symptoms, as there is some 
report in the literature of TNF inhibitors causing psychiatric 
symptoms (though nothing was found in the literature on Simponi 
in particular). 

#Substance Use Disorders
#Cannabis Use disorder
The patient was strongly advised to discontinue use of 
marijuana, and counseling was provided regarding cessation. The 
patient endorsed plan to stay sober from marijuana for at least 
one year after discharge.

#Psychosocial/Milieu
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills and was often visible on the 
milieu interacting with peers. He often played guitar for other 
patients, which he reported enjoying. 

#Collateral Contacts
FAMILY MEETING
A family meeting was held on ___ at which the patient's parents 
___
and ___ (___) were present along with the patient,
 attending psychiatrist, psychiatry resident, and SW. The 
patient's parents reported their concerns about his prior 
episodes of psychotic symptoms and that the patient had
previously been prescribed risperidone and not taken it. They
discussed the importance of the patient making his own decisions
to seek out treatment and not wanting to force him into 
anything.
They also discussed their concern that if he were to take time
off from school he may need another source of structure as they
feel structure is important to him. They noted that the patient
had been having difficulty taking care of ADLs and IADLs while 
at
school (despite academic success), including not feeding himself
(he had not signed up for a meal plan) and not paying bills.  
The
patient expressed feeling that he would be unable to be healthy
if he returned to school and wanted to return home to his 
parents
to work on his mental health prior to returning to school, and
his parents expressed their support of this plan. The idea of a
possible leave of absence from school was discussed. 

The case and plan were also discussed with the patient's 
outpatient psychiatrist in ___, Dr. ___ (p 
___ on the day of discharge. 

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting risperidone and cogentin, and risks and benefits of 
possible alternatives, including not taking these medications, 
with this patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take these medications as well as the importance of 
the patient's actively participating in the treatment and 
discussing any  questions about medications with the treatment 
team, and I  answered the patient's questions.  The patient 
appeared able to understand and consented to begin the 
medications.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself and/or others based upon 
static factors including history of substance abuse (marijuana), 
male gender,  age, single status, and chronic medical illness 
(Crohn's disease) and modifiable risk factors including suicidal 
ideation with plan, psychosis, lack of outpatient treaters, and 
active substance abuse (marijuana). These were addressed during 
this hospitalization through the provision of individual, group 
and milieu therapy aimed at improving coping skills, the patient 
being started on Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication, 
counseling regarding marijuana cessation, referral to outpatient 
providers, and encouraging support from family.  Finally, the 
patient is being discharged with many protective risk factors,  
including being help-seeking, future oriented, having fair 
insight, and having extremely supportive family. Overall, based 
on the totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is 
not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to 
others.
