Imaging:
========
RUQ US:
1. Limited exam due to difficulty in based on positioning.  
Within the 
limitation, liver echotexture appears within normal limits. 
2. Cholelithiasis. 

ERCP:
The scout film was normal. 
During difficult biliary cannulation, the pancreatic duct was 
partially filled with contrast and visualized proximally. The 
course and caliber of the duct was normal with no evidence of 
filling defects, masses, chronic pancreatitis or other 
abnormalities. 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. 
Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. The CBD was 6 mm 
in diameter. 
One possible filling defect consistent with a stone was 
identified in the CBD. 
Opacification of the gallbladder was incomplete. 
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were normal. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. 
There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
The biliary tree was swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting at 
the bifurcation. One small pigmented stone was successfully 
removed. 
The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones 
were seen. 
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations:
Admit to hospital for monitoring
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated
No Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for 5 days.
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain, 
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call Advanced 
Endoscopy Fellow on call ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of HTN, GERD,
gallstone pancreatitis who presents with abdominal pain. He came
into the ED on ___, after being discharged from ___ on ___ for
presumed cholangitis and passed CBD stone. Underwent ERCP ___
with sphincterotomy and stone extraction

# Cholangitis, choledocholithiasis
Underwent ERCP on ___ with sphincterotomy performed. Small 
filling defect consistent with stone also identified. Biliary 
tree was swept. Diet was advanced and he was tolerating a 
regular diet at time of procedure. LFTs were unremarkable 
(mildly elevated ALT of 44 and AP of 215 at time of discharge). 
He was found to have enterobacter bacteremia at ___ and was 
continued on home flagyl. Home levofloxacin was converted to IV 
ciprofloxacin while hospitalized. He was continued of 
levofloxacin and flagyl at discharge

# Leukocytosis: leukocytosis of 23.7 at time of discharge, down 
from 77 at ___. Likely leukomoid reaction, but should 
have repeat CBC with diff after infection normalizes to ensure 
that this resolves

# HTN: continued home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came in because you were having fever and abdominal pain.

Please continue taking the antibiotics you were taking before 
coming into the hospital. These antibiotics are treating a 
bloodstream infection and it is very important to finish a full 
course.

Please also hold aspirin for the next 4 days. There is a risk of 
bleeding after your ERCP procedure. You should not restart 
aspirin until ___.
