accessible. Most of her supports are far from her current 
location.  She was connected with current providers and 
appointments were made.

alcohol and drugs.  We provided psychoeducation and referrals 
for her as an outpatient. She understood the risks of use and 
appears to be in the motivated stage of recovery.
