Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old man with history of 
autoimmune hepatitis (found to have stage 2 fibrosis on biopsy) 
previously on prednisone and azathioprine, now off 
immunosuppressive therapy since ___ with normal LFTs until he 
presented with transaminitis in the setting of rifampin 
treatment for anaplasmosis.

#Transaminitis: Approximately one week prior to admission, Mr. 
___ developed fever, HA, and other nonspecific symptoms 
and was found to be PCR positive for anaplasmosis. Due to a 
doxycycline allergy, he was started on rifampin 300 mg BID on 
___. On ___ he had normal liver enzymes. On ___ he had only 
slight AST elevation of 56. At next check on ___ after 11 doses 
of rifampin, he had ALT/AST 698/452 with AP 78, bili 0.6. 
Rifampin was stopped and he was admitted with admission ALT/AST 
of ___. His transaminitis was thought to most likely be 
secondary to rifampin treatment, however he was also evaluated 
for other etiologies, including autoimmune hepatitis flare ___ 
positive at 1:40, ___ negative), viral serologies for hepatitis 
(HBV and HCV negative), and EBV/CMV (CMV negative, EBV pending 
on discharge). An APAP level was negative and TSAT was not 
suggestive of hemochromatosis despite elevated ferritin at 1559. 
His transaminases downtrended off rifampin so in consultation 
with hepatology he was discharged with plan for follow up labs 
in 3 days and hepatology appointment in 5 days. 

#Anaplasmosis: Diagnosed prior to admission with negative 
babesia, ehrlichia, and Lyme. Although, doxycycline is the drug 
of choice for treating anaplasmosis, due to an allergy, he was 
started on rifampin which has only shown ___ effectiveness. 
He felt marked symptom improvement after his abbreviated course 
of rifampin (6 days). Infectious disease was consulted and felt 
that he had received adequate treatment provided that he had no 
additional infectious symptoms. Therefore, desensitization to 
doxycycline was not attempted.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for lab value abnormalities 
that indicated liver damage, which was concerning given your 
history of autoimmune hepatitis. We discontinued rifampin, an 
antibiotic that was started for your anaplasma infection which 
could have injured your liver. We consulted infectious disease 
to make sure that your infection was adequately treated. Given 
that you have not been having additional infectious symptoms 
(fever, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, 
diffuse myalgias), it was determined that you had been 
adequately treated as long as these symptoms did not recur. We 
monitored you for 24 hours to ensure that your liver tests were 
downtrending. You will need to obtain labs on ___ and every 
week after until otherwise specified to make sure your liver 
inflammation resolves. You should follow up with a hepatologist 
(liver doctor ___ below).

Do not take any Tylenol (acetaminophen) or any new medications 
without first talking with your doctor as these can cause 
further damage to your liver.

Thank you for letting us be a part of your care,

Your ___ team
