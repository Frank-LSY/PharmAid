Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
visual changes

visual field changes
 
Past Medical History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old right handed lady with history of 
BPPV,
vestibular neuritis, sensineural hearing loss, essential tremor,
pre-DM, HLD who presents with acute onset visual changes 2 weeks
ago for which she went to ophthalmology today and was diagnosed
with right homonymous hemianopia and subsequently referred to 
the
emergency department. 

She was in her usual state of health and was reading the
newspaper on ___ when she suddenly had some difficulty
"tracking the lines". She didn't think she lost her vision or 
had
missing vision. She was able to read the words but does think
there was an issue with comprehending the meaning. She has
trouble describing what she means by this. She attributed this 
to
just perhaps the small print. She was doing much better reading
larger print on her phone. She denies that she ever couldn't 
read
at all. She never had to spell the letters or say them out loud.
She has not been bumping into anything on her right and she has
been able to drive. She does not think she had any associated
weakness, tingling/numbness, memory issues, dizziness or
headache. She thinks she snores. She doesn't have palpitations.
She finally had optho appointment today at which time a dense
right homonymous hemianopia was noted WITHOUT macular sparing.
She was referred to ___.

She does report that about a year ago she had an episode of
isolated vertical diplopia lasting a minute. Per At___ records
by Dr. ___ occurred while walking down stairs. She had
had cataract surgery at some point that year. ESR and CRP were
normal. MRI brain with and without contrast, MRA brain/neck at
___ ___ showed no acute infarct, normal MRAs, tortuous
but otherwise normal vertebral arteries. TTE ___ showed LVEF
approximately 60%, trace-mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation, no shunt by color Doppler. Holter monitor ___
showed sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, occasional APBs, one
run of SVT. The transient diplopia was felt to be possible
migraine variant but given possibility of TIA, she was started 
on
ASA. Patient reports she has had several more episodes of
vertical diplopia since that initial one. The longest was 10
minute episode about 1 week ago. She woke up at 3AM and noticed
it. Seemed the same regardless if she looked right or left;
perhaps worse with her head back. This went away and was not
associated with any other symptoms. 

 
Social History:
___
Family History:
Her father had tremor and hearing loss. Father
had stroke in ___ but she thinks it was bleeding type. Her 
mother
had ___ disease with onset in the late ___. There is no
family history of migraines. She wonders if her maternal
grandmother had a stroke.

Discharge Physical Exam:
Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Her speech is somewhat 
hesitant, takes many pauses before speaking. She tends to repeat 
herself, and perseverates. Attentive, able to name ___ backward 
without difficulty. She has trouble with repetition, though this 
may have been limited by hearing (says ___ is the one to help 
today" instead of "I only know that ___ is the one to help 
today", and "the cat hit under the couch" instead of "the cat 
always hid under the couch when the dog was in the room". 
Comprehension is impaired as well, also possibly limited by 
hearing. For example, when asked to touch her finger to her nose 
(finger specified by examiner) she says "which finger" and it 
takes repetition of command several times for her to understand, 
despite the fact she has been asked to do this every day for the 
past 12 days. Her speech is halting, but normal prosody. There 
were no paraphasic errors. Able to name both high and low 
frequency objects. Able to read with difficulty very large text.

She was referred to ___.

She does report that about a year ago she had an episode of
isolated vertical diplopia lasting a minute. Per Atrius records
by Dr. ___ occurred while walking down stairs. She had
had cataract surgery at some point that year. ESR and CRP were
normal. MRI brain with and without contrast, MRA brain/neck at
___ ___ showed no acute infarct, normal MRAs, tortuous
but otherwise normal vertebral arteries. TTE ___ showed LVEF
approximately 60%, trace-mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation, no shunt by color Doppler. Holter monitor ___
showed sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, occasional APBs, one
run of SVT. The transient diplopia was felt to be possible
migraine variant but given possibility of TIA, she was started 
on
ASA. Patient reports she has had several more episodes of
vertical diplopia since that initial one. The longest was 10
minute episode about 1 week ago. She woke up at 3AM and noticed
it. Seemed the same regardless if she looked right or left;
perhaps worse with her head back. This went away and was not
associated with any other symptoms. 

Hospital Course:

She was initially admitted to the stroke service, with an 
initial NIHSS 3 and last known well 2 weeks prior to admission. 
Her exam was notable for right homonymous hemianopia, mild word 
finding difficulties, and mild right facial droop. Her initial 
MRI showed thin cortical diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal 
along the left parietooccipital lobe and possible potential 
milder signal along the right parieto-occipital lobe without 
corresponding signal abnormality on FLAIR or T2. We felt this 
was highly atypical for stroke given the lack of FLAIR correlate 
and crossing PCA/MCA territories. We evaluated for whether she 
could have an occipital seizure with an EEG. The EEG showed 
frequent delta slowing over the left temporal region, at times 
sharply contoured, with rare LRDAs. There was also asymmetric 
PDR on the left side indicating occipital dysfunction, and GRDA 
indicating mild encephalopathy, but no clear electrographic 
seizures or epileptiform discharges. Therefore, seizure was felt 
to be extremely unlikely.  We also evaluated and ruled out 
cortical venous thrombosis and PRES (no risk factors). 

She was transferred to the general neurology service for further 
workup as her presentation was not thought to be vascular in 
nature. We then considered MELAS given her history of idiopathic 
sensorineural hearing loss, and sent metabolic and genetic 
testing. Her visual symptoms continued to progress during the 
admission with denser right hemianopia, some left visual field 
involvement, and increased word finding difficulties. Repeat MRI 
showed evolving and slightly worsening findings: 
"Redemonstration of diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal 
involving the
left parietooccipital cortex, with associated decreased ASL 
perfusion in the
left occipital lobe with similar distribution and extent.  
Interval
development of subtle cortical thickening and FLAIR 
hyperintensity involving
the median occipital lobe most likely represents manifestation 
of the
perfusion abnormality." Ultimately, we felt that this would be 
an atypical presentation of MELAS given the lack of resolution 
of her symptoms, her age at presentation, and her normal lactate 
(including post-prandial lactate), CK, and minimally elevated 
pyruvate, with other labs pending at discharge. 

Given her imaging findings and predominant visual symptoms, we 
considered ___ variant CJD and sent ___ and RT-QuIC 
from the CSF, with results pending at discharge. She was also 
evaluated by Neuro-ophthalmology on ___, and her exam showed 
Right homonymous hemianopia without significant neglect in the 
setting of left parietal/occipital cortical diffusion 
restriction sparing the white matter and in a non-vascular 
distribution, simultanagnosia, and progressive cognitive 
decline, as well as right hypertropia with full ductions, likely 
decompensated phoria. 

She was initially started on ASA and Plavix given our first 
concern for stroke, and she was ultimately discharged on 
aspirin. We also started coenzyme Q10 given our concern for a 
possible mitochondrial disorder. 

She was set up with home ___, OT, nursing and social work. She 
will follow up with neuro-ophthalmology within the next ___ 
weeks. We have referred her to cognitive neurology and brain fit 
club for cognitive rehab. We also contacted her outpatient 
neurologist Dr. ___ to coordinate follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital because of difficulties with 
your vision as well as word-finding difficulties. You were 
initially admitted to the Stroke service because we were 
concerned for a stroke, but your symptoms and your MRI did not 
fit that diagnosis. You were then transferred to the General 
Neurology team. We did 2 brain MRIs, a spinal tap, an EEG, CTs, 
an echocardiogram, and multiple lab tests. These tests evaluated 
for stroke, seizure, infection, metabolic or genetic causes, and 
dementia. We are still waiting for many of the results from our 
lab testing. You were also evaluated by our Neuro-ophthalmology 
colleagues. 

At this time, we do not have a definitive diagnosis for your 
symptoms, and we need more information from the lab tests that 
are still pending. Once we have these test results back, we can 
come up with a plan for further workup if needed. 

We added co-enzyme Q10 to your medication list. This is a 
naturally occurring antioxidant that can help many metabolic or 
mitochondrial illnesses. 

We will schedule a follow up appointment in Neurology and 
Neuro-ophthalmology as below. You should not drive until your 
vision improves and you are evaluated formally by Drive Wise.  

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
Your ___ Neurology team
