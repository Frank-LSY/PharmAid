Reason for consultation: Left hand weakness
 
History of Present Illness: 
The patient is a ___ right-handed woman who presents the
ED with complaints of episode of left handed weakness and
numbness this past ___.

She states that she had previously been in her usual state of
health.  ___ was a normal day for her and she felt great.  
On
___ she worked for approximately 10 hours felt somewhat
fatigued during the day, but this is not out of the ordinary for
her after work, she went for a walk which she did without any
difficulty.  She denies overexerting herself or feeling
dehydrated.  After returning from her walk, at approximately 5
___, she was in her house when she tried to lift a bag and 
noticed
that her left arm was "totally dead", meaning that she did not
grasp the bag at all.  She then tried to grab another object on
her cutting board, and again was unable to do so.  Within a
matter of minutes, she began to feel a "pins-and-needles"
sensation in the entirety of the left hand.  There was no 
sensory
change proximally to the hand.  Within 5 to 10 minutes of this,
she developed a brief, although intense, frontal headache.  She
describes this as aching denies any throbbing sensation.  She
also denies any vision changes, photophobia, phonophobia, 
nausea.

Because she was feeling fatigued, she went to the couch and lie
down.  She napped for about 30 to 60 minutes.  When she awoke,
just before 7 ___, all of her symptoms have resolved.  She was
able to use her hand without difficulty.  She did feel that her
energy level was somewhat less than usual.  She met up with some
friends for dinner, though because she was not feeling well she
went home early.  She went to bed at around 11 ___.

Since that time, she is continued to have a host of various
complaints.  At times, she feels dizzy or "foggy".  She feels
like she is speaking slower and taking longer to respond to
questions.  She is also had some nausea and decreased appetite. 
Apparently, some of her clients at work noticed that she seemed
to be somewhat subdued.  Over the weekend, she continued to feel
fatigued and mostly wanted to lie down.  As she is being
evaluated by her primary care doctor for hypertension, she
checked her blood pressure a few times.  Over the weekend, it 
was
as high as 190/98.  Last night it was 160 systolic.

She called her PCP today, who recommended she present to the
emergency department.  Currently, she continues to feel somewhat
fatigued and slow to respond.  She thinks her left side may not
be as strong as usual, but has a hard time describing what
exactly is weak.

She does endorse a history of occasional palpitations but has no
history of atrial fibrillation.
 
Review of Systems: 
On neurological review of systems, the patient denies confusion,
difficulties producing or comprehending speech, loss of vision,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. 
 
On general review of systems, the patient denies recent fever, 
chills, night sweats, or recent weight changes. Denies cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, palpitations. 
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal
pain.  Denies dysuria, or recent change in bowel or bladder

Imaging:
=========
CT/CTA head and neck
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Linear noncalcified curvilinear filling defect along the 
posterolateral
left carotid bulb at the origin of the left extracranial ICA is 
consistent
with a carotid web.
3. Otherwise normal CTA neck. No ICA stenosis by NASCET 
criteria.
4. Moderate changes of chronic white matter microangiopathy.
5. Minimal calcified plaque, right supraclinoid intracranial 
ICA, not causing
luminal narrowing. Otherwise normal CTA head. No large vessel 
occlusion. No
aneurysm.
6. Biapical solid pulmonary nodules measuring 1-2 mm. No 
specific imaging
follow-up is indicated. Other incidental findings, as above.

MRI: 
===
1. no evidence of mass, hemorrhage or recent infarction.
2. Punctate chronic infarct, left cerebellum.
3. Brainstem T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are nonspecific but 
compatible with
sequelae of prior ischemic injury or prior 
inflammation/infection.
4. Moderate to severe changes of chronic white matter 
microangiopathy.
5. Bilateral partial mastoid effusions.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old woman with a history of hypertension 
who presented to the ED after an episode of left hand weakness 
and numbness, which was accompanied by headache. The episode 
resolved after approximately 60 minutes but she has continued to 
experience various symptoms including fatigue, malaise, 
dizziness, etc since that time. 

#TIA/Arm weakness:
Exam on admission was remarkable for only slightly slow finger 
tapping on right and then discharge exam with only right finger 
extensor weakness. CT/CTA with minimal atherosclerosis with 
extra-cranial L carotid web (which would not explain left arm 
symptoms). MRI showed periventricular white matter changes 
consistent with chronic microvascular disease but no stroke with 
possible chronic L cerebellar infarct none of which fit her 
symptoms. By description, her episode seems consistent with a 
TIA. Atypical migraine is possible, though she does not have a 
history of migraine. A1c was 5.3, LDL 136. She was started on 
aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily. 
She had TTE which showed EF 69%. No ASD or left ventricular 
thrombus seen. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic 
function. Ziopatch was given on discharge. She will follow-up 
with stroke neurology in ___ months. 

[ ] Continue aspirin 81 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg daily
[ ] F/u with Stroke Neurology with Dr. ___ in ___ 
months.
[ ] Ziopatch (heart rhythm monitor) placed at discharge, results 
of this will be communicated to Dr. ___ who ___ 
reach out to you. 

#Hypertension:
As patients blood pressures were elevated to 130s-170s 
systolic, therefore we initiated her on lisinopril 2.5 mg daily. 
After receiving one dose in the morning, it was noted that her 
blood pressure decreased to 100s/60s over the course of the day 
and she reported dizziness with the lower blood pressures. 
Therefore we discontinued her lisinopril and recommend that the 
patient checks her blood pressures at home and at her PCPs 
office. If her blood pressures are persistently elevated more 
than 140/90 mmHG then she should be started on 
antihypertensives.

[ ] Check Blood pressure and follow up with PCP if elevated 
persistently >140/90 to initiate on anti-hypertensives.

==============================================

Transitional Issues
===================

[ ] Follow up with your PCP for blood pressure check and repeat 
cholesterol check in 3 months. 
[ ] Continue aspirin 81 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg daily
[ ] F/u with Stroke Neurology with Dr. ___ in ___ 
months. If you do not hear back, call ___ to make this 
appointment. 
[ ] Ziopatch (heart rhythm monitor) placed at discharge, results 
of this will be communicated to Dr. ___ who ___ 
reach out to you.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to the hospital because you had weakness in your left 
hand that resolved.

When you were in the hospital you had an MRI of your brain which 
showed you did not have a stroke.

It is possible that your symptoms represent a migraine aura. 
These could also represent a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA). 
TIA is a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is transiently blocked by a clot. The 
brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the 
other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being 
deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of 
symptoms.

TIA/Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you 
for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having 
stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify 
those risk factors. Your risk factors are:

[ ] High Cholesterol
[ ] High blood pressure

Please note, we prescribed you blood pressure lowering 
medication lisinopril 2.5 mg, after receiving one dose your 
blood pressure decreased and you became dizzy, therefore we have 
discontinued this for now. 

We are changing your medications as follows:
[] Start taking aspirin 81 mg daily to prevent strokes
[] Take atorvastatin 40 mg daily to decrease cholesterol

[] Check your blood pressure at home and at your PCP's office. 
If this is persistently above 140/90 mmHg, you may need 
blood-pressure lowering medications. Therefore, please follow up 
and discuss this with your PCP.

[ ] Follow up with your PCP for blood pressure check and repeat 
cholesterol check in 3 months. 

[ ] Follow up with Stroke Neurology with Dr. ___ in 
___ months. If you do not hear back, call ___ to make 
this appointment.
 
[ ] Ziopatch (heart rhythm monitor) placed at discharge, results 
of this will be communicated to Dr. ___ who ___ 
reach out to you. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
