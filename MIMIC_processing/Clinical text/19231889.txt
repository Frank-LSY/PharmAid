History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ ___ incarcerated man
with history of chronic right arm and neck pain, who presented

___ interpreter. 

He was in his usual state of health, in prison, when at ~6:30PM
he developed sudden-onset right hand weakness. He says that he
also had numbness in his right arm and neck, however these 
appear
chronic per outside reports, and it was not possible to clarify

interpreter. There were no vision or language problems. He says
that last week he had an episode of numbness in his right leg as
well. He was taken to ___ at 7:45PM and received 
tPA
at 9:15PM. His hand weakness greatly improved, however he
continued to complain of hand numbness. MRI was performed and
showed small subcortical infarct in the left frontal lobe
(~corona radiate). CTA was also performed.

Echo:The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen 
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with 
maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
global systolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the 
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe 
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at 
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion.  

OSH MRI:  small left frontal
subcortical infarct, as reviewed by Stroke Attending

CT at 24 hours: 
1. No intracranial hemorrhage. 
2. Small infarct in left frontal lobe on outside hospital recent 
MRI is not 
well visualized on this unenhanced CT. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted for RUE weakness, s/p TPA ___. His OSH MRI with 
L Corona Radiata Infarct. His 24 hr NCHCT was stable, without 
hemorrhage or hemorrhagic conversion. Etiology was likely 
cardioembolic. 

For stroke workup: CTA H/N without flow limiting stenosis. A1c 
5.5%, LDL 118, for which he was started on Atorvastatin. Tele 
without Afib during stay; unable to discharge with a holter as 
it is a weekend. Echo: 65% EF, ___. Formal OT recs 
pending, but likely outpatient OT. 

He was discharged back to his facility.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of Right hand weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
Aspirin 81 mg daily 
High Cholesterol

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

 Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care 
physician.  

 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
