History of Present Illness:
___ is an ___ old woman with a complex medical
history who presents from home after a fall during an episode of
vertigo today. She is accompanied by her so who provides much of
the history.

Ms. ___ was last in her normal state of health this morning.
She got up and had breakfast with her daughter and was feeling
well. Her daughter left and she was alone, sitting on the couch
watching the news until about ___ ___. She got up and as she was
walking, she fell. She does not think that she tripped or lost
consciousness, but cannot recall the details. Her son relayed to
me his impression from his initial conversation with his mother,
which ___ that she had the onset of a severe vertiginous feeling
and felt that as she fell she might get flung off the balcony, 
so
intense was her sensation of spinning. Once she was on the 
floor,
she tells me that she had very severe vertigo as if everything
was moving around her and she had to hold onto the table leg and
close her eyes. She vomited multiple times. She screamed for 
help
but no one heard her. Over the course of an unclear period of
time, her vertiginous sensation "slowed down" but did not
completely resolve. She decided to try and be calm since no one
could hear her and she thinks she ended up falling asleep. 
Around
___ her daughter came back to check on her and found her on the
floor, covered in vomit. It seems that she was alert and briskly
responsive, able to talk, without obvious deficits. They brought
her to the emergency department.

Here, she was hypertensive to the 150s and afebrile. Her vertigo
had largely improved. She was able to stand to transfer to a
wheelchair for going to the bathroom, but was unusually unsteady
on her feet. She says she feels "normal" but refuses to get out
of bed; her son believes she looks tired. Her symptoms have
vastly improved.

Nothing like this has happened before. She had a URI with a 
cough
two weeks ago which had resolved. She wears hearing aids at
baseline and has not noticed any change in her hearing. 

Her son gave me an outline of her complicated neurologic 
history.
In her ___ she was hospitalized for months for a brain abscess
which was "in the middle of her brain." He thought that her
vascular malformations may have placed her at risk. She was
treated with antibiotics and with intervention that affected
"eloquent brain areas" responsible for her fine motor control,
and they were told that she would not read or drive ever again.
She was successfully treated and was able to regain function in
reading. She then had a stroke about ___ years ago. The
semiology was not being able to move either arm, and "she could
only move one finger on one side" He recalled seeing an MRI that
showed "where the brain was deprived of oxygen, but atypical, 
not
in an area near a blood vessel." THe search for an etiology was
apparently fruitless and she was transferred to ___ for
rehab, where she regained much of the strength in her arms.
Finally, she had an episode several years ago where she was at a
restaurant and lost consciosness "as if she were dying" and the
etiology was thought to be vasospasm of a vessel in her neck.

At baseline, she lives alone. She has some difficulty with short
term memory. She  sometimes confabulates. She no longer wants to
choose things (such as picking from a menu when out at dinner.)
She ambulates without a cane or walker at home; when she is out
she is always leaning on someone's arm. She is nervous about her
gait. She has not had any recent falls. Earlier this year she
fell and had trouble getting back up to a standing position. She
has weakness in her arms and legs. Her arms are tremulous with
movements, although it apparently improves if she is doing
something purposeful. Her son feels that she has been becoming
more "feeble" over the past few months. She has apparently been
restricting her diet because she is worried that she is
overweight, which he thinks is contributing to this recent
change. Finally, over the past ___ years he has noticed a 
gradual
but steady decline in her cognition.

Neurologic ROS and ROS were notable as above, otherwise negative
or non-contributory.

###Discharge Exam###
Upon discharge, she was awake, alert with fluent speech and at 
times frontal. She was moving all extremities antigravity with 
similar baseline weakness as described above. She has bilateral 
postural and intention tremor R>L. 
 
Pertinent Results:
___ Head CTA
  
  
1. Multifocal encephalomalacia from multiple prior infarcts and 
sequela of 
chronic advanced microangiopathy, as described. 
2. No acute intracranial abnormality, without CT evidence of 
acute territorial 
infarct or hemorrhage. 
3. Patent intracranial and neck vasculature. 
4. Focal cortical prominent tangle of vessels within the 
posterior left 
frontal middle gyrus which is contiguous with a prominent M4 
segment middle 
cerebral artery and demonstrates a dilated draining vein, 
suspicious for a 
pial versus small parenchymal arterial venous malformation. 
Given this 
finding and history of pulmonary arterial venous malformations, 
consider 
genetic associations for multiple vascular malformations. 
Recommend follow-up 
with interventional neurosurgery. 
5. Segmental beaded appearance of the bilateral superior 
cervical segment 
internal carotid arteries, likely due to fibromuscular dysplasia 
rather than 
atherosclerosis, given the absence of significant 
atherosclerosis within the 
remaining vasculature. 
6. Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring, right greater than 
left, with 
calcification in traction bronchiolectasis. 
7. Numerous thyroid nodules with a dominant left cystic and 
solid nodule 
measuring 2.6 x 1.4 cm. Recommend dedicated thyroid ultrasound 
for further 
characterization per the ___ College of Radiology 
guidelines. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S): Recommend follow-up with interventional neuro 
surgery for 
further clinical management of a suspected left frontal vascular 
malformation. 
Recommend dedicated thyroid ultrasound to further characterize 
multiple 
thyroid nodules, if not previously worked up. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
MS. ___ was admitted after an acute onset episode of vertigo 
and emesis. On exam, she was found to have R torsional 
horizontal nystagmus on R gaze. Upon admission, vertigo 
resolved. 

CTA revealed L frontal AVM and possible subtle signs of a 
fibromuscular dysplasia of her carotid arteries. This location 
would be difficult to visualize with a carotid US. There does 
not appear to be any moderate or high grade stenosis in this 
location. 
She will follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient given 
intracranial AVM. 

MRI was unable to be obtained because she had multiple coils 
placed in her lungs, and the prior operative note did not detail 
the type of all coils placed, so it was unclear if they are MRI 
compatible. Given possibility she had a cerebellar stroke versus 
peripheral vestibulopathy not able to be determined without 
imaging, her secondary stroke prevention was optimized with ASA 
81mg and atorvastatin 20mg. 

LDL 129, A1C 5.4. She was monitored by telemetry without 
arrhythmia. Echocardiogram could be obtained as an outpatient. 
Her BP remained mostly SBP 110s-140s. After stairs she had 
increased BP to 180 that immediately improved with rest to 150s. 
She will be working with home ___, but we discussed with family 
to monitor BP during activity to prevent spikes given known AVM. 
She will follow up with PCP this week for BP check. 

She was evaluated by ___ who felt she was safe for discharge to 
home with 24 hour supervision, home ___, and rolling walker. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. Start ASA 81mg and atorvastatin 20mg. Follow-up with 
neurology.
2. Follow-up with neurosurgery for evaluation of AVM. 
3. Renal US as outpatient to evaluate for fibromuscular 
dysplasia
4. Outpatient echo ordered. 
5. Monitor BP, goal is normotensive (not currently on home 
antihypertensive but could be initiated PRN by PCP).

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of room spinning resulting 
from a possible ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood 
vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by 
a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- High cholesterol 
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
Start aspirin 81mg and atorvastatin 20mg
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.  

 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
