Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with h/o asthma, depression who presented with 
one-day history of increasing left-sided neck pain, urinary 
incontinence, left-sided upper and lower extremity weakness, and 
left-sided facial, upper and lower extremity numbness after a 
motor vehicle accident.

ACUTE ISSUES  
# Left sided weakness/Numbness  
# Left sided pain/muscle spasm: Patient had left sided 
weakness/numbness after motor vehicle accident on ___, 
was evaluated at ___ with normal ___ and shoulder imaging and 
discharged home. He then presented to the ___ ED with pain, 
weakness and numbness in his left arm and leg, as well as left 
sided neck spasm. Given involvement of upper extremity and face, 
upper cervical/brainstem/cortical lesion was most likely. 
However, MRI/MRA of the brain and MR of the cervical spine in 
the ED did not show any acute neurologic injury.  Pt was seen by 
neurology who reviewed imaging and agreed that there was ___ 
clear cause for his sxs and presentation could be consistent 
with worsening radiculopathy following MVA.  Numbness, pain and 
weakness improved throughout the course of the hospitalization 
with pain medication and anti-spasmotics and he was discharged 
to rehab. At time of discharge, he had ___ strength in all his 
extremities. 

# Urinary incontinence: Patient reported urinary incontinence at 
home, as well as an episode of incontinence in the ED and 
another while inpatient. Bladder scan showed accumulation of 
urine to 625 cc. Patient was straight-cathed x2. He had ___ MRI 
evidence to suggest central neurologic process for cause of 
symptoms. Patient's urinary retention may be due to opioids he 
received while in the hospital. By the end of his hospital stay 
patient was able to void independently.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
# Depression: Patient was continued on home Zoloft 100mg qdaily.

# Psychosocial stressors: Patient is currently homeless. 
Furthermore, his wife and children suffered multiple injuries in 
MVA. A social worker met with the patient to offer resources and 
contacts regarding disability and housing.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

You were admitted with weakness, numbness and pain on the left 
side of your body, as well as urinary incontinence, after being 
in a motor vehicle crash on ___. A full clinical 
neurological exam and imaging of your brain and spine, did not 
show any evidence of acute trauma. You had painful muscle spasms 
that we treated with several medications to decrease pain and 
relax the muscles. You had urinary incontinence so a catheter 
was inserted into your bladder to drain the urine. The catheter 
was removed on ___. You had one further episode of incontinence 
and a catheter had to be inserted twice to drain urine from your 
bladder. Your urinary incontinence did not appear to be due to 
neurologic damage. It may have been a side-effect of the opioids 
you received for pain. You were able to urinate on your own by 
the end of your hospitalization.

Moving forward, it is important that you:
1) Take all of your medications as prescribed
2) Attend all of your appointments as scheduled

You will go to a rehabilitation facility after this 
hospitalization to regain your strength and mobility.

We wish you a speedy recovery!

Sincerely,

Your care team at ___
