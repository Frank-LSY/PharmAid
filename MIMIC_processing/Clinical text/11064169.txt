Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ male with no significant past 
___ history the presents for chest pain with exertion, with 
positive exercise stress test in the emergency room, underwent 
cardiac catheterization that showed nonobstructive coronary 
artery disease, now pursuing medical management of CAD.

Transitional Issues:
==================
PCP:
[ ] Consider intiating warfarin given patient's history of 
provoked thrombus. 

CARDS:
[ ] ASA, atorvastatin started for secondary prevention of CAD
[ ] Started amlodipine for hypertension and anti-anginal effect
[ ] ECHO showed mild AR and very mild WMA that should be 
followed

=============== 
ACTIVE ISSUES: 
=============== 
# CP, possible unstable angina 
Pt presents with 10 days of new onset exertional cp in the
setting of a family hx of early CVD; w/u notable for negative
cardiac biomarkers but STD in lateral leads on ETT. Cor angio
without any obstructive disease but mild CAD. Will discharge on 
medical management, including aspirin, atorvastatin 40 qPM, and 
amlodipine 5 mg daily. 

# Deep venous thrombosis in ___, unprovoked, now status post
six months of warfarin therapy and currently not on AC per pt
preference
# heterozygous for the prothrombin gene mutation (2-fold
increased risk for DVT)
# heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation (7-fold 
increased
risk for DVT)
Had a D-Dimer for 450, so low suspicion for PE as cause of chest 
pain symptoms
