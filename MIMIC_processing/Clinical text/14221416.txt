# Transaminitis
# Abdominal pain: Improving but with fluctuating clinical 
course.
significant transaminitis, predominantly of hepatocellular
pattern. Given presence of cholelithiasis on gallbladder
ultrasound, waxing and waning pattern, mild CBD dilation on U/S,
tan stools, choledocholithiasis is high on the differential. She
may have passed a stone already given clinical and laboratory
improvement. Clinical picture at this point does not fit
cholangitis, despite the fact that she got unasyn at ___ and
zosyn x 1 in the ED, given lack of fevers, leukocytosis, and pt
does not appear toxic
 -follow blood cultures. re-culture if febrile and low threshold
to start ABx coverage for cholangitis
 -GI/ERCP consulted and following, given MRCP showing
cholelithiasis but no choledocholithiasis, and her clinical
picture consistent with passed CBD stone, recommend surgical C/S
for cholecystitis. no need for EUS/ERCP
 -Surgery evaluated the patient and took to OR for lap chole on 
___ (see below hospital course while on surgical service)
 -acute hepatitis serologies negative for hepatitis A/B/C
 -normal coags, normal mentation. normal lipase and lactate

# Pyuria: UA with positive blood, ___, WBC, RBC. likely due to
contamination from menstruation. asymptomatic except for 
slightly
darker urine which may be due to biliary obstruction
 -UCx resulted in lack of significant growth. received
ceftriaxone for empiric coverage prior to culture results
returning. d/c'ed ABx yesterday

# Chest pain/SOB: episodic, prior to presentation, associated
with anxiety, similar to her previous panic attack episodes.
non-exertional. not likely to be cardiac in nature.
 -currently asymptomatic. EKG wnl, NSR, no ST-T segment changes

The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which went 
well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note 
for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the 
patient arrived on the floor tolerating. The patient was 
hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You presented to the hospital with abdominal pain. This was
initially located in the epigastrium and right upper
quadrant.  Your liver enzymes were elevated, and a right upper 
quadrant ultrasound showed cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. 
You underwent an MRCP on ___, which showed cholelithiasis 
without any evidence of acute cholecystitis. GI was consulted 
and concluded that there is no need to undergo an ERCP. An MRCP 
confirmed the diagnosis, and for this reason you underwent a 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. You tolerated the procedure well 
and are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with 
the following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

you did before, unless you have been told differently.

take, please call your surgeon.
