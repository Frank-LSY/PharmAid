History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old man with pmhx of depression, erectile
dysfunction and HLD who presents with acute onset diplopia, gait
instability and difficulty with speech which started around 
08:45
am this morning. Pt reports that he woke up this morning and was
in his usual state of health, went downstairs to eat a 
___
breakfast sandwhich and sat down to watch TV with his wife when
he noticed the image in the TV appearing double. Describes it as
images being next to each other. Did not try to cover either eye
to see if this would resolve diplopia. He denies any nausea,
emesis, vertigo, headache, numbness or focal weakness during 
this
episode. No loss of vision. His wife noticed that he sounds
funny, talking more slowly and mumbling. He himself did not
notice any change in his speech. His wife called his sister who
is a nurse who recommended to call EMS. When EMS arrived MR.
___ was noted to have a mildly unsteady gait, but did not
veer to any particular direction and did not fall. He states 
that
he sometimes in the past gets blurry and at times even double
vision but this usually resolves within a few seconds to minutes
but has never been as sustained as this time. 
In the ED a code stroke was called, NIHSS was 0. His symptoms 
had
completely resolved. CTA head and neck negative for acute
intracranial process, patent vessels. 
Of note he took sildenafil last night and was recently started 
on
Fluoxetine (4 weeks ago) for depression.  

On neuro ROS as in HPI, the pt denies headache, loss of vision,
dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing
difficulty. Denies focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty
with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted for stroke workup after a transient 
episode of diplopia and difficulty speaking (unclear aphasia vs 
dysarthria), all of which had resolved on presentation to the 
ED. MRI brain was without infarct. Echo was without intracardiac 
thrombus. He was monitored on telemetry throughout admission 
without tachyarrhythmia, and was discharged with 30 day cardiac 
monitoring. 
Stroke risk factors: LDL 146, HbA1c 5.6%, TSH 2.3. He was 
started on ASA 81 daily and atorvastatin 40 qhs. His exam was 
normal at the time of discharge, without focal deficits. 
He will follow up with PCP and stroke neurology. 

Stroke risk factors include: 
HLD with LDL 146 not previously on statin therapy
borderline hypertension. 

=================================
Transitional Issues: 
[ ] PCP: ___ BP over time and monitor for development of 
hypertension. ___ LDL and adjust statin as needed to obtain goal 
LDL <70
[ ] Neurology: ___ cardiac monitoring, and consider extended 
monitoring if negative.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of transient double vision 
and trouble speaking resulting from a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, 
a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
High cholesterol
Borderline hypertension
  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
Start baby aspirin (81 mg daily)
Start a cholesterol medicine, atorvastatin. 
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Neurology Team
