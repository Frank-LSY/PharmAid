History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ right handed woman with a previous
smoking history who presents for evaluation of cerebellar
infarcts on a brain MRI.

Over ___ on ___ she was sitting at
the table with her family after having a couple of drinks when
she had sudden onset of loud buzzing in her left ear. She stood
up and felt unsteady, falling into things on her left. Her 
family
looked for a facial droop and didn't see one. She tried to touch
her nose and missed, touching her forehead (she thinks she tried
only with the right hand). She held her arms out in front of her
and they shook up and down but didn't drift downward - instead
her right arm drifted upward. She had no slurred speech. All of
her symptoms resolved in ___ minutes and she attributed them to
an inner ear problem since she had a recent URI with a middle 
ear
effusion. She went to bed. 

The following day while waking across the street to her
neighbor's house she began suddenly veering leftward. She sat
down to have a drink of water but that trouble coordinating
reaching for the glass (doesn't remember which hand). She tried
to stand up again but was unable to coordinate walking and would
have fallen without assistance. She describes feeling like she
was very drunk. Her speech was slurred. These symptoms lasted
___ minutes. She presented to urgent care who referred her to
the ED. A ___ was done and unremarkable. She was admitted
overnight, had carotid dopplers done (also unremarkable per the
patient) and saw a neurologist the following day who recommended
a brain MRI. Given that it was a holiday weekend, she was unable
to get an inpatient brain MRI and opted to have an outpatient
brain MRI rather than waiting until after the holiday for an
inpatient brain MRI. She was started on aspirin and has 
continued
to take this. She saw her PCP who ordered the brain MRI, which
showed bilateral cerebellar infarcts prompting referral back to
the ED. She also had an outpatient TTE with bubble, which did 
not
show a PFO or other stroke source. 

Currently, she has a mild frontal headache and some subtle
difficulty with talking but otherwise feels back to baseline. 
She
has chronic neck pain which she attributes to sitting at a
computer all day. She sees a chiropractor for this.

hemispheres.  No signs of hemorrhage.  Most significant 
abnormalities on MRA of the head except for small size the 
vertebrobasilar system.  MRA of the neck can be obtained with

detection of acute infarct. 
  
___ TEE; Patent foramen ovale. No ___ thrombus. No aortic 
atheroma. 

___ ___: 1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the 
right or left lower extremity veins. 
2. Left ___ cyst

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ woman admitted ___ for bilateral 
cerebellar infarcts. On exam, she has no dysmetria or cerebellar 
rebound. She still has some mild dysarthria that is only 
noticeable to people to who know her. CTA head/neck negative for 
vertebral dissection. Given her negative outpatient TTE and the 
fact that she is young and stroke distribution suggestive of 
embolic source, she will need a TEE to evaluate the cause of 
stroke. TEE showed patent foramen ovale. Bilateral lower 
extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT, as was MRV pelvis. 
She was discharged home with a 30 day holter monitor to evaluate 
for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She will follow up in clinic 
to discuss risks and benefits for PFO closure. 
Hypoercoagulability workup will also be completed as an 
outpatient. 

Stroke Workup:
- stroke risk factors: LDL 120, HbA1c 5.2%
- TTE: negative for PFO/clot
- MRI: bilateral cerebellar strokes
- CTA head/neck: no dissection
- TEE: +PFO
- ___: negative for DVT
- MRV pelvis: negative for DVT
- hypercoagulability workup: pending

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of ataxia resulting from 
an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a 
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms. 
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- PFO
- high cholesterol
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- aspirin 81mg daily  
- atorvastatin 40mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

It was a pleasure taking care of you, and we wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
