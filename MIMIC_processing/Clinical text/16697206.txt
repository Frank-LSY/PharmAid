CXR IMPRESSION:  
  
Low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities may be secondary to 
atelectasis noting 
that infection is not excluded. 

CTA IMPRESSION:  
  
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.  No evidence of 
pneumonia. 

___ CATHETERIZATION REPORT
Coronary angiography: right dominant
  LMCA: The LMCA was very long with mild plaquing.
  LAD: The LAD had a S shaped double hairpin turn mid vessel. 
The
distal LAD was tortuous before wrapping well around the apex.
There were minimal luminal irregularities in the LAD.
  Ramus intermedius: There was a large tortuous ramus 
intermedius
with minimal luminal irregularities.
  LCX: There was slow flow in the LCX consistent with
microvascular dysfunction. The origin was extremely retroflexed
followed by a hairpin turn into the major tortuous OM/LPL and 
the
AV groove CX. The LCX vessels had minimal luminal 
irregularities.
  RCA: There was initial catheter-induced spasm when the AL1
engaged the RCA deeply. This resolved after withdrawal of the
catheter and IC TNG. There was a loop in the mid-distal RCA. The
RPDA was quite tortuous. The RPLs were mildly tortuous. Flow in
the RCA was quite slow, consistent with microvascular
dysfunction.

Assessment & Recommendations
 1. No angiographically-apparent flow-limiting CAD, but diffuse
slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction
 2. Tortuous epicardial coronary arteries consistent with
hypertensive heart disease.
 3. Mild-moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction when
assessed post-angiography.
 4. No high grade stenoses to suggest STEMI; clinical scenario
more consistent with pericarditis.
 5. Tortuous right subclavian artery.
 6. Routine post-TR Band care.
 7. Cycle biomarkers to assess for myopericarditis.
 8. Additional plans per Dr. ___ the ___ team.
 9. Reinforce primary preventative measures against CAD.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with history of gastric MALToma, pre-diabetes, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia presented with substernal chest 
pain radiating to her back, worsened with deep breaths found to 
have CTA negative for pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
syndrome, with initial EKG concerning for PR depression with 
negative troponin. The patient was admitted to work-up other 
potential causes of the pain as well as rule out for acute 
coronary syndrome. Her pain resolved on admission to the floor 
but recurred in the setting of tachycardia when walking back 
from the bathroom the night of admission. EKG showed 
non-specific ST changes and PR depressions concerning for 
potential STEMI and the patient was emergently cath'd via radial 
access. There were no major occlusions suggestive of STEMI w/ 
possible evidence of microvascular disease, but given clinical 
senario and EKG findings, strong suspicion for pericarditis. Pt 
started on course of indomethicine, colchicine and discharged in 
stable condition to outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___ in 
Cardiology clinic with an ECHO cardiogram to further evaluate 
the heart before this appointment.

#Chest pain: Atypical sounding chest pain in patient with no 
known cardiac disease. Has cardiac risk factors (HLD, HTN, 
Family Hx). Last stress test negative in ___. Initially CP free 
on admission but re-developed substernal chest pain after 
ambulating to the bathroom which did not resolve on its own with 
EKG changes including ?STE with PR depressions. Pain was 
pleuritic but not positional. Given her risk factors and 
continued pain in the setting of EKG changes, pt emergently 
cath'd. (Cath Report in Results Section). Pt diagnosed with 
acute pericarditis and was started on Indomethicin/Colchicine at 
discharge. Discharged in stable condition to f/u w/ Dr. 
___ with ECHO prior to visit on ___.
 
#HLD: 
-Continued home simvastatin 10 mg PO daily

#HTN:
-Continued lisinopril/HCTZ 20 mg-12.5 mg daily

#GERD:
-Continued Omeprazole 20 mg PO BID

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Ensure resolution of sx w/ NSAID + Colchicine treatment at f/u 
appointment

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure treating you at ___ 
___. You were admitted with concern for your chest pain. 
During your admission, you were monitored on telemertry and 
bloodwork was performed which was reassuring. You had a 
recurrence of your pain and your electrocardiogram showed 
changes which were concerning, so you were taking for emergent 
cardiac catheterization. This procedure showed no major 
blockages, making the diagnosis of inflammation of the sack 
surrounding your heart or 'pericarditis' likely. You were 
observed overnight with no issues on monitoring. Its important 
that you follow-up with Dr. ___
