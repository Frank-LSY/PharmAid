IMAGING
=======
NCHCT ___: 
1. No acute intracranial process. 
2. Hypodensities in the left occipital lobe may represent a 
subacute or chronic infarction.  No prior available for 
comparison.

CTA HEAD AND NECK ___:
1. A 0.3 cm inferiorly oriented aneurysm in the proximal right 
A2 anterior 
cerebral artery. 
2. No evidence for stenosis, occlusion or vascular malformation. 

3. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, which can be seen 
with pulmonary artery hypertension. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S): There is a multi nodular thyroid gland with 
no dominant nodule identified which meets criteria for imaging 
follow-up according to the ___ College of Radiology 
guidelines. 
 
NCHCT ___: 
1. No evidence for large acute territorial infarct on 
noncontrast head CT. 
2. Unchanged appearance of left occipital hypodensity, likely 
representing 
subacute to chronic infarct. 

CXR ___: 
Chronic scarring, volume loss and pleural thickening in the left 
lung 
partially imaged on recent CTA neck and stable since ___. No 
acute pneumonia. 

ECHO ___: 
No ASD or LV thrombus seen. Normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild to moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared with 
the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of 
___, mitral regurgitation is more prominent and there is 
pulmonary hypertension.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ F with a history of HTN, HLD, MCI, and 
depression. She initially presented with a chief complaint of 
acute onset of L homonymous hemianopsia as diagnosed by her 
neuro-ophthalmologist in clinic. Code stroke called and she had 
an NIHSS of 1 for L visual neglect. Her symptoms improved to 
normal while in the ED. She was admitted for stroke work up due 
to concern for a small infarct in the occipital lobe. 

Hospital course by system: 

NEURO: Presented with transiesnt LT homonymus hemianopsia as 
documented above. She was imaged with serial NCHCTs as MRI head 
was poorly tolerated due to claustrophobia. She appears to have 
a chronic LT PCA infarct which is not consistent with her 
clinical presentation. We believe the etiology of her 
presentation is likely a RT PCA stroke or TIA. We have assessed 
her stroke risk factors: fasting lipid panel Chol 250/LDL 161, 
HBA1c 5.3, TSH 2.1. Started Plavix in the setting of previous GI 
bleed as discussed with PCPs office. She does have an extensive 
history of myopathy with statins (tried Lovastatin, Simvastatin, 
brand name ___, and most recently pravastatin 20mg which 
caused diarrhea). After discussion with her family we have 
started low dose rosuvastatin. We are recommending an open MRI 
for better characterization of her pathology. 

CV: She has a known history of palpitations currently on 
atenolol 75mg. She has documented holter monitoring in the past 
w/o any clear evidence of arrhythmias. We have monitored on 
telemetry without alarms. Cardiac enzymes trended and negative. 
She had a TTE with no evidence of clot or ASD.  We are 
recommending outpatient cardiac monitoring with ___ of 
Hearts. 

GI: Has a history of prior GI bleed with melena requiring 2 
units PRBC in ___. Presumed gastritis due to ASA use. However 
she had a documented H pylori infection which was treated. 
Discussed with PCPs NP who noted no clear documented 
contraindication for antiplatelet agent. She was started on 
Plavix ___.

TOX/METAB: Checked LFTs which were WNL. Urine and serum tox 
screens negative

ID: Initial UA with bacteriuria which was asymptomatic. CXR with 
no acute findings (see imaging section for full report).

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================
1. Consider open MRI.
2. Started on Plavix and low dose rosuvastatin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
  
___ were hospitalized due to symptoms of  transient left visual 
field loss concerning for an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. However, we have imaged ___ with serial 
head CTs and found no evidence of an acute stroke. The MRI is a 
better method to see these but it was not well tolerated due to 
claustrophobia. We recommend an outpatient open MRI to follow. 

We have also performed an echocardiogram which showed no 
evidence of clot or abnormal communication between your heart 
chambers. ___ will need outpatient cardiac monitor with ___ 
___ Hearts. 
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed ___ for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are: high cholesterol. We are 
changing your medications as follows: adding Plavix to decrease 
your stroke risk, and adding Rosuvastatin to decrease your 
cholesterol.

Instructions:  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with your primary care physician as listed 
below.  
If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
___  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
