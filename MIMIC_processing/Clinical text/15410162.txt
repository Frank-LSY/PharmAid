History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of EtOH use

this severe, has always self resolved, and has never caused
vomiting. This is his fourth episode. He denies jaundice, dark
stools, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers

Imaging:
========
RUQ US:
1. The gallbladder is distended with wall edema and gallstones. 
These findings may represent cholecystitis however they also may 
be
seen in acute hepatitis.  HIDA scan may be obtained for from 
evaluation if
clinical suspicion remains. 
2. Minimally prominent common bile duct measuring 8 mm. 
3. 5 mm nonobstructing left renal calculus.  No evidence of 
hydronephrosis. 

HIDA:
Homogeneous uptake of tracer in the liver without excretion into 
the biliary tract or small bowel with activity in the heart, 
consistent with severe hepatocellular disease. 

MRCP:
The gall bladder again appears distended with wall edema and
gallstones.  This appearance is slightly similar to the 
abdominal
ultrasound ___.  In the right clinical context, this
could reflect acute cholecystitis but is not specific. 
Combination of fasting state and sequela of hepatic 
hepatic parenchymal abnormality could explain the findings. 
2. Choledocholithiasis with secondary mild intrahepatic and
extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  The enhancement pattern 
of
the liver seems more likely to reflect parenchymal disease than
ascending cholangitis. 
3. Heterogeneous early enhancement pattern of the liver more
suggestive of underlying hepatic dysfunction and/or inflammation
than cholangitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a history of EtOH use 
disorder who presents with acute onset of epigastric abdominal 
pain (in the setting of several episodes of
the same), now resolved, found to have a marked hepatitis AST 
>>> ALT, elevated bili, ALP, with many gallstones and 
gallbladder edema on ultrasound. This is likely consistent with 
alcoholic hepatitis. He was also found to have 
choledocholithiasis.

AST: ALT ratio was > 2:1 on admission suggestive of possible 
alcoholic hepatitis. AST was ___, somewhat higher than expected 
for alcoholic hepatitis but he also reported ongoing Tylenol 
use, 2g per day. MDF was < 32 with no indication for steroids. 
He was counseled extensively on alcohol cessation.
In terms of alternate causes of hepatitis, his HAV and HCV 
serologies and HBV serologies were consistent with prior cleared 
infection. ___ and AMA were negative and SMA was only weakly 
positive at a 1:20 titer.
RUQ was notable for gallbladder wall edema and cholelithiasis. 
Gallbladder wall edema was felt to be secondary to underlying 
hepatitis. He had no fevers, leukocytosis, or ongoing pain 
suggestive of cholecystitis.
Bilirubin peaked at 5.8, likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis 
as well as some element of obstruction secondary to 
choledocholithiasis.
He had an MRCP which revealed multiple CBD. He then underwent 
ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction.

On ___, the patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 
which went well without complication (reader referred to the 
Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in 
the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor tolerating clears, on 
IV fluids, and oralanalgesia for pain control.  The patient was 
hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and were 
found to have acute cholecystitis and gallstones blocking your 
bile duct. You underwent an endoscopic procedure to remove the 
stones from your ducts (ERCP). You were then taken to the 
operating room and had your gallbladder removed 
laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and are now 
being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
