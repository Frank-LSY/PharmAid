History of Present Illness:
___ F with PMH of immunoglobulin deficiency, osteopenia,
hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency who
presents to the ED with persistent cough and SOB after oral
antibiotic treatment for multifocal pneumonia. 

She was diagnosed with pneumonia by her PCP ___ 2 weeks ago 
iso
SOB and cough. She was given 5 day course of Levaquin and
completed another 9 days of augmentin. However she has been
having persistent cough with initially yellowish and now clear
sputum, dyspnea making conversations and minimal exertion
difficult, and generalized fatigue and weakness limiting her
activities of daily life. She has had serial CXRs that showed
progressive compromise of bilateral lower lobes as well as CT
that confirmed these findings. Given lack of symptomatic 
response
she was directed to the ED for IV abx management. She was also
noted to be hypoxic at her PCP office today prior to ED 
referral.
She works with the elderly so potentially has had sick contacts.
No recent travel or hiking/bug bite exposure.

IMAGING

TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest ___
  
COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.  
when compared to priors, there has been no significant interval 
change.  There 
are persistent bibasilar opacities, with somewhat more rounded 
configuration 
at the left lung base.  Opacity at the left lung base is 
certainly not 
improved and if anything slightly larger.  Right lung base 
consolidation 
however appears slightly improved.  Superiorly, lungs are 
essentially clear 
besides mild biapical scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
within normal 
limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch. 
 No acute 
osseous abnormalities 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Persistent bibasilar opacities, potentially slightly improved on 
the right 
though potentially slightly worse on the left when compared to 
prior.

K-5.2 Cl-102 HCO3-27 AnGap-___ F with PMH of immunoglobulin deficiency, osteopenia,
hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency who
presents to the ED with persistent cough and SOB after oral
antibiotic treatment for multifocal pneumonia, admitted with
concern for fungal vs. hypersensitivity pneumonia. 

Transitional Issues:
[] follow up with pulmonary for final results of bronchoscopy 
and further management, outpatient PFTs
[] monitor bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy
[] Repeat thyroid function studies given elevated TSH 

# Dyspnea
# Productive cough: 
Admitted for treatment of presumed multifocal pneumonia after 
failed oral antibiotic therapy of augmentin and Levaquin. Given 
that patient had a more subacute course of dyspnea and cough, 
had been afebrile, and was clinically well appearing suspicion 
for bacterial pneumonia was low and antibiotics were 
discontinued after discussion with infectious disease and 
pulmonary. Additional studies and bronchoscopy were obtained to 
evaluate for possible etiologies of an
underlying indolent disease include fungal infection, organizing 
PNA, eosinophilic PNA, etc. 
While some studies were still pending, upon discussion with 
pulmonary the likely etiology was determined to be inflammatory 
pneumonia and the patient was started on PO steroids with plan 
for follow up in pulmonary clinic in ___ weeks. 

#Hypogammaglobulinemia: 
Patient with a history of mild IgE deficiency, Ig levels 
obtained herewere within normal limits. Unlikely to be playing a 
role in patient's respiratory symptoms. 

# Rash: Patient with punctate erythematous, raised lesions 
clustered in the mid back. Pruritic in nature. Her husband does 
not have the same rash. Denied recent outdoor activity or bug 
bites. Likely bug bite vs contact dermatitis, pruritus was 
relieved by Sarna lotion. Recommended patient follow up with PCP 
if rash does not continue to improve.

# Lymphadenopathy: 
Patient with large bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy. 
Patient notes her prior doctors have documented this. Likely 
larger now iso reactive inflammation from pneumonia. Will need 
close outpatient monitoring in next 6 weeks for
resolution or improvement 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: 
====================== 
# Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated to 7 here likely iso infection, 
as appears
asymptomatic. We continued levothyroxine 50mcg daily. Will need 
to repeat in 6 weeks given acute illness

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,  

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WERE YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and 
cough with concern for hard to treat pneumonia.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- We had a low suspicion for a bacterial pneumonia and we 
consulted pulmonary and the infectious disease doctors who 
agreed.
- You had a bronchoscopy with the pulmonary team to evaluate 
your lungs and take samples. 
- We ruled out a bacterial pneumonia and instead think you have 
a type of inflammatory pneumonia. The studies for this were 
still pending at discharge, but the decision was made to start 
you on steroids and have you follow up with the pulmonary 
doctors.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AFTER YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Continue to take all your medicines as prescribed below. 
- Show up to your appointments as listed below.

We wish you the best!  

Sincerely,  

Your ___ Team
