Service: MEDICINE

Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, dyspnea
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
___ with obesity, sleep apnea and prior tobacco use who now
presents with chest & radiating L arm discomfort x1 day, in the
setting of an abnormal stress test and DOE for the past month. 

She says that at her prior baseline she could walk 3 miles per
day without difficulty, but that for the past month or so she
gets very winded even with walking down a hallway and has to 
take
a break. In this context she was referred to a cardiologist, who
had her undergo an exercise EKG about a week ago which was
notable for inducible ischemic changes in an inferior
distribution (just SOB but no chest/arm discomfort during the
stress test). She had PFTs at the time which were normal. 
___
she underwent a repeat exercise stress test, this time with EKG
and TTE. The EKG showed similar inferior wall ischemic changes,
she became dyspneic but not with chest/arm discomfort, and TTE
did not show any definitive inducible wall motion abnormalities
but image quality was poor such that inferior wall was not well
visualized. 

She went home after the stress echo and later that evening, at
rest/out of the blue, she began experiencing a mid-sternal 
"chest
tightness" with pain radiating to the left upper arm. Not
accompanied by SOB. Lasted for hours on end, nothing seemed to
make it better or worse, and she did not sleep well as a result.
She came to the ED around mid-day, and ___ when she was 
given
ASA and nitroglycerin in the afternoon, she reports that both
meds helped (they were given at different times) in reducing her
pain, which at this point is all but gone entirely. ROS positive
for feeling sweaty along with the chest discomfort, but without
nausea.

Stress test: ___ at BID-N
CONCLUSION: Average functional exercise capacity for age and 
gender. Ischemic ECG changes with no symptoms to achieved 
treadmill stress. Suboptimal visualization of the basal 
inferolateral walls to interpret but otherwise no 2D 
echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to
achieved workload of all other segments. No Doppler evidence for 
a change in left ventricular filling pressure with exercise. 
Normal resting blood pressure with a normal blood pressure and a 
normal heart rate response to achieved workload. Unable to 
assess baseline PASP. Stress PASP normal. If high clinical 
concern for ischemia of basal inferolateral walls could repeat 
with contrast.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT: ___
IMPRESSION:   
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins.
 

CHEST XRAY: ___
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with OSA, obesity and 35-pack-year smoking history who 
presents with 24 hours of chest/L arm pain following an abnormal 
exercise stress test, in the absence of cardiac biomarker 
elevation, concerning for unstable angina.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,  

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  

 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==========================  
- You presented to hospital due to chest pain and shortness of 
breath. Based on EKG and labs results, you did not have a heart 
attack however the stress test imaging warranted a cardiac cath. 
We planned to have you go for the procedure today however due to 
scheduling it was feasible. You wanted to go home and come back 
electively early next week for the procedure. You were offered 
the option to stay however I understand you want to go home. 
Please take it easy at home. No working out or any strenuous. If 
you have chest pain, try nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a 
medication that can be used as needed for chest pain. If you 
develop chest pain, place 1 tablet under the tongue and allow it 
to dissolve. If after 5 minutes you are still having chest pain, 
you can repeat this every 5 minutes for UP TO 3 doses. If chest 
pain persists after 3 doses, call ___. You should always lie 
down if you need to take this medication, because it can cause a 
drop in your blood pressure which can lead to lightheadedness or 
possibly cause someone to pass out if blood pressure drops too 
low. Even if your chest pain resolves, you should contact your 
cardiologist to inform them of your symptoms.   

 
 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
 ================================  
Continue your current medications with the following changes:
- START aspirin 81 mg for presumed coronary artery disease. This 
keep the platelets from sticking to vessel wall and causing a 
heart attack.
- START atorvastatin (Lipitor) 80 mg every night (best absorbed 
when taken in the evening), this medication not only reduces 
cholesterol, but has been shown to help decrease risk of heart 
attack in the future for people who have coronary artery (heart) 
disease.  
- START metoprolol succinate 25 mg every night. This medication 
belongs to a class of medications known as Beta Blockers. Beta 
blockers slow the heart down and can lower blood pressure. They 
help reduce the amount of work the heart has to do, and can help 
to reduce risk of future heart attack.
- START nitroglycerin as needed. See blurb above.
Written drug information has been provided to you.

The cardiac cath scheduling nurses should call you at home to 
discuss the date and time of the procedure and will go over pre 
procedure instruction and what medications to take or hold the 
night before and morning of your procedure.
 
If you were given any prescriptions on discharge, any future 
refills will need to be authorized by your outpatient providers, 
primary care or cardiologist.  
 
It was a pleasure participating in your care.  
 
If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your hospitalization or are experiencing any 
symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need 
to return to the hospital, please call the ___ HeartLine at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner.
