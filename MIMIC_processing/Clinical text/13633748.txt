PERTINENT STUDIES:
==================
___ Imaging CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXIL 

IMPRESSION:  
1. Amorphous soft tissue centered in the left mandibular body 
with underlying 
osseous destruction and extensive surrounding subcutaneous soft 
tissue 
edema/stranding and skin thickening. Findings could represent a 
neoplastic 
process (likely metastatic), post radiation changes, or 
infection.  
Asymmetrically thickened left retromolar trigone is concerning 
for disease 
involvement. No rim enhancing fluid collection is identified. 
2. Paranasal sinus disease including chronic inflammatory 
changes of the 
right maxillary sinus. 

Pt discharged on same day, no new labs or studies for discharge. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with PMHx of T1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of 
the left retromolar trigone and synchronous carcinoma of the 
left parotid presenting with asymmetric left greater than right 
jaw swelling. A CT scan of the mandible raised suspicion for 
abscess for which he was started on IV unasyn and discharged on 
PO augmentin, as well as possibility of delayed post-radiation 
changes v metastatic neoplastic lesions. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
============================
[ ] Pt's INR was supratherapeutic to 3.9 on day of admission, so 
his INR was held. He was instructed to hold his warfarin for the 
day after discharge and get his labs rechecked on ___. 
He will need warfarin dose adjustment after this

[ ] Mr. ___ was started on IV unasyn and converted to PO 
augmentin for 2 weeks. His last day will be ___

[ ] Please ensure he is seen by the ___ Oral Surgery/___ 
department and ENT department (Dr. ___ soon after completion 
of his antibiotics. 

[ ] Needs BMP in 1 week to follow up on unclear baseline renal 
function. 

[ ] Given unclear renal function, his lisinopril was held at 
discharge. BP were well controlled without lisinopril.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============================
# Left mandibular body swelling: 
Asymptomatic besides external swelling. CT mandible 
demonstrating bony involvement, c/f osseous destruction, iso 
metastatic neoplastic process, post-radiation changes, or 
infection. CRP elevated, was started on IV unasyn and discharged 
on PO augmentin for a ___NT and OMFS saw the 
patient and ultimately decided he will likely need biopsy after 
completion of his antibiotic regimen. 

# ?___ v CKD
Unclear serum creatinine baseline, admitted with Serum Cr of 
1.6, discharged at 1.5; Last Cr from ___ years ago 1.0. Would 
continue to monitor regularly. 

# Afib: 
INR supratherapeutic on admission to 3.9; Warfarin was held for 
the day he was admitted. He was given strict instructions to get 
INR drawn on ___ and discuss w/ his PCP regarding 
warfarin dosing. He will hold his warfarin until then. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
==========================
# Anemia: approximately at to just below his baseline. Likely 
represents AOCD.
# Gout: currently asymptomatic. Continue allopurinol
# HTN: Continue norvasc and terazosin. Lisinopril held given 
unknown baseline renal function. BP were well controlled without 
it. It was held at discharge.
