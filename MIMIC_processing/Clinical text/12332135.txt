Chief Complaint:
Lumbar Spinal Stenosis. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ - LAMINECTOMIES & FUSION L4-L5 

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ pleasant female.  She had a fall
about ___ years ago and she started having low back pain
radiating to the left leg.  Left leg is the major problem, but
low back pain especially with weight and loading is getting much
worse.  She also has some problems with her left hip.  Epidural
steroid injections initially lasted for two to three months. 
Now, they do not last more than two to three weeks.  She has 
done
physical therapy twice so far and it relieves temporarily, but
then symptoms are coming back.  No bowel or bladder problems. 
Got an MRI of the spine and she is coming for a neurosurgical
evaluation.  Good strength in both lower extremities except the
left L4 is ___.  SLR negative for radiculopathy.  Sensory is
normal to light touch.  She does feel some pain and numbness on
the left L4 distribution, however.  Range of motion of the hips
is eliciting some pain on the hip on the left, but nothing on 
the
right.  SI joints are fine.  I reviewed the MRI of her lumbar
spine and it clearly shows about 10-mm spondylolisthesis at
L4-L5, which is clearly causing moderate central canal stenosis
and compression of the exiting L4 nerve roots as well as the L5
nerve roots.  Flexion/extension x-rays of her spine that were
done about a year ago showed 11 mm slip, which is an angulation
that changes from flexion to extension, which is indicating
instability.  At this point, the patient will definitely benefit
from L4-L5 laminectomies and fusion.  Risks and benefits were
discussed and she wants to go ahead with that for ___ as
proposed.  We will take care of it.
 
Past Medical History:
-lumbar degenerative joint disease 
-arthritis
-gout
-laparotomy for ectopic pregnancy
-LTL

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:

Gen - NAD, NCAT, AxO x3
Neuro/MSK -
PERRLA, EOMI, CN2-12 intact
BUE - 
Strength ___ throughout, SILT in all distributions, warm and 
well perfused

BLE - 
Strength ___ throughout w/ ___ L IP, hamstring, SILT in all 
distributions, warm and well perfused, improved radiculopathic 
pain on L side but still present 
 
Pertinent Results:
___ - Lumbar Spine X-Ray:
The available images show steps related to posterior 
decompression and 
stabilization at L4-L5.  Pedicle screws and vertical rods are 
in-situ on the last available image.  There is at least grade 1 
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, similar in degree when compared to 
the preoperative MRI.  Moderate disc space narrowing at this 
level.  No fracture seen.  Please see the operative report 
further details. 

___ - Lumbar Spine X-Ray:
Postsurgical changes. 
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 with respect to L5 and L4-5 disc 
space narrowing 
noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: The patient was taken to the operating 
room on the day of admission, ___ and underwent a L4-5 
laminectomy and fusion. Intraoperatively, the patient sustained 
a CSF leak. A hemovac was placed. The hemovac was removed on 
___. A LSO brace is at bedside. The foley catheter was 
discontinued. On ___ she begin experiencing asymptomatic 
tachycardia in the 110-130s.  The patient continued to receive 
oxycodone ___ mg q4 PRN for pain and 1000 mg acetaminophen q8 
PRN. She was bolused twice with 500 cc NS on ___ as she was dry 
continued to be tachycardic in the 100s.  She continues to have 
residual radiculopathic pain in her LLE but states it has been 
improving daily.
