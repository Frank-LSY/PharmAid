DISCHARGE LABS:

MRCP:

1. Cholelithiasis without specific MR evidence of acute 
cholecystitis.  
Nonspecific gallbladder wall edema is likely third spacing of 
fluids related 
to other underlying systemic process.  If there is persistent 
clinical 
concern, a HIDA scan may be obtained for further evaluation. 
2. No biliary ductal dilatation or choledocholithiasis. 
3. Multiple hepatic hemangiomas, the largest measuring up to 4.5

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted with acute cholecystitis and markedly 
elevated liver enzymes that was suspicious for biliary 
involvement. He was empirically started on ampicillin-sulbactam 
IV. The ERCP team was consulted, who recommended an MRCP. MRCP 
was obtained, which showed Cholelithiasis, but no involvement of 
the biliary system. Therefore, the patient was kept on 
antibiotics for two additional days, with downtrending of his 
liver function tests and complete resolution of his abdominal 
pain. He then received a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on ___, 
which he tolerated without complication. He was able to tolerate 
a regular diet, and was discharged with no additional 
medications (no need for further antibiosis). He will follow up 
with both his PCP for ___ repeat LFT check, and the general 
surgery clinic.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with cholecystitis (inflammation of your 
gallbladder), and very high liver enzymes. We were initially 
concerned that your biliary system might have been affected; 
however, it appears you likely had a stone that passed through 
on its own. We treated you with antibiotics, and then removed 
your gallbladder (a cholecystectomy). You will follow up with 
your PCP ___ ___ weeks and recheck your liver enzymes at that 
time. You will also see the surgeons in ___ weeks.

ACTIVITY:

feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.

throat during surgery.

unappealing.

away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.

not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.

prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
