R hand XR ___
Mildly displaced intra-articular fracture involving the
anterolateral aspect of the distal radius.  Severe degenerative
changes of the first CMC joint. No dislocation.

CXR ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service on ___ 
after a fall sustaining right sided rib fractures and a right 
wrist fracture. You were seen and evaluated by the hand surgery 
team who recommended non-operative management with a splint. You 
were seen and evaluated by physical therapy who recommend 
discharge to home to continue your recovery. 

Please note the following discharge instructions:

Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the 
Emergency Department for any of the following:
*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or 
tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your 
medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, 
or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid 
heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a 
bowel movement.
*You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your 
urine, or experience a discharge.
*Your pain in not improving within ___ hours or is not gone 
within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is 
getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or 
back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern 
you.

Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically 
advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take 
any new medications as prescribed.

Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times 
per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. 

Rib Fractures:
* Your injury caused Right sided rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).
