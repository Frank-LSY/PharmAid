IMAGING:

CT Abdomen/Pelvis (___):
1. No radiographic evidence of pancreatitis.
2. Focal fatty infiltration of the liver.

EGD (___):
Impression:
Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations:
- No findings to explain abdominal pain
- Follow-up biopsies
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with past history of idiopathic pancreatitis 
presents with abdominal pain and elevated lipase concerning for 
recurrent pancreatitis, now w/ normalized labs, negative CT and
EGD.

# ABDOMINAL PAIN / PANCREATITIS:
Lipase elevated to 431 on admission, now normalized. Initial 
presentation consistent with pancreatitis, though unclear why 
symptoms continue to persist at this point. Negative workup
including RUQ ultrasound, CT abd/pelvis, and EGD. There may be 
some component of patient/family anxiety that something worse is 
going on. Patient's father had friend who died of pancreatic
cancer after delayed diagnosis and this may be driving some of 
the anxiety. However, patient does seem to have very real 
symptoms which may not be entirely explained by pancreatitis. 
Normal EGD rules out PUD/gastritis. Patient's diet was advanced 
and she was tolerating full liquids at the time of discharge. 
Her symptoms were ultimately felt to be due to pancreatitis plus 
perhaps R lumbar muscle spasm. She will need to follow up with 
her outpatient gatroenterologist (Dr. ___ for consideration 
of further testing for idiopathic pancreatitis vs other 
functional GI causes that could explain her pain.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Please follow-up EGD biopsies.
[ ] Please evaluate patient further for causes of idiopathic 
pancreatitis, including genetic screening. This will likely be 
done by Dr. ___ patient's outpatient gastroenterologist.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted because 
of abdominal pain. We found that you had pancreatitis, though 
your symptoms were more severe than expected based on laboratory 
findings and could be explained by other causes as well. 

We performed a CT scan of your abdomen/pelvis, as well as an EGD 
(upper endoscopy), both of which were entirely normal, as well 
as a pelvic ultrasound.

Please continue to see your outpatient GI doctor to further 
evaluate why you have these episodes of abdominal pain.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
