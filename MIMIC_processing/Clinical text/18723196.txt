Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to evaluate your abdominal pain which was 
caused by a gallstone blocking your bile duct. This was removed 
and bile is now flowing freely. 

The bile duct opening was snipped to widen it, and you had some 
bleeding which stopped. Because you had some bleeding, we are 
holding your warfarin until tomorrow. 

Tomorrow morning, please take your regular dose of warfarin. 
Please also take a shot of Lovenox in the morning and again in 
the evening. Continue twice daily Lovenox and once daily 
warfarin.

On ___, go to the ___ clinic to have your INR 
drawn. The clinic will manage your injections and warfarin 
dosing from there.

Finally, you have a urinary tract infection. The antibiotics you 
have will treat that.
