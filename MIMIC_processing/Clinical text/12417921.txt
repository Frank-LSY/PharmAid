History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old left handed woman with past history
of hyperlipidemia off medications who presents to ___ ED as a
code stroke for transient visual loss as well as persistent
non-vertiginous lightheadedness.  Per the patient's report, she
was in her usual state of health today when meeting with the
president of her non-profit ___.  Around 1300hrs she 
was
working at a local ___ while balancing her checkbook 
when
suddenly her vision in the upper left field became grey and
blurry.  She did not close one eye to determine whether the
phenomenon was bilateral.  She tried to look in different 
fields,
however, the deficit persisted.  She stood up and noted that she
was lightheaded (non-vertiginous) and noted to the copy shop
staff who questioned whether she was alright that she just 
needed
to step out for some air.  She noted that she could see the 
faces
of the other people in the shop.  

She also noted that the field blurring which may have extended
past the superior left quadrant seemed to improve within 30
minutes.  After walking outside she determined that she should
leave and be evaluated.  She was able to ambulate to her car and
drive home, however, as her lightheadedness and left arm still
did not feel entirely right, she presented to ___ for further
evaluation.  The arm and hand when questioned further were noted
to be vaguely weak although this had also resolved.
 
On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, diplopia, dysarthria,
dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal
weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation

IMAGING:

CT/CTA head/neck ___:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
2. Question approximately 1 mm right proximal M1 segment 
aneurysm versus 
infundibulum. 
3. No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm, dissection or 
vascular 
malformation, or significant luminal narrowing. 
4. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the 
detection of acute 
infarct. 

MRI Head ___:
1. No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute infarct. 
2. Mild presumed sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease and chronic right cerebellar hemisphere lacunar infarct. 


ECG ___:
Sinus rhythm. Prominent voltage in leads I and aVL for left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy. Low precordial lead voltage. Compared to the 
previous tracing  of ___ the rate has increased. Otherwise, 
no diagnostic interim change.  
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old left handed woman with a history of 
HLD who presented with transient LUQ visual field obscuration 
described as "broken glass appearing" that resolved after a few 
minutes. Her vision in that quadrant subsequently continued to 
be blurry for hours, including during neuro ED evaluation. The 
morning after presentation, her vision complaints had resolved 
and she had a normal exam. She also developed a mild headache 
that morning, which is unusual for her. 

# Visual Field Obscuration:
Given the description of the vision symptoms, this is most 
likely a migraine aura although her symptoms did not progress 
across her visual field and her headache was many hours later. 
TIA also remains on the DDx. Given this is a new migraine 
phenomenon in a ___ year old woman, MRI head was obtained, which 
ruled out stroke. Stroke risk factors were assessed and she was 
started on aspirin 81mg daily given the possiblity of TIA.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- LDL was mildly elevated at 122 with an elevated total 
cholesterol of 221. We discussed with her to change her diet to 
reduce carbohydrates and saturated fatty acids. We recommend to 
recheck another lipid profile. If this still shows elevated LDL, 
then a statin therapy might be indicated; 
- HbA1c was pending at the time of discharge. She can follow up 
with her PCP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the Stroke service at ___ after a 
transient episode of blurred vision on the left side, associated 
with lightheadedness and a feeling of weakness in your left arm. 
Your symptoms all resolved rapidly except for the 
lightheadedness. To rule out a stroke, we performed an MRI of 
your brain which showed no stroke. Your symptoms were most 
likely caused by a complex migraine - i.e. a migraine aura 
without any associated headache. It is also possible that you 
had a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or mini-stroke, which did 
not leave you with any permanent deficits. To protect against 
stroke in the future, we started Aspirin 81mg daily. 

We also checked your stroke risk factors. Your LDL was mildly 
elevated at 122 and your A1C (blood sugar) was still pending at 
the time of discharge. 

We have scheduled an appointment for you to follow up with 
Neurology (Dr. ___ as an outpatient. See below 
for details. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
