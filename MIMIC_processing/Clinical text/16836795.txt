IMAGING REPORTS:

___ EMG
IMPRESSION:
Normal study. There is no electrophysiologic evidence for a 
polyneuropathy
involving large diameter sensory or motor fibers (including 
AIDP). Based on
single fiber EMG and repetitive nerve stimulation studies, there 
is no
electrophysiologic evidence for a disorder of neuromuscular 
transmission.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
___ year-old woman with history of fatigue, weakness, and
hypophonia since ___ diagnosed with "myasthenia-like
syndrome" with negative myasthenia antibody profile, POTS,
gastroparesis, SIBO who presented to the ED with reports of
progress weakness, dyphagia, and weight loss.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Malaise NOS
Patient presented reporting that she was unable to eat for a few 
days prior to arrival, endorsed 10 lb weight loss over 1 month, 
paralysis of muscles of mastication when attempting to chew. She 
was extensively worked up in the past without a clear cause of 
dysphagia. Bedside swallow evaluation showed a safe 
oropharyngeal swallow with no clinical signs/symptoms of 
aspiration or penetration. Labs showed normal electrolytes, 
vitamins and minerals, thyroid function, and adrenal function. 
Neurology was consulted and EMG was normal, recommended 
outpatient tilt-table testing. Psychiatry recommended a focus on 
nutrition and ___ with outpatient follow-up. Patient was unable 
to tolerate barium swallow. Dobhoff tube was offered but the 
patient was unable to tolerate. Patient was advised to increase 
her PO intake with supplemental drinks and to advance to solids 
as tolerated.

# Generalized Weakness
Patient presented endorsing generalized weakness and stiffness, 
hair loss and dry skin, cold extremities with exertion, 
occasional abdominal pains, and several bowel movements daily. 
Medical workup did not show a clear medical cause including 
electrolyte, neuromuscular, endocrine, or intoxicant causes. 
Patient reported exhaustion from minimal activity. Neurology was 
consulted and recommended tilt-table testing after normal EMG. 
Psychiatry recommended a focus on nutrition and ___ pending a 
complete medical workup.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Needs to follow-up with Neurology for tilt-table testing.
[ ] Needs to follow-up with Rheumatology for autoimmune workup.
[ ] Needs to follow-up with Psychiatry. Our Psych department 
will not book apt for pts unless they have a BI pcp. If they do, 
pts must call the department themselves to do an intake over the 
phone before any apt is booked. If they ___, we refer them 
back to their PCPs for help.
