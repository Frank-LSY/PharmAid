Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ old male admitted with LUE weakness after 
waking from a overdose of heroin. He was admitted to the 
neurosurgery service while under arrest in police custody.

#LUE weakness: MRI without contrast showed soft tissue swelling 
and prevertebral fluid collection concerning for possible 
abscess or infection and disc protrusion is seen at C6-C7 
resulting in moderate spinal canal narrowing. Patient was 
advised to wear a cervical collar on admission. He was fitted 
appropriately however refused to wear the c-collar despite 
education surrounding the importance. Patient was started on 
robaxin and tramadol for pain with good effect. A MRI Cspine was 
obtained showing the prevertebral fluid collection appeared to 
be post-traumatic in nature and not typical for infection. There 
was no evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis seen. There was a 
left sided disc herniation at C6-C7 which does not explain for 
the weakness throughout much of his left arm. This left arm 
weakness is more likely due to a brachial plexopathy and can be 
managed outpatient with follow-up in 1 month and EMG if his 
symptoms do not improve. He was evaluated by OT and fitted for a 
pre-fabricated L wrist splint for his wrist drop. An MRI brain 
was also negative for infection and showed and incidental 
finding of a small retro cerebellar arachnoid ___ cisterna 
magna. 

#Retained BB:
A retained BB was removed from the patient's left index finger 
by the orthopedic hand team at the bedside so the patient could 
undergo his MRI. Dissolvable sutures and a gauze dressing were 
in place upon discharge. The dressing ___ be removed on ___. 

#Scaphoid:
A fracture through proximal pole of the scaphoid was 
incidentally found on xray for evaluation of the BB in the 
patients L finger. Ortho hand evaluated the patient and the 
imaging and feel that the fracture is chronic. The patient does 
not need to be in a cast or splint for the fracture and was 
instructed to follow-up in the ___ clinic in 2 weeks for 
further evaluation.
