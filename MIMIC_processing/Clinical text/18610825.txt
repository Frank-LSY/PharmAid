History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ yo M with PPHx of depression, one past 
SA
by wrist-cutting, no past inpatient psychiatric 
hospitalizations,
who presents to the ___ ED via EMS after texting his 
girlfriend
about recently worsening depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Pt reports that without a clear precipitant, since 2 weeks ago,
he experienced worsening of depressed mood, "feeling trapped",
sleep disturbance (sleep initiation issues lasting up to 2 hours
falling asleep, and up to 2 nighttime awakenings), decreased
appetite with 15 lbs weight loss, "losing motivation" to not 
even
really performing ADLs such as showering/brushing teeth, and
having passive suicidal thoughts. Energy has been "depleted" for
the 2 weeks, has been feeling worthlessness (not feeling he's 
cut
out for many things which he objectively knows he is doing okay
in such as his academics), and poor concentration (difficulty
focusing/studying). 

He also shares that in the past 2 weeks, he has had severe
new-onset anxiety, keeping him up at night (worrying about
"everything"), with panic attacks in the past 4 nights during
which he experiences chest tightness, dyspnea, uncontrollable
crying, diaphoresis, and some nausea, lasting as long as 2 
hours.

He reports feeling alone and not being able to talk about these
issues with anyone except his girlfriend who has been in ___
since ___ for a study abroad program. He was on the phone
texting her for about one hour talking about these symptoms, and
then he fell asleep for about 30 minutes which he assumes led to
his girlfriend becoming concerned that he was doing something to
hurt himself. She called ___ and they knocked on his
door, and then he was brought to ___ via EMS.

Pt states that the previous time he struggled with depressive
symptoms was ___ years ago when he started freshman year in
college. He saw a therapist and a psychiatrist when he returned
home during the summer at that time who offered ongoing therapy
and initiating antidepressants; he did not follow-through with
them as he felt that his sxs got better and reports that since
then until the past 2 weeks, he felt relatively stable and able
to perform in school. 

Currently reports mood as "anxious", does not have any
psychopharm/therapy providers in the area, and family is in ___
and is unable to be with him to monitor him until he can attend
outpatient follow-up appointments. Identifies his girlfriend as
the only other person he can open up to and feel comfortable
about discussing these topics, but she remains in ___.

Also of note, pt initially remained very pleasantly minimizing 
of
his current situation, describing the scar on his L wrist as
having been a superficial SIB last summer, but once I ask to go
through his text messages with girlfriend to clarify if there 
are
any other safety concerns, he becomes tearful and states that he
has not been honest and he has had tried to commit suicide in 
the
past and that the scar on his wrist was from trying to kill
himself with a hunting knife last summer. He also shares that he
may be doing worse than he initially presented the sxs, stating
"actually it's pretty bad, the anxiety and depression have been
really bad" and states that he has had recurrent passive SI of
"things would be better if I'm not around", and although anxious
is amenable to the idea of receiving inpatient level of care."

Per Dr. ___ with parents on way up to ___ from 
___
"Spoke w/ his father ___ ___ and mother ___, who 
were
in transit on their way to ___, they were both surprised that
___ was in the ED, I described to them that a friend of his
called campus security because they were concerned about him. 
His
parents mention that ___ was communicating with them as if
nothing has occurred or was wrong." 

Per Dr. ___ ___ collateral note
"Received phone call from ___ asking for update on patient; I
wasn't sure if we had discussed with patient providing
information to ___. 
___ said that patient is not known to their counseling 
center.
___ police were called by a friend of the patient last night
saying that patient had expressed SI in a phone call and text
message. Patient denied this to ___ police but after speaking to
EMTs, agreed to go to hospital for psychiatric evaluation.
___ asked that ___ be kept updated of patient's status; I told
her that we discuss with him what information he felt 
comfortable
sharing with them.  Her phone number is ___

In the ED, patient was calm cooperative. Received Ativan 1mg
Ativan at 1300." Significant time spent with patient and family
discussing inpatient hospitalization. Patient and family
initially opposed to hospitalization. ___ paperwork
explained in addition to process of paperwork on arrival to 
unit.
Concern for missing schoolwork and classes discussed at length.
Patient and family in agreement with plan prior to transport. 

On interview on arrival to the unit, patient reports that he
presented to the hospital due to escalating anxiety and
depressive symptoms secondary to psychosocial stressors
(intensity in school). Patient reports that he felt increasingly
helpless, isolated and while texting a close friend who is
currently living in ___, he stated that he had thoughts of
wanting to end his life. Patient denies plan or intent. His
friend in ___ was concerned and notified BU who sent campus
police. He states that he fell asleep and when he woke up by the
police at his door. 

Patient states that at the beginning of the school year he was
doing really well, socializing, performing well in class
exercising, and that his mood was good. He said for "no reason"
that he can identify, he started experiencing poor mood,
insomnia, lack of concentration. Patient reports that his sleep
has been particularly difficult. ___ states he has severe
racing thoughts interfering with ability to fall asleep, 
frequent
awakenings, and occasional "panic" like attacks at night. These
episodes of panic, include sweats and chills, sob and chest
tightness with associated racing thoughts that resolve gradually
after one hour. Patient was attending classes but noticed that 
he
was not been performing well. This week in the setting of
multiple tests in Organic chemistry, cell biology, anatomy
patient reported increasing passive suicidality. 

Patient denies periods of having increased energy goal directed
behavior, hyper sexuality, lack of need for sleep. Endorses 
prior
SA over the summer with a knife. Patient denies intent stating
that action was more "reactive" and that he performed it 
"without
thinking" rather than as a need for escape. He says he
immediately regretted it because it hurt.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY: 
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. He was also placed on q15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. He did not 
require physical or chemical restraints during his 
hospitalization. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:

depressive Sx in the past, no hx of psychiatric 
hospitalizations, s/p one SA by wrist cutting using ___ 
knife, no medication trials, who presented to the ___ ED via 
EMS after texting his
girlfriend about recently worsening depressive and anxiety 
symptoms.

On admission, patient expressed difficulty with concentration 
and sleep, decreased appetite resulting in 15 pound weight loss, 
decreased energy and ability to perform ADLs, hopelessness, 
worthlessness, and passive SI. Examination was notable for 
anxious and dysphoric underlying mood with overly bright/smiling 
affect. He was pleasant, easily engaging, and forthcoming during 
interview and denied any intentions of hurting self in the unit, 
but exhibited poor insight into mental illness and poor 
judgment.  

The patients presentation was concerning for Adjustment 
disorder with mixed emotional features vs MDD. Patient was 
initially started on Sertraline 25 mg daily, LORazepam 1 mg 
PO/NG BID:PRN for insomnia/anxiety, and Ramelteon 8 mg PO/NG 
QHS:PRN for insomnia. During hospitalization, Sertraline was 
increased to 50 mg daily. The patient tolerated the change in 
dose well and found it to be helpful for his mood. 

At time of discharge, patient was able to describe that his mood 
was more "in control" and patient had brighter affect. Able to 
express goal and future oriented mindset with improved insight 
and judgment. Expressed understanding of how to manage stress at 
discharge and provided examples of re-starting his running 
routine or speaking with his therapist. No longer endorsed 
suicidal ideation and sleep, concentration, energy, appetite 
overall improved.

#) GROUPS/MILIEU: 
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. He was often visible in the 
milieu and was appropriate in his interaction with peers and 
staff without ever requiring restraint or seclusion. 

#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
The patients family (mother and father) was involved in the 
patients treatment and discharge planning, and was provided 
with the opportunity to discuss the patients diagnosis and 
treatment with the primary treatment team. The patients family

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team.  

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself and/or others based upon 
expressed suicidal ideation.  His static factors noted at that 
time included increased risk of harm to self include history of 
suicide attempt, history of substance abuse, male gender, 
Caucasian race, age, and family history of suicide attempt. His 
modifiable risk factors included suicidal ideation, limited 
social supports, no established outpatient providers, insomnia, 
feeling trapped, active substance use (cannabis). Some 
modifiable risk factors were addressed during hospitalization 
via medication management, psychotherapeutic intervention, and 
aftercare coordination.  Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective risk factors, including 
help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, no agitation, 
family support, reality testing ability, no history of abuse. 
Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness.
