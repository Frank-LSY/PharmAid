Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a past medical history
of recently diagnosed HFrEF (36%) of uncertain etiology who
presents with weight gain, abdominal distention, shortness of
breath suggestive of an acute heart failure exacerbation.

# CORONARIES: Unknown
# PUMP: EF 36% (___)
# RHYTHM: Sinus

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
============== 
# Acute heart failure with reduce ejection fraction:
Recent diagnosis of heart failure in ___ of uncertain 
etiology with NHBK and afterload up-titration as an outpatient. 
Patient never received proper follow-up. Exam on admission 
notable for volume overload, tachycardia, but warm, well 
perfused. She was referred from clinic for diuresis and 
expedited workup including RHC/LHC for evaluation of cardiac 
output and to rule out coronary artery disease. proBNP only 68, 
however patient with mildly elevated JVP and abdominal 
distention on admission. Given lasix 40mg IV qd with adequate 
response. Abdominal ultrasound was obtained given low BNP and 
was negative for ascites or an acute process. RHC/LHC showed 
normal filling pressures, no obstructive coronary disease. 
Continued home lisinopril 30mg daily for afterload. Continued 
home spironolactone at 25mg qd. Decreased carvedilol to 6.25 BID 
(home 12.5mg bid), as patient was only taking once a day. 
Discharge diuresis with PO lasix 40mg qd

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
===================
# Hypothyroidism: 
Low TSH and T4 on previous admission, indicating secondary
hypothyroidism. TFTs have normalized after stopping biotin in 
the
past few months. Recommend follow-up as outpatient

#Hypercortisolism - cortisol slightly high at 22.8. Likely ___
stress response during admission, can f/u as outpt

TRANSITION ISSUES: 
================
Discharge creatinine 0.6
Discharge weight 145.72 lb

[] Diuresis - monitor weights as outpatient with titration of 
lasix as needed
[] Hypothyroidism - f/u TFTs as patient with low TSH and T4 on 
previous admission, which normalized after stopping biotin 
[] Bloating - consider GI follow up if bloating persistent after 
optimization of HF management
[] Hypercortisolism - slightly high on admission, likely ___ 
stress response. Would repeat as outpatient

MEDICATION CHANGES
[] increased furosemide 30mg daily to 40mg daily
[] Decreased carvedilol from 12.5mg BID to 6.25 BID

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

Why were you admitted to the hospital?
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling 
bloated, which we were concerned was due to your heart failure. 
Please see below for more information on your hospitalization. 
It was a pleasure participating in your care!    

What happened while you were in the hospital?  
- We gave you water pills to remove any extra fluid from your 
heart. 
-You had a procedure called a coronary angiogram to look at the 
arteries in your heart.  This was normal, and did not show any 
narrowing or blockages. You also had a procedure called a right 
heart catheterization to measure the pressures heart.  This was 
also normal, without any elevation in pressure.
-You also received an abdominal ultrasound which did not show 
any abnormalities
-Given these normal tests and blood tests, we felt confident 
your heart was no longer causing your abdominal symptoms.
-Your pain improved with medications and you were ready to leave 
the hospital.

What should you do after leaving the hospital?  
-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary 
and follow up at the listed appointments.
