History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ ___ woman with h/o HTN, HLD, 
TIA
___ years ago) and stroke ___ years ago) who presents to us 
after
an episode of left hand clumsiness and left visual field cut.

She is in her normal state of health until the evening of ___. 
At 7:50pm, she was getting ready for bed.  (She sleeps early
typically.) She noticed that her left hand and arm was clumsy 
and
numb and "wouldn't move" as she was disrobing herself. She also
noted a left visual field cut. She did not try to cover either
eye to check.  She called her husband but her speech was 
slurred.
She had no problem knowing what she wants to say.  

Her husband came and check on her and she was able to understand
him.  She was lucid the whole time.  Her husband asked her to
raise her arm and she had no drift at 5 mins since the onset of
her symptoms. Her speech was still slurred at the time She was
able to stand and walk to the car.  Her husband drove her to the
police station and that was when an ambulance was called. Her
field cute lasted about 10 mins, the slurred speech 20 mins, and
left arm clumsiness 45mins.  Her arm still still a bit off
currently.  She was brought to ___ and referred
here for TIA w/u.

Of note: the TIA ___ years ago presented similarly, affecting her
left arm with visual changes.  The stroke ___ years ago resulted
in left foot drop but she currently has no residual deficit. She
cannot recall what TIA/stroke workup she had in the past.

lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or

or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function (biplane LVEF = 55 %). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left 
ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size

is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad.

origins of the great vessels not well evaluated on this study on 
both the noncontrast and post contrast imaging.

silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia or other 
pathological parenchymal process.  Normal hilar and mediastinal

2.  Multiple sub 4 mm pulmonary nodules for which ___ year 
followup is required if the patient is high risk for pulmonary 
malignancy.  If low risk, no further evaluation is needed per 
___ guidelines. 

CT Abd/pelvis ___. Hypervascular lesion in segment VI, which could represent a 
hemangioma or hepatic varix but MRI is recommended for further 
characterization. 
2. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis 
3. 8.6 x 2.6 cm lipoma along the left flank.

The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or 
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial 
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect 
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the 
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Moderate to severe mitral 
regurgitation. Thoracic aorta atheroma.  

Cardiac Telemetry monitoring: my read showed intermittent 
afib/aflutter only seen on the day of discharge ___ 
intermittently, suggesting pAfib as the cause of her stroke
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ woman w PMH HTN, HLD, h/o TIA ___ y ago, with L 
arm weakness) and stroke ___ y ago, L leg weakness), p/w L hand 
clumsiness, numbness, and weakness, with slurred speech and a L 
visual field cut. These were very similar to her prior TIA sx ___ 
years ago. These symptoms were transient and lasted < 1 hour, 
exam was normal at time of presentation. However, she still 
endorsed subjectively decreased sensation to light touch on the 
L arm x 1 day ___ graphesthesia is preserved. MRI showed a 
small stroke in the R parietal cortex near the hand area. She 
was initially transitioned from ASA to plavix given that she had 
had this event on aspirin. However, on the last day of 
hospitalization she went into afib/aflutter intermittently on 
cardiac telemtry monitoring; this was likely the cause of her 
recurrent strokes and TIAs. Thus she was planned to transition 
from plavix to apixaban. Since it was the weekend when she was 
discharged, she was instructed to see if she could get the 
apixaban covered by her insurance this weekend, and if it was 
not covered, to stay on plavix until ___ when she could call 
our secretary to help with the insurance approval process. Once 
apixaban is started she knows to stop plavix. She was also 
started on atorvastatin for elevated LDL, LDL should be checked 
in 3 months and statin adjusted with goal LDL ___.

Since this stroke appeared to be embolic because of its 
distribution, she underwent an extensive work up for etiology of 
embolism prior to afib/aflutter being observed on tele on the 
last day. This included CT torso to look for malignancy, which 
found some small lung nodules that could be followed in ___ year 
if she his high risk of lung cancer, and vascular liver lesion 
requring follow up MRI. TTE did not show ASD, PFO, or thrombus, 
so ___ was pursued on ___, which was also negative for source 
of thrombus. This did show moderate to severe MR.

___, we were also going to suggest an outpatient Holter 
monitor or other ___ cardiac monitoring (e.g., Reveal 
device) for further capturing and characterization of her 
afib/aflutter events. In light of her transient AFib in the 
hospital, this issue is less relevant now, but could still be 
considered if deemed necessary.

BP was allowed to autoregulate, and BP remained stable.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- ___ with PCP
- ___ with Neurology, both at ___ x 1 visit, and then closer 
to home therafter. PCP to provide referral to closer 
neurologist.
- PCP follow up for moderate to severe MR seen on echo
- assistance with getting apixaban insurance coverage as needed
- outpatient cardiac monitor
- There were some nodules on Ct torso, if she has high risk of 
pulmonary malignancy she could get repeat scan in ___ year, 
otherwise does not need a scan. 
- liver lesion which requires MRI liver as an outpatient
- Atorvastatin was started for elevated LDL, please recheck LDL 
in 3 months, goal < 100
- goal normotension, continue to manage BP

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for L arm weakness, and you 
were found to have a small stroke in her parietal lobe. You were 
initially transitioned from aspirin to plavix, but then your 
telemetry monitoring showed several episodes of afib/aflutter, 
which likely was the cause of your stroke. Thus, we will plan to 
transition you from plavix to apixiban as an outpatient. This 
may require insurance approval, so if you have any issues 
getting approval or it this is very expensive, please continue 
the plavix for now, and call Dr. ___ secretary on ___ at 
___ or call the case manager at ___. Once your 
insurance covers the apixaban, discontinue plavix and start 
apixaban.

You had a CT torso which showed a small lesion in your liver 
that is likely just an abnormal vessel, however, radiology 
recommends an MRI of your liver. We would also like you to get 
an outpatient cardiac monitor to further work you up for atrial 
fibrillation vs a flutter, since we saw several episodes of this 
on telemetry monitoring. Finally, ask your PCP to refer you to a 
neurologist closer to your house, or you are welcome to follow 
up at ___.

It is important that you take all medications as prescribed, and 
keep all follow up appointments.
