"concerned about my history". She reports that  she feels they 
are particularly concerned about her report of her recent
overdose attempt approximately 2 weeks ago. Patient reports that 
she had a addition for dance group, and was the only person who

discouraged, and increasingly angry given that she was the only 
person who did not make it.  She then reports that her thoughts

discussed why she had been guarded and unable to discuss safety 
planning, and how she would remain safe over the weekend, she 
reports that she was "feeling overwhelmed".  She notes that she 
had time to think, and "knows she can remain safe".  She cannot
identify any local supports at this time, and it currently has 
no other outpatient providers.

During our initial the patient reports her mood is "feeling 
quite good".  She states that she feels that everyone is 
"overreacting".  She is denying suicidal ideation, and notes

the above-described attempt.  She denies any difficulty with 
concentration, however does note some stress with classes as she 
feels they are harder than at her prior college.  She notes at

and she was worried today that she has been receiving up bad 
grade in that class, and was considering dropping out by this 
coming ___.  She states that this is "not as distress and" 
is the rejection of the dance crew, however continues to have 
difficulty planning if she should become distressed as she did

she would reach out to the behavioral health services if this
happens, however.  

She denies any changes in her appetite, concentration, 
motivation, or interest.  She states that she "does not feel 
depressed", and notes frustration about being at the hospital at 
this time, as well as concern about the cost of a potential 
hospital stay. We discussed disposition options, patient 
preferred to return to school.  She understands, however 
concerned given her recent suicide attempt, and the need for 
possible continued evaluation.

to her studies, and this is most prominent at night where she 
has racing thoughts and has significant difficulty falling

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY: 
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. She also filed a 3 day notice, which 
expired on ___ (the day of discharge).  She was placed on 
q15 minute checks status on admission and remained on that level 
of observation throughout while being unit restricted. She did 
not require physical or chemical restraints during his 
hospitalization. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:

Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ sophomore at ___, recently 
transferred from ___, with past psychiatric history of 
anxiety and depression, sectioned from ___ Student Health for 
recent suicide attempt by overdose on Belsomra and concern for 
ongoing suicidality in the setting of school-related stress. 

On admission, patient endorsed multiple recent stressors 
including college transfer, difficult organic chemistry course, 
and rejection from dance team. Collateral concerning for limited 
outreach, as patient's primary support, mother in ___, knew 
little of daughter's significant emotional distress and 
suicidality, and patient confirms that she would be unlikely to 
tell mother or friends about her mental health or suicidal 
ideation. Patient did not seek immediate medical or social help 
after her suicide attempt on ___, and did not seem to 
recognize the significance of her very impulsive decision. If 
reported ingestion of 20 tabs of 50mg suvorexant is accurate, 
this would be 50x the maximum recommended daily dose; however, 
patient initially stated confidence in belief that this dose 
would not kill her. Of note, patient endorsed prior history of 
self-injurious behavior (hitting the wall), abuse (father 
physically and emotionally abusice), and violent outbursts 
concerning for poor affect regulation, but denied past manic 
episodes. Denied current suicidal ideation, and psychosis. She 
also stated that she has a period of almost daily suicidal 
ideation ___ years ago in addition to poor concentration, 
insomnia, fatigue, and depressed mood. Additionally, she noted 
that she has always had difficulty with relationship building 
and finds human interactions very tiring. Also endorses 
difficulty with math since high school, hand-eye coordination 
(although this could be due to her vision problems), 
hypersensitivity to female voices, and some obsessive 
tendencies. However, denied early childhood difficulty in school 
and tantrums. 

Psychological testing (___) was significant for several notable 
results. First, in the reliability/validity scale, patient had 
very low score in category of denial of symptoms (i.e. she does 
not deny), and slightly above average in the misinterpretation 
category, which could be due to language barriers. However, her 
results were deemed to be interpretable. Had above average 
scores in the majority of clinical, treatment, and pathology 
scales, consistent with her lack of denial. Specifically, she 
had high anxiety score, high borderline scores (specifically in 
categories of self-harm, emotional lability, and lack of 
identity), and high aggression score (specifically in categories 
of homicidal ideation and physical aggression, but not in verbal 
aggression). In the interpersonal scale, she scored very below 
average in areas of assertiveness and social extroversion (i.e. 
she is very passive, submissive, introverted, and isolative). 
Please see note of Dr. ___ psychologist, for 
further details.

Differential diagnosis includes generalized anxiety 
disorder/unspecified anxiety disorder, borderline personality 
disorder vs. less likely major depressive disorder without 
psychotic features, adjustment disorder with depressed and 
anxious features, bipolar disorder, dysthymia, PTSD. GAD or 
otherwise unspecified anxiety disorder likely given patient's 
report of chronic anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, but does not quite 
meet criteria for GAD. Psychological testing supported 
predominance of anxiety rather than mood symptoms.Has cluster B 
traits, specifically borderline, including fear of rejection, 
impulsivity, dramatic emotional reactions, history of 
self-harm/suicidality. Furthermore, psychological testing was 
very suggestive of borderline personality disorder. Adjustment 
disorder with mixed anxiety and depression possible given recent 
transfer to ___ in ___. Despite recent suicide attempt and 
difficulty with sleep, she does not meet criteria for MDD 
currently; however, patient's reported past depressive episode 
meets criteria for MDD. 

Based on her statements, has not had a manic episode and thus 
does not meet criteria for bipolar I/II, but her previous 
behaviors (self injury, violent outbursts, trauma) as well as hx 
of mood disorder with early onset increase her risk for Bipolar 
diathesis. Dysthymia possible given patient has had "depressed 
feelings" for at least ___ year and has had chronic insomnia, but 
it seems as if patient's suicide attempt was very impulsive and 
patient had not been depressed recently. Less likely PTSD given 
no report of intrusive thoughts, avoidance
behavior, but some sxs present including insomnia, angry 
outbursts, and also history of trauma (father). 

Considering patient's past learning difficulties, dislike of 
people/impaired social interactions, poor visuo-spatial learning 
abilities, below average interpersonal skills on psychological 
testing, and poor hand eye coordination, differential includes 
specific learning disorder (likely non-verbal) vs. previously 
reported diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive 
exam/MOCA revealed difficulties with language, abstraction, and 
delayed recall for total score of ___, consistent with 
slightly abnormal cognition. However, language difficulties may 
be due to fact that ___ is patient's second language. 

These symptoms/signs are somewhat possibly due autism spectrum 
disorder, however patient appears to be sociable on exam and 
able to interpret both verbal and non-verbal information 
appropriately, is flexible regarding routines, and has no 
history of chronic obsessions/repetitive behavior (other than 
teeth-brushing routine) or exaggerated reactions to deviations 
from routines. Additionally, it does not seem that patient's 
impairments developed in early childhood, but rather, in 
teenagehood. However, patient does endorse hypersensitivity to 
pitch of female voices, and ___ was suggestive of ASD. 
Neuropsychological testing as an outpatient will be crucial to 
further diagnostic work-up and consideration of learning 
accommodations at ___.

Lab work was unremarkable, including negative toxicology 
screens. No clinical suspicion for secondary etiology due to 
medical causes or substance use. 

Patient was started on escitalopram 5 mg daily while inpatient 
for mood symptoms and anxiety, which was switched to QHS after 
patient reported insomnia at night and sedation during the day. 
Was offered ramelteon PRN for sleeping with good effect. She 
continued to deny current suicidal ideation and endorsed 
improved mood because she was accepted to another dance team. 
She appeared more help-accepting and stated her intention to 
call behavioral health in the setting of future suicidal 
ideation.  

On discharge, she endorsed "good" mood, appeared stable and was 
denying further suicidal ideation. She noted that in the future, 
she would not be inclined to kill herself because she has 
"things [she] needs to do", including laundry and schoolwork, 
positive goals for the future (continuing her studies, building 
healthy relationships in which she can be assertive and 
independent), family and friends would be concerned, and she 
would not want to be hospitalized again. Patient was able to 
engage in affective safety planning and stated that in the 
setting of future suicidal ideation, she would call her mom, 
talk to a friend, call ___, call ___, or 
go to the emergency department. She also expressed her intension 
to continue to follow up with psychiatric care as outpatient. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
No active concerns during hospitalization

4. MEDICAL
No active concerns during hospitalization

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL

#) GROUPS/MILIEU: 
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. Though patient often spent time 
by herself, she was often visible in the milieu and was 
appropriate in her interaction with peers and staff without ever 
requiring restraint or seclusion. 

#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
The patients family was not significantly involved in the 
patients treatment and discharge planning because family lives 
in ___. However, patient was in contact with her mother 
throughout treatment and was provided with the opportunity to 
discuss the patients diagnosis and treatment with the primary 
treatment team. The patients family was supportive of the 
patients treatment and aftercare plan.  

#) INTERVENTIONS

- Medications: 
  -- Escitalopram 5 mg QHS
  -- Hydroxyzine 25 mg BID PRN for anxiety
  -- Ramelteon 8 mg QHS PRN for insomnia
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Behavioral Interventions: encouraged outpatient therapy and 
psychiatry f/u, encouraged use of coping mechanism

- Aftercare/transitional issue:
[ ] Recommend patient pursues neuropsychological testing as 
outpatient to provide diagnostic clarify regarding possible 
learning disorder and inform patient's eligibility for learning 
accommodations at ___ 
[ ] Recommend individual DBT given patient's likely diagnosis of 
borderline personality disorder
[ ] Please continue to assess patient's response to escitalopram 
and monitor for symptoms of mania/suicidality considering her 
recent suicide attempt and past history of poor affect 
regulation

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team.  

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
recent suicide attempt. Her static factors noted at that time 
include history of abuse, chronic mental illness, younger age, 
single relationship status. Her modifiable risk factors included 
lack of outpatient providers, no psychotropic medication 
regimen, acute academic stressors,
impulsivity, limited insight, and poor distress tolerance. The 
modifiable risk factors were addressed during hospitalization 
via medication management, psychotherapeutic intervention, and 
aftercare coordination.  Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective risk factors, including intact 
reality testing,
lack of substance use, and lack of access to lethal weapons. 
Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness.
