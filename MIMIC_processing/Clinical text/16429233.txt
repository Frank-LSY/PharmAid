Pertinent Results:
___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
1. Unchanged hyperdense extra-axial fluid layering primarily 
along the left temporoparietal convexity without evidence of 
significant mass effect. 
2. Mild paranasal sinus disease. 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
1. Unchanged left subdural hematoma.

___ CHEST XRAY 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Large mediastinal mass extending from the level of the 
clavicle to just above the hemidiaphragm with mass effect:  The 
upper trachea just above the carina is shifted to the right, 
left mainstem bronchus is narrowed. 

___ CT CHEST W/CONTRAST 
Findings suggestive of a right pericardial cyst. 
Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 7 mm and right 
middle lobe nodule measuring 6 mm. 
Follow-up of the pulmonary nodules should be determined in the 
clinical 
context. 

___ ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular regional/global systolic
function. Mild left atrial dilatation. Elevated PCWP.

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 
Compared to ___, no significant change in left 
convexity subdural 
hematoma, measuring 6 mm in greatest dimension with minimal 2 mm 
shift of the midline structures to the right. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female who is s/p 3 witnessed 
falls who presented to ___ and imaging was consistent with a 
left subdural hematoma. She was admitted to the ___ with Q2 
hour neurological checks. 

#Subdural Hematoma- A repeat ___ was performed on ___ 
which demonstrated stable left SDH. The patient remained in the 
SDU with Q2H neurological checks. She remained on Keppra 500 mg 
BID. On ___, she had an episode of increased confusion and 
slurred speech - however a NCHCT was performed and stable. 

#Mediastinal Mass: The patient was noted to have a large 
mediastinal mass on CXR while being worked up for question of 
new onset AFIB. A CT chest with contrast was ordered to further 
assess the mass which revealed a pericardial cyst, which does 
not require immediate action and follow-up imaging should be 
arranged in 3 months with the patient's primary care provider. 

#?New AFIB: A medicine consult was placed for concern of new 
onset AFIB versus NSR with PACS. Medicine recommendations were 
appreciated and were implemented for further workup. Per 
Medicine recommendations, there is no need for nodal blocking 
agent at this time given bradycardia, no need for 
anticoagulation at this time given acute on chronic subdural 
hematomas, high fall risk, and low CHADs-vasc score of 1
Will need to consider initiation of ASA 81mg as an out-patient 
for primary prevention of stroke in setting of new diagnosis of 
Afib. This should be discussed in follow-up with the patient's 
PCP and ___.
