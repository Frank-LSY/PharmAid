History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male without significant PMHx referred
from urgent care with new atrial fibrillation.

He states that he was in his USOH until 3 weeks ago when he
started to notice new onset tremors in his extremities. Then,
about 2 weeks ago, he noted intermittent symmetric bilateral leg
swelling, which seemed to come and go. About 1 week ago, he
notices dyspnea on exertion, only able to walk 2 miles instead 
of
his usual 4 miles. Over this 3 week time frame, he has also
experienced unintentional weight loss of ___ lbs, heart 
racing,
generalized weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, voice
hoarseness, diarrhea and heat intolerance. He has also noticed
pain in the back of his R lung, which he believes is a pulled
muscle from playing golf. He has not taken any long trips, aside
from a 3 hour car ride to ___. He further denies chest 
pain,
fevers, chills, dysuria.

These symptoms prompted him to present to ___ urgent care where
he was noted to be in Afib with HR 100s, concern for s/sx CHF 
and
referred to the ED for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY STATEMENT 

Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ PMHx of HTN and a FH of Grave's disease
who is presenting with new atrial fibrillation weight loss,
tremor, heat intolerance and dyspnea on exertion, low TSH, high 
T3/T4 consistent with hyperthryoidism causing Atrial 
Fibrillation and high output HF. 

=============
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Hyperthyroidism
Patient presented with 2 week history of weight loss, tremor, 
heat intolerance was found to have low TSH, high T3/T4 on 
admission and a FH of Grave's Disease. Workup included 
TSH,T3,T4, TPO (+) TSI antibody is pending. Thyroid ultrasound 
was performed did not reveal any nodules. Thyroid technitium 
scan showed increased uptake diffusely in thyroid consistent 
with Graves' disease. Endocrine was consulted and the Patient 
was started on propanolol 20 mg 3 times a day (switched to ER 
60mg daily) and methimazole 10 mg twice daily. Patient is to 
follow-up with endocrinology in 2 weeks and have lab work drawn 
before

#New onset Atrial fibrillation ___ hyperthyroidism
New diagnosis of A-fib. CHADS-Vasc score is 2 (HTN and CHF). 
Etiology likely due to hyperthyroidism, however, also checked 
V/Q scan which was negative for PE. Patient was rate controlled 
with propranolol 20 mg 3 times a day. Anticoagulation was 
started with apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Once hyperthyroidism 
resolved, should have repeat EKG to evaluate for persistence of 
atrial fibrillation.

#c/f High Output Heart Failure
Presented with 1 week history of dyspnea on exertion and 
decreased exercise tolerance with elevated BNP in setting of new 
onset Afib. Lower on DDx was physical pulmonary embolism as 
wells Score 1.5 (tachycardia), and d-dimer was elevated a PE was 
ruled out with a VQ scan. Echocardiogram showed severely dilated 
left atrium increased pulmonary artery pressures, dilated 
SVC/right atrium. Ejection fraction was 70%. Should have repeat 
TTE once acute hyperthyroidism is resolved. 

#Normocytic Anemia: likely anemia of chronic disease with high
ferritin, low transferin and low TIBC.
-Hgb 11.2 from baseline ___. Last colonoscopy ___ with 2
polyps identified, recommended ___ year follow up.

===============
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============

#Hypertension
- Not on home meds patient remained normotensive throughout 
admission

#Other home meds
- Continue ASA 81 mg

==================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[]F/u with PCP ___ ___ for further management of new onset 
atrial fibrillation. Patient on propranolol for rate control 
instead of conventional metoprolol because of concurrent 
hyperthyroidism. Once thyroid hormones normalize consider 
switching to metoprolol. 
[]Please repeat TTE in 1 month or hyperthyroidism normalized to 
follow-up once high output state has resolved.
[] Started on apixaban for atrial fibrillation. Please continue 
to assess the need for anticoagulation as atrial fibrillation 
may resolve with normalization of thyroid hormones.
[] Patient's aspirin for primary prophylaxis was discontinued as 
started on apixaban and not felt to be worth increase risk in 
bleeding. 
[]F/u with endocrinology for further management of new Dx 
Grave's Disease. 
[]Discharged on methimazole 10mg BID. Will need CBC and LFTs 
monitored while on this medication given risk of agranulocytosis 
and transaminitis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you are at ___ 
___,

Why was admitted to the hospital?
Your heart had an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation 
you are also having symptoms of shortness of breath this was 
concerning that there was an abnormality was your thyroid.

What happened while I was in the hospital?
-We diagnosed you with hyperthyroidism through blood test and 
scans.
-We started you on medications to lower your thyroid hormones.
-We started you on a medication to control the rate of your 
hear.
-We started you on an anticoagulant or to prevent your "blood 
thinner" blood from clotting. 

What should I do when only the hospital?
- Please be aware that this puts you at higher risk for 
bleeding.  If you fall and hit her head please seek emergent 
medical care as you are at increased risk of bleeding in his 
brain.
-Stop taking aspirin for now and discuss with PCP if needed to 
be restarted. This can also increase your risk of bleeding.
Take all your medications as prescribed
See your primary care provider ___ 1 week.
Follow-up with endocrinology in 2 weeks
-___ days prior to seeing the endocrinologist have lab work 
performed.  Your endocrinologist will want to see the results of 
that lab work at the appointment.
