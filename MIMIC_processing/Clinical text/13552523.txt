Chief Complaint:
Symptomatic fibroid uterus
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Abdominal multiple myomectomies 

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ gravida 0 with
a fibroid uterus, who has been experiencing increasing pain with
intercourse, increased difficulty with emptying her bladder and
the symptoms are thought to be due to her increasing fibroid
uterus.  On ___, she had an ultrasound, which showed 
a
uterus that was enlarged and measured 18.7 x 7.0 x 12.5 cm. 
There were multiple masses consistent with fibroids.  The 
largest
fibroid was exophytic, located in the fundus and measured
8.4 x 5.8 x 6.6 cm.  A posterior fibroid demonstrated near the
lower uterine segment measured 7.3 x 5.2 x 5.0 cm.  The
endometrium was distorted due to fibroids and could not be
adequately assessed.  The ovaries were normal and there was a
trace amount of free fluid.  Because of the inability to assess
the lining on ultrasound, the patient presents today for
anendometrial biopsy and the signing of a consent for multiple
myomectomy.
