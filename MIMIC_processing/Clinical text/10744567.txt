Brief Hospital Course:
___ yr male with hx of afib on Coumaidn (INR 1.9) HTN who was 
transferred from an OSH after he presented with AMS change, 
aphasia and right facial droop concerning for acute stroke. He 
had a non con CT head and CTA head at the OSH which were 
negative for vessel cut off and hemorrhage but there was a 
concern for questionable L. frontal hypodensity on CT head. His 
symptom slowly improved. At ___ he underwent a repeat CT head 
which showed subacute infarction with surrounding edema in the 
left frontal and temporal lobes. CTA neck showed calcified and 
noncalcified plaque at the origins of bilateral internal carotid 
artery stenosis, with ___ right internal carotid artery 
stenosis.
Etiology of his stroke is likely due to embolism secondary to 
afib in setting of ___ INR.  His pravastatin 40mg 
daily was switched to atorvastatin 80 mg daily. His aspirin was 
being held in setting of acute stroke and warfarin. This was 
discussed with his PCP who will restart aspirin if needed once 
patient follows up with him in clinic. 

Transitional issues:
- follow INR to ensure it remains therapeutic goal ___
- restart ASA 81 mg as needed when he follows up with PCP
- CTA neck also showed a nonspecific right lower paratracheal 
lymphadenopathy 
  measuring 1.3 cm. A dedicated CT chest could be obtained to 
further evaluate.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of confusion, difficulty 
with language and right sided facial droop resulting from a 
stroke, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
Hyperlipidemia 
Hypertension
Atrial fibrillation

Your medications were changed as follows:
-STOP pravastatin
-START Atorvastatin
-HOLD Aspirin until you see your PCP

___ take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
