Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Vertigo, nausea, right sided weakness 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal Echocardiogram

 
History of Present Illness:
___ with PMH of HTN who presented to the ED as a code stroke due
to vertigo, nausea, and subjective R sided weakness. 

He was having sexual intercourse with his partner when he
suddenly began to feel like the room was spinning. This was
associated with nausea but no vomiting and no headache 
initially.
He felt like he couldn't get up because everything was spinning
around him. This sensation lasted for about 15 minutes.

He later began to feel flushed and sweaty. He also began to have
a R frontal headache, about ___ in severity. He denied visual
changes, fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting.
Denies history of stroke. Upon interview with the examiner, the
only symptom he endorsed was a mild subjective feeling of
weakness on the R side and the ___ R frontal headache. Upon
arrival to the ED, one of the RNs noted that he was veering off
to the R when walking. 

His FSBG was noted to be in the 150s and his measured BP was
173/86.

IMAGING:
========
CTA HEAD/NECK ___:
1. No evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage or intracranial 
mass. 
2. Patent intracranial and cervical vasculature without evidence 
of high-grade stenosis, dissection, occlusion or aneurysm 
formation greater than 3 mm. 

MRI/MRA BRAIN ___:
1. Small acute/early subacute infarcts in the right cerebellum. 
2. No sinus venous thrombosis, normal MRV brain. 
3. Patent major neck veins. 
4. 3.7 cm left thyroid mass, ultrasound recommended. 
  
BILATERAL ___ ULTRASOUND ___:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

THYROID ULTRASOUND ___:
There is a 3.7 x 2.6 x 3.8 cm heterogeneous, predominantly 
isoechoic nodule in the lower pole of the left lobe of the 
thyroid, for which FNA is recommended for tissue sampling on a 
non-urgent basis. 
  
TTE ___:
The left atrial volume index is normal. No thrombus/mass is seen 
in the body of the left atrium (best excluded by TEE). The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence of an atrial 
septal defect or patent foramen ovale by 2D/color Doppler or 
agitated saline at rest and with maneuvers. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. The left ventricle has a normal 
cavity size. There is mild (nonobstructive) focal basal septal 
hypertrophy. There is normal regional and global left 
ventricular systolic function. No thrombus or mass is seen in 
the left ventricle. The visually estimated left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 55-60%. There is no resting left 
ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect 
is seen. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free 
wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch is 
mildly dilated. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations 
are seen on the mitral valve. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. No mass/vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. 
There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. However, the 
absence of right ventricular hypertrophy, right heart chamber 
dilation, and depressed right ventricular systolic function 
makes moderate or severe pulmonary artery hypertension unlikely. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild upper septal left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic 
function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. 
No definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified. 

TEE ___:
There is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is normal. No spontaneous echo contrast or 
thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. There is no evidence of an atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale by 2D/color Doppler or agitated saline at 
rest and with maneuvers. There are simple atheroma in the aortic 
arch with no atheroma in the descending aorta to from the 
incisors. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. No masses 
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. No abscess 
is seen. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/vegetation 
are seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is seen. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation.

IMPRESSION: No PFO seen.

were negative for DVTs in both lower extremities. 
- Transesophageal echocardiogram was done but negative for any 
cause of cardioembolism. 
- ___ was ordered to be scheduled after-discharge. 
- Hypercoagulability labs sent

#Thyroid mass - 3.7 cm left thyroid mass found incidentally
- TSH 1.7
- Thyroid ultrasound shows 3.7 x 2.6 x 3.8 cm heterogeneous, 
predominantly isoechoic nodule in the lower pole of the left 
lobe of the thyroid, for which FNA is recommended for tissue 
sampling on a non-urgent basis. 

___ - Cr initially elevated to 1.44 but later improved to 1.1

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of vertigo, nausea, and 
weakness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE in your 
cerebellum, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is 
the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  
 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 High blood pressure
 High cholesterol - LDL 130
 
 We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Starting aspirin 81 mg daily
- Starting Plavix 75 mg daily
- Starting Atorvastatin 40 mg daily
- Changing omeprazole to pantoprazole

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

You were also found to have a 3.7 cm left thyroid mass on CT 
scan. This was further evaluated with an ultrasound. 

You must ___ with your PCP for ___ referral to an ENT 
specialist to evaluate the thyroid mass. Your thyroid function 
was normal - TSH 1.7. 

 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
(PCP) as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  

 Your ___ Neurology Team
