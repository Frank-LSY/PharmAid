#RISK ASSESSMENT  
At the time of discharge Ms ___ was at her baseline moderately 
elevated risk of harm to self and others.

CHRONIC/STATIC RISK FACTORS 
Hx trauma (severe bullying)
Hx 2 prior high lethality suicide attempts
Hx longstanding affective disorder
Hx of impulsivity (ADHD)

MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
Lack of connection with outpatient providers 

___ with treatment 
Future Orientation 
No history of violence 
Rapid resolution of mood decompensation 
Denial of suicidal ideation 
Social supports  mother, boyfriend, boyfriends family

#PROGNOSIS Guarded
On presentation, Ms ___ was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based on her 
recent high lethality suicide attempt.  Her static factors noted 
at that time include history of lonstanding affective disorder, 
history of trauma (severe bullying), history of 2 prior 
high-lethality suicide attempts and longstanding impulsivity.  
At the time of admission, Ms ___ denied ongoing mood 
decompensation or suicidal ideation, but demonstrated poor 
insight into her longstanding mood disorder and recent high 
lethality suicide attempt.   Additional modifiable risk factors 
of  lack of connection with outpatient treaters and poor insight 
into her illness were addressed through psychoeducation and 
robust aftercare planning..  Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective risk factors, lack of suicidal 
ideation, improvement in mood as well as extensive 
psychoeducation around importance of aftercare planning and 
psychopharmacologic interventions (zoloft).  Overall, based on 
the totality of our assessment at this time, the patient is 
thought to be at his baseline chronically elevated moderate risk 
of self-harm/suicide and is not thought to be at an acutely 
elevated risk. Our Prognosis of this patient is guarded given 
her history of multiple prior impulsive high lethality suicide 
attempts.
