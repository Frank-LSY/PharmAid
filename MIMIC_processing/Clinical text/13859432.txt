Brief Hospital Course:
___ w chronic low back pain, new diagnosis of PE/DVT, chronic
methadone use for past substance abuse trx from OSH for sedation
and hypercarbia that has since resolved.  

#Hypercarbic resp failure: resolved.  initially on bipap at ___ and now weaned to RA.  No signs of acute parenchymal
lung disease.  Suspect this event occurred because of numerous
sedating meds that include gabapentin, alprazolam, methadone
(took home bottle per the ___ clinic)
--monitor resp status

#DVT/PE: I agree with admitting MD, Dr. ___ that
rather than treatment failure he may have had co-existing PE at
time DVT were found but since chest was imaged later it was 
found
at a later time.
--continue rivaroxaban 15mg PO BID for first 21d followed by 
20mg
daily
--I confirmed that the patient filled the Rx and picked up 
rivaroxaban 15mg PO BID 42 tab Rx last week.  HE does not have 
Rx yet for maintenance dose of 20mg tab
--next dose rivaroxaban tonight 

#Chronic low back pain: acutely worse.  Lumbar XRay did not
demonstrate compression fracture.  no clinical evidence of quada
equina syndrome and deferred on MRI spine
--continue methadone for substance use
--hold off on restarting gabapentin given clinical presentation 
w
lethargy

He worked with ___ and ambulated.  He should get ___ and OT 
referral for management of low back pain through PCPs office.   

___ shows: Rx for gabapentin 400mg, alprazolam 1mg tabs on 
___

Med management: unclear indication of clonidine and Lasix.
Meds that could have contributed to sedation and need caution to
restart include cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, oxazepam (not on ___ though) and methadone.

#Substance use: since I confirmed dose and he is in pain will
continue home dose of methadone
--methadone 97mg daily

I spoke w PCP's coverage and it would be helpful to speak with
PCP about management of low back pain tomorrow if possible given
numerous sedating meds and hospitalization for sedation.

I met with family at bedside.

Counselled patient on warning signs of worsened DVT/PE, new 
neurological problems related to back pain and risk of combining 
multiple sedating meds.
