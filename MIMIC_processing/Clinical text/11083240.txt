She underwent colonoscopy ___ with 7 mm submucosal lesion at 
the hepatic flexure (path: granular cell tumor extending to 
tissue edges S100 stain +). On ___ the GI team did an 
endoscopic mucosal resection of the granular cell tumor.

At 2am this morning, she developed BRBPR x 4 episodes and she 
presented to the ___ ED. Her hematocrit fell from 36 to 30;

suggested extravastion from the prior procedural site. She went

CT abd/pelvis:
1. Active extravasation of contrast from the posterior wall of 
the ascending 
colon and hepatic flexure of the colon likely corresponds to the 
site of 
recent colonic polyp resection during colonoscopy.  There are 
tiny locules of 
air outside the lumen of the colon as seen on series 2, image 
49, 48 and 52 
concerning for microperforation.  No large pericolonic fluid 
collection or 
hematoma. 
2. Colon is distended with mildly fluid, likely hemorrhagic 
fluid. 
3. Diffuse hepatic steatosis. 
  

___ colonoscopy
Old blood was noted in the distal colon. At the hepatic flexure, 
adherent clot was noted over the previous EMR site. The area was 
thoroughly irrigated and a small actively bleeding vessel was 
underneat the polyp. 2cc epi were initially injected around the 
bleeding area. 3 hemoclips were then successfully deployed over 
the bleeding vessel; complete cessation of bleeding was noted. 
10cc epi was then additional injected at the bleeding site.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a lovely ___ with h/o granular cell tumor 
of the colon, tobacco abuse, HTN, depression, who recently had a 
colonoscopic procedure to remove a sub-mucosal lesion, who now 
p/w lower GI bleed. 

#) GI bleed: related to procedure to removal colonic polyp on 
___, now w/ bleeding from operative site, now s/p clips x4 and 
epinephrine injection on ___. Colonoscopy showed significant 
amount of old blood in colon, given that H/H now stabilizing the 
blood that she is now passing is likely old blood. Her 
hemoglobin stabilized and she had no BM for nearly 24 hours 
prior to discharge. She wished to avoid transfusion and was 
given IV iron for 2 doses.
- F/u with PCP, recommend repeat CBC check
- Started ferrous sulfate BID and bowel regimen
- Counselled to return to ED if she rebleeds, would need repeat 
colonoscopy.

#) Transaminitis: may be related to ~3 drinks/night. CT showed 
diffuse hepatic steatosis. Thus likely has NASH vs alcoholic 
inflammation. Ongoing discussion RE cutting EtOH back as 
probably not a healthy level.  Slight improvement prior to 
discharge. 
-Repeat LFTs with PCP

#) HTN: held lisinopril initially, restarted on discharge.

#) Depression: continue bupropion 

FEN: clears, IVF, replete electrolytes

placing clips.  Your blood counts fell but are stable and you 
had no further bleeding.  You were given IV iron and are being
