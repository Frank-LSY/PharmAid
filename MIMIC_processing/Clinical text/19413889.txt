Imaging: 
RUQ U/S: 
1.  Cholelithiasis,  not  seen  on  the  ___ 
ultrasound.  The gallbladder  wall  is  diffusely  thickened 
with  questionable  trace edema,  which  may  be  secondary  to 
either  chronic  cholecystitis  or chronic  liver disease.  In 
the  absence  of  a  positive  sonographic ___  sign,  and 
given  the  spontaneous  resolution  of  the  patient's   pain, 
acute  cholecystitis  is  unlikely,  but  please  correlate
clinically.
2.  Persistent  abnormal  liver  echotexture,  compatible  with 
fatty infiltration,  particularly  given  evidence  of  mild 
fatty  sparing  near the  gallbladder.  However, superimposed 
other  types  of  liver  disease, as  well  as  more  advanced 
liver  disease  such  is  steatohepatitis  or  cirrhosis,  
cannot
be  excluded  with  this  sonographic  appearance.
3.  Persistent  splenomegaly  dating  back  to  at  least  ___. 

Please correlate  clinically  whether  this  may  be  related  
to
portal hypertension  or  other  causes.

MRCP ___

1. Nondilated biliary tree, without choledocholithiasis.
2. Cholelithiasis is not well demonstrated the nondistended 
gallbladder.
3. Possible adenomyomatosis of gallbladder.
4. Enlarged spleen, unchanged since ___.
5. No evidence of hepatic steatosis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  
Admission abdominal ultra-sound revealed cholelithiasis which 
was not  seen  on  the  ___ ultrasound.  The 
gallbladder  wall  was diffusely  thickened with  questionable  
trace edema,  which  may  be  secondary  to either  chronic  
cholecystitis  or chronic  liver disease (of which the patient 
has a history). Furthermore,  persistent  abnormal  liver  
echotexture,  compatible  with fatty infiltration,  particularly 
 given  evidence  of  mild  fatty  sparing  near the  
gallbladder and  persistent  splenomegaly  dating  back  to  at  
least  ___ was seen. Additionally, the patient was found to 
have elevated LFTs on admission, ALT: 980 AP: 107 Tbili: 2.5 
AST: 781 Lip: 63. A hepatitis panel was ordered and LFTs were 
downtrending. An MRCP was preformed that showed no additional 
gallstones. The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
and liver biopsy on ___, which went well without complication 
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor. 

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay. At discharge his LFTs 
and bilirubin elevations were resolving. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
