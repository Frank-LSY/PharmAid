History of Present Illness:
___ year old left handed male with history of hyperlipidemia, CAD
s/p 3 stents, HTN, TGA, complex migraines and left thalamic
infarct in ___ with no residual deficits who presents with
amnesia. 

History obtained with help of daughters, patient and patient's
wife. Patient has history of complex migraines since ___
diagnosed with ___ syndrome by Dr. ___. These 
episodes
were stereotyped neuro symptoms with migraine and eventually
resolved with verapamil. The wife described these as sudden
headaches with left sided visual symptoms and visual loss. He 
has
not had these recently. Of note, at some point he had a 24 hour
EEG (in ?___ given concern that these episodes may have 
been
seizure and the EEG was normal. Then in the past few years,
patient has had some odd episodes. In ___ he had an
episode of slurred speech as well as garbled speech and some
possible short term memory loss. He was seen in ___ and
reported was told he had a thalamic stroke. He was on a heart
monitor for about a month after this without atrial 
fibrillation.
He has continued on aspirin. 

Then in ___ he had an episode of repeating questions for
<24 hour period at which time he was diagnosed with TGA. This
occurred in the setting of doing a lot of yard work and drinking
2 glasses of wine so there was thought to be a dehydration
component. 

He saw Dr. ___ this year who felt that the one 
episode
did sound like TGA and the other episode was perhaps a migraine
process but not particularly stroke. 

Since this time he has been doing well. He continues to exercise
frequently and works doing ___. He is quite sharp
according to his daughters. He has had 2 episodes over the past
several months lasting seconds in which he seems confused but
then completely goes back to normal. Otherwise there have been 
no
changes.

Then on ___ he came to visit his daughters in ___. He
reports he was feeling well without illness. The patient tells 
me
he remembers his trip down to ___ very well. He is able to
describe the events of the day on ___. He remembers going 
to
his granddaughters gymnastic competition and remembers all but
one of the events she competed in. He knows she received awards
but cannot say how many. He then remembered coming home to watch
the ___ vs. ___ game and remembers the ___ won the game.
He did not remember going to lunch prior to this but later
remembers when reminded by his daughter and is able to say what
he had to eat. He does not remember what he ate for dinner. He
remembers going to bed but then upon awakening the events become
"fuzzy".  

His daughters are able to provide the rest of the history as the
patient cannot. His daughter reports he seemed normal last night
prior to going to bed. He discussed that he would be his 
daughter
for breakfast at 0830 AM the next morning. Then the next morning
he was seen in the kitchen by his son-in-law at 0830. Upon
inquiring while he was still at home and not meeting his 
daughter
for breakfast he had no recollection of the plans. He then 
called
his daughter and asked if they had plans (he has no recollection
of this phone call currently). He was able to drive himself to
the restaurant. At breakfast he was more quite and not talking
much. He was able to eat and move around without issue. There 
was
no changes in his speech. When they left the restaurant they 
went
to a museum. On the way to the museum he kept saying "where are
we again?". At the museum he kept asking the same questions over
and over again like "what temperature is it?", "what town are we
in". He didn't seem to have any weakness, slurred speech. When
asked if he was ok he said "I feel fine". Of note, at one point
in the museum she felt like her father was walking more hunched
over and shuffling "like an old man" but this resolved within a
short period of time. Given this odd behavior the daughter
decided to bring him to the ED. On the way to the ED he kept
saying, "which hospital are we going to", "what are the symptoms
you're concerned about". 

Since arriving at ___, he has been much improved. He has only
repeated himself two times and overall his symptoms are
improving. 

At time of my evaluation he was able to remember he went to a
museum today but not which one. He reports that things are
feeling fuzzy but does know he is at ___. He denies
headache or other symptoms. He has no history of seizures,
olfactory hallucinations, tongue biting or incontinence.

ROS: Positive as above, otherwise notable for perhaps slight
decreased exercise tolerance with running. No overt CP, sob or
dizziness. He has not had headaches in quite some time.

- ___ MRI Brain
1. Probable acute/subacute infarct in the left precentral gyrus. 
 No 
hemorrhage. 
2. Chronic microvascular angiopathy changes. 

- ___ CTA Head & Neck
CT head: Gray-white matter differentiation is maintained. 
Diffuse 
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are 
nonspecific, however are most related to ___ crew angiopathy. A 
6 mm hypodensity is seen in the left thalami (03:24). There is 
no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or mass. The ventricles and 
sulci are mildly prominent, particularly in the temporal horns. 
No osseous abnormalities. Paranasal sinus, mastoid air cells and 
years are clear. Very mild paraseptal emphysema is seen in the 
apices of the lung. Only the right thyroid lobe is seen. No 
supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is noted. 
  
CTA head and neck: Normal 3 vessel takeoff. 
Patent common carotid arteries with calcified plaques are noted 
in both 
carotid siphons with bilateral soft plaque, and ulceration, 
worse on the 
right. Subclavian, and internal carotid and vertebral arteries 
are patent 
without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm or dissection. 


The vessels of the circle of ___ and their principal 
intracranial branches appear patent. Mild calcifications are 
noted in bilateral dental carotid arteries in the cavernous 
segments. No stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation. The 
dural venous sinuses are patent. 

- ___ EEG
Normal. Final read pending.
