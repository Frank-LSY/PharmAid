Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F 6 weeks pregnant with history of prior 
ventral hernia
that was primarily repaired, who presented to ___ on ___ 
with abdominal pain and an incarcerated ventral hernia. In the 
ED, the Acute Care Surgery (___) service attempted reduction of 
the the incarcerated hernia at the bedside, and she was admitted 
to ___ for further surgical management. Obstetrics and 
Gynecology were consulted to discuss with the patient the risks 
of anesthesia/surgery in the first trimester.

The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent 
ventral hernia repair without mesh placement.  The patient 
tolerated this procedure well (reader, please refer to operative 
note for further details). After remaining hemodynamically 
stable in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the surgical 
floor for pain control and to await return of bowel function.  

On POD #0, the patient was written for a regular diet which was 
well-tolerated.  Pain was managed with oral acetaminophen and 
oxycodone. She remained alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization. She remained stable from a cardiovascular and 
pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good 
pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. Intake and output were 
closely monitored. The patient's fever curves were closely 
watched for signs of infection, of which there were none.
The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs of 
bleeding, of which there were none. The patient was encouraged 
to get up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
