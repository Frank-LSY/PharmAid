1. No acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal intracranial

EEG:
-No epileptiform discharges
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with past medical history of A. fib (on 
Xarelto, Metoprolol), Aortic stenosis S/p AVR, Bilateral carotid 
artery stenosis, chronic coronary artery
disease, hyperlipidemia, h/o prostate adenocarcinoma presenting 
with possible first-time seizure, which was reportedly resolved 
s/p Ativan in the ambulance.

#POSSIBLE SEIZURE: EEG showed no seizure-like activity or other 
abnormalities. Given history of prostate cancer, MRI head was 
obtained to assess for potential metastasis that could be 
serving as a seizure focus. However, it returned WNL. Toxic, 
metabolic, infectious work-up also returned WNL. Per wife at 
bedside, the mental status has remained at baseline since 
admission. It is possible that the patient had a first-time 
seizure, though it is unclear what the precipitant was. As the 
episode initially occurred as the patient was sleeping, 
parasomnia or REM-sleep behavior disorder. Per discussion, the 
patient and wife deferred starting on an AED.

#COMORBIDITIES: the patient was continued on his home 
medications.
