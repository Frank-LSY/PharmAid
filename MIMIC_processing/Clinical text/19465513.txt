Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to ___. Review of imaging was 
notable for right ___ rib fractures, consistent with chest 
wall tenderness. Otherwise, no other evidence of acute trauma. 
Given
his age, and his multiple levels of rib fractures, he is at 
significant risk for pneumonia or other complications from his 
fall. He was admitted for adequate pain control, incentive 
spirometry use, and physical therapy evaluation.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization. CT Head showed no acute traumatic injury. On 
___ he was noted to be light-headed and nauseous, with an 
equivocal pupillary exam in the setting of previous cataract 
surgery, the decision was made to repeat head imaging; no acute 
intracranial processes were identified. The patient was noted to 
have middle ear opacification, consistent with his hearing loss 
and need for hearing aids. The patients symptoms resolved 
without intervention. 

His pain was managed with oral agents and well controlled at 
time of discharge. 

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. The importance of 
incentive spirometry and breathing exercises were emphasized to 
the patient to prevent respiratory distress after rib fracture; 
the patient was compliant with recommendations. 

On initial imaging, the patient was noted to have a 2.2cm RUL 
spiculated mass. He was evaluated by thoracic surgery and 
interventional pulmonology, who offered recommendations for 
work-up. The patient declined inpatient work-up. He was given 
contact information for follow-up with multi-disciplinary lung 
cancer clinic should he choose to pursue work-up. 

GI/GU/FEN: The patient tolerated a regular diet and was voiding 
without difficulty. Electrolytes were routinely monitored and 
repleted as necessary. 

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible. He was evaluated by 
physical therapy who recommended home ___. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  He was restarted on all home medications.
