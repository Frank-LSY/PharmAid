History of Present Illness:
___ with a history of a knee replacement 9 weeks ago, atrial 
fibrillation on Coumadin, diabetes  presents with 2 days of 
right leg swelling. States his leg is been getting progressively 
more swollen over the course of a few days. Presented to ___ 
___ today with lactate of 7, found to have 
hypotension. Got vancomycin and Unasyn. Got CT scan of the leg, 
concern for ___ transferred to ___.  report 
from transfer from ___, hypoglycemic on arrival to 40, 
D50 given, levophed started, evaluation for DVT negative. 

In ED initial VS: 97.0 129 100/58 16 95% RA 
  
Labs significant for: WBC 3/Hgb 13.6/Lactate 6.8-> Lactate 4.7
7.___
 
Patient was given: IV Zosyn, IV Clindamycin, IV norepinephrine,  
IV Vasopressin, IV Vitamin K 10, IVF as below,

Imaging notable for: CT per report negative for SUBQ gas
 
Consults: Orthopedics, Surgery 

Right knee arthrocentesis done

Concern for necrotizing fasciitis. Central line was placed for 
levophed. Given a fourth and fifth liter here. Given clindamycin 
and Zosyn. Will discuss with surgery and orthopedic.

At 7 ___ ___, he was status post 5 L, now on 2 pressors. His 
mental status remained stable. After in-depth discussion of 
surgery attending with family, they do not want surgery. There 
is no gas in the CT and it is very unclear that this represents 
necrotizing fasciitis. Rather this seems to represent cellulitis 
with an infected fluid collection. No operative intervention 
planned at this time.

His lactate was clearing, but he remained hypotensive and 
tachycardic. 

We have had difficulty obtaining an oxygen saturation, however 
his mental status has remained quite stable over this time, and 
he is conversant. He has no acute cardio pulmonary issues. 
Reassessment of lung status at 7:30 ___ did not note any 
significant crackles.
 
VS prior to transfer:  98.4 129 107/52 26  92% Non-Rebreather 
 
On arrival to the MICU, he is confused, able to state name, 
denies SOB, says minimal LLE pain, unable to answer further 
questions. Please see above plan for subsequent CODE BLUE, 
patient passed away within 2.5 hours of admission.

IMAGING:
============
___ CXR: AP portable supine view of the chest.  A right IJ 
central venous catheter is noted terminating in the low SVC near 
the cavoatrial junction.  Calcific  density projects over the 
heart in the expected region of the mitral annulus.  There is a 
small right pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is  
noted.  Opacity in the right mid and lower lung is concerning 
for pneumonia  versus the sequelae of aspiration.  
Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears  grossly within normal 
limits.  Bony structures are intact. 

___ ___
FINDINGS:  There is generalized subcutaneous edema in the pelvis 
to
the foot, nonspecific.  There is minimal intramuscular edema in 
the
anterolateral thigh and moderate intramuscular edema at the 
posterior
thigh, more confluent posteromedially, posterior to the gracilis
muscle, for example.
 
A right knee prosthesis produces prominent artifact at the knee 
level.
 
No soft tissue emphysema is identified.  No discrete walled-off 
fluid
collection is identified.
 
Vascular calcifications are present.
 
IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific diffuse and extensive right lower 
extremity
edema greatest in the subcutaneous soft tissues.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of a knee replacement 9 weeks ago, atrial 
fibrillation on Coumadin, diabetes  presents with 2 days of 
right leg swelling, found to be hypotensive, transferred to MICU 
for shock. 

#Shock: 
#RLE induration, cellulitis: presented in 2 pressor shock, with 
overt indurated RLE infection, subsequent GNR bacteremia, with 
profound metabolic acidosis and renal failure. He was tachypnic 
to the ___, with altered mental status. IV norepinephrine and 
vasopressin continued, broad spectrum antibiotics started. He 
had worsening respiratory status, and within about an hour of 
admission, started becoming apneic and had profound hypotension. 
Code called as below. Family- ___ and ___ 
updated throughout course. Mr. ___ was fairly healthy and thus 
had not discussed specific code status, but family felt that he 
would not want resuscitation. Absent finalized wished, a code 
was called. After initial ROSC, wife ___ chose to make him 
DNR.

CODE BLUE and Death Note 
Code called around 21:40 
Patient death time: 22:20

Patient was found altered and apneic and lost a pulse with a 
rhythm deemed to be PEA arrest, inconsistent blood pressures. He 
was on levophed and vasopressin initially. He ultimately 
received 5 rounds of epinephrine, two rounds of bicarbonate, 1 
amp, and
one shock (transient period of what appeared to be Vtach).  He 
was intubated and a bedside echo showed preserved RV 
function,but globally reduced global LV function.  ROSC was 
achieved after approximately 13 minutes. An epinephrine drip was 
started. There were numerous broken ribs.  His ___, 
was present with her family. His wife, ___, was called and 
decision to make him DNR. A left radial A-line was placed to 
correlate blood pressures, and soon after placement, blood 
pressures downtrended with asystole.

Death at 10:20 ___. On exam, no pupillary or corneal response, no 
cardiac sounds, no pulses. His wife was called again with family 
above, no autopsy requested, case reported to medical examiner 
and waived case.
