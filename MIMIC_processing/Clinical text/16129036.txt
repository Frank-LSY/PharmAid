REPORTS
=========
CATH ___
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel trifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending, Left Circumflex, and Ramus 
Intermedius.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a Medium caliber vessel.
There is a 70% stenosis in the mid to distal segment, the LAD is 
a tortuous vessel and the area of
stenosis in the LAD caliber diminishes to a small caliber, 
estimated < 2.0 mm
The Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel. There is a 90% stenosis
in the proximal segment.
Name: ___ MRN: ___ Study Date: ___ 15:29:50 p. 
___
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
RI: The Ramus Intermedius, which arises from the LM, is a medium 
caliber vessel. There is a 50%
stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Superior lateral of the RI, arising from the mid segment, is 
a medium caliber vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a medium caliber vessel. There is a
50% stenosis in the proximal segment.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
Interventional Details
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) was performed on an ad
hoc basis based on the coronary angiographic findings from the 
diagnostic portion of this procedure. A 6
___ EBU3.5 guide provided adequate support. Crossed with a 
Prowater wire into the distal LCx.
Predilated with a 2.0 mm balloon and then deployed a 2.75mm x 
15mm DES. Postdilated with a
2.75mm balloon in the proximal segment of the stent upto 18 ATM. 
Final angiography revealed normal
flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis.
Sedation
The procedure was not feasible without moderate sedation. Risks, 
benefits and alternatives were
discussed and informed consent obtained. With rhythm, blood 
pressure and oxygen saturation monitors,
constant nursing observation, and direct attending supervision, 
the patient received an appropriate level
of sedation (see medication list ). The attending was at the 
bedside continuously for 54 min during
sedation. The patient was subsequently observed with serial 
examinations until the return of pre-sedation
mental status.
Complications
There were no clinically significant complications.
Findings
 Two vessel coronary artery disease, the proximal LCx appears 
to be the clinical culprit lesion
(the stenosis in the LAD is in the mid to distal segment and the 
caliber of the LAD is
significantly diminished at this level)
 Successful PCI of the proximal LCx with a 2.75 x 15 mm DES
Name: ___ MRN: ___ Study Date: ___ 15:29:50 p. 
___
Recommendations
 ASA 81 + ___ 75mg/day for min of 12 months post PCI
 Secondary prevention of CAD
 Further recommendations as per inpatient Cardiology service

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with prior history of hypertension, uncontrolled T2DM (A1c 
9.5 in ___ -> 7.0 in ___, erectile dysfunction, presenting 
with four days of substernal / left-sided chest pain which was 
also radiating into left arm, found to have elevated troponin 
c/f type I NSTEMI.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] New medications:
- aspirin 81, clopidogrel 75mg daily (DAPT)
- metoprolol succinate XL 25mg daily
- atorvastatin 80mg qHS

[ ] Patient underwent coronary catheterization on ___ and 
a single DES was placed in the proximal LCx
[ ] Patient with elevated triglycerides on lipid panel, ___ 173. 
Would consider agent to lower triglycerides.
[ ] HA1C slightly elevated to 6.5%.
[ ] Patient needs an echocardiogram to assess LV function. 
Inpatient team has tried to schedule this for you as soon as 
possible in the ___ office.
[ ] Patient to schedule appointment with PCP one week after 
discharge and with Cardiology in ___ weeks. He was provided with 
contact information.

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# NSTEMI
Patient with cardiac risk factors admitted for EKG concerning 
for ischemia and elevated troponins. He was given a full 
strength aspirin and started on a heparin gtt until the time of 
cardiac catheterization. He was taken to the Catheterization Lab 
on ___ and 1 DES was placed in the LCx, with right radial 
access. There was also some diffuse CAD in other smaller vessels 
which we will manage medically. There were no complications from 
the procedure. The patient was initiated on aspirin and 
clopidogrel upon discharge. He will have a TTE as an outpatient 
soon after discharge.

# ASCVD (risk ___
New medications:
- metoprolol XL 25mg. 
- atorvastatin 80mg. 

# dyslipidemia
Patient noted to have A1C 6.5. Also, he was noted to have 
elevated lipids with elevated triglycerides in particular. He 
was initiated on a high dose statin. He will benefit from 
ongoing close management of his cardiac risk factors.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

Why was I hospitalized?
=======================
You came to the hospital with chest pain.

What happened to me while I was in the hospital?
=================================================
You were monitored on continuous cardiac monitoring.

You went for a coronary angiogram. There was a blockage in one 
of the arteries to the heart that we believe was causing your 
symptoms. A stent was placed in the artery to allow for improved 
blood flow.

You were started on medication to prevent a clot in the blood 
vessels of the heart. It is very important that you do NOT miss 
___ day of ___ (clopidogrel).

Your other medications were adjusted for a better regimen of 
medications to protect your heart.

What should I do when I am discharged from the hospital?
==========================================================
Please make sure to take all of your medications as prescribed. 
Please make sure to go to all of your doctor's appointments.

We wish you the best! Best wishes for a wonderful new year!

Your ___ Care team
