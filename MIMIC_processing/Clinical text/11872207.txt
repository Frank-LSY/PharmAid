History of Present Illness:
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, ___, in
___ at the ___
today.  As you may recall, she is a delightful ___ 
female
who is referred to me for right ICA aneurysm.  This initially
came to light after she had a lymph node in her neck that was
involved with MRI.  Followup concerning for a right ICA 
aneurysm.
She was set up for a pipeline and underwent angiogram under
anesthesia on ___.  At that time, it was felt that the
aneurysmal cavernous and procedure is aborted.  We saw her with 
a
CTA on ___.  Continues to be concerned that this is
paraophthalmic lesion in CTA.  With that information in mind and
her young age, we brought her in again to discuss treatment.

I had a long discussion today with Ms. ___ regarding the
new onset of her particular aneurysm.  I explained the only way
to truly understand the location of this aneurysm is with a
direct surgical infection, which is not possible.  For that
reason, because there is a chance it may have intracranial
extension and she is a young age with a long time for potential
rupture risk and there is safe treatment that we can offer that
she likely take care of it.  We think it is prudent to offer
treatment at this time.  I also discussed that continued
observation is reasonable.

She is going to rush in the summer, but would like to proceed in
the ___.  She prefers ___.  We tentatively scheduled her 
for
___.  She has already been platelet function
testing and found to be a Plavix responder.  She does not need
repeat testing.  We can start her with only a few days in 
advance
the procedure.  We discussed the need for dual antiplatelets for
three months.  She is interested in proceeding and we have made
those plans.  We will keep you apprised of her care as things
progress.
