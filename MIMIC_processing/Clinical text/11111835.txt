Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after a laparoscopic redo 
___ for surgical management of your structuring small 
bowel Crohn's disease. You have recovered from this procedure 
well and you are now ready to return home. Samples from your 
colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology 
department for analysis. You will receive these pathology 
results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent 
need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these results they 
will contact you before this time. You have tolerated a regular 
diet, are passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain 
medications by mouth. You may return home to finish your 
recovery.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patientÂ’s to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call 
the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: 
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or extended constipation.  
 
You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures and a skin glue called 
Dermabond. These are healing well however it is important that 
you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness of the incision lines, 
white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the 
incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or 
swelling of the area. Please call the office if you develop any 
of these symptoms or a fever. You may go to the emergency room 
if your symptoms are severe.  

You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. 
The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with 
steri-strips (little white adhesive strips) instead of 
Dermabond, these will fall off over time, please do not remove 
them. Please no baths or swimming for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team.
 
You will be prescribed narcotic pain medication 
oxycodone/oxycontin. This medication should be taken when you 
have pain and as needed as written on the bottle. This is not a 
standing medication. You should continue to take Tylenol for 
pain around the clock and you can also take Advil. Please do not 
take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours. Do not drink 
alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please 
do not drive a car while taking narcotic pain medication.
  
No heavy lifting greater than 6 lbs for until your first 
post-operative visit after surgery. Please no strenuous activity 
until this time unless instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ 
Dr. ___.  
 
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual 
activities.
