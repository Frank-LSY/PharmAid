Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with asthma and known symptomatic 
cholelithiasis who was scheduled for a cholecystectomy one 
week's time from the day of her presentation. On the day of her 
presentation, she called into the clinic with complaints of 
RUQ/R flank pain, tachycardia, and subjective fevers. At that 
time she was asked to present to the ER for further evaluation. 
Upon arrival she was evaluated and worked up for cholecystitis v 
symptomatic cholelithiasis v nephrolithiasis. RUQ U/S 
demonstrated a non-obstructing gallbladder stone. CT scan of the 
abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 3mm non-obstructing right 
kidney stone, but no evidence of acute pathology in either the 
abdomen or the pelvis. 

Given her presentation, she was admitted to the hospital for 
non-operative management with IV fluids and unasyn as well as 
further evaluation. She did develop a fever on ___. 
Bloodwork demonstrated that she had become leukopenic, as well 
as neutropenic. She was then placed on neutropenic precautions. 
Because of improving RUQ abdominal pain and radiologic studies 
demonstrating no signs of acute cholecystitis, it was felt that 
the source of her neutropenia was unlikely to be due to her 
gallbladder. At this time, consults to both the Infectious 
Disease and Hematology/Oncology teams were placed. 

Evaluation from the Heme/Onc team and review of the peripheral 
blood smear revealed little concern for a hematologic source for 
the neutropenia. Rather, it was felt that the reaction was 
likely due to an infectious process. The ID team, after 
examining and evaluating the patient tested for several 
infectious processes including: mycoplasma, Lyme disease, 
babesia, and anaplasma. Additionally, Unasyn was stopped for 
concern of a drug reaction. Doxycycline was initiated. 

We continued to closely monitor the patient's vital signs as 
well as her clinical progress. She did develop a non-pruritic, 
reticular rash of her upper and lower extremities bilaterally 
one day prior to discharge. This rash resolved on the next 
hospital day. She was hemodynamically stable throughout her 
admission and her condition continued to improve gradually.

Because of her resolved symptoms and resolution of her 
neutropenia. After several days of improved symptomatology and 
resolution of her neutropenia, she was discharged prior to 
return of all of her infectious disease laboratory testing. 
Because of the pending results there was close hand-off of 
information with her primary care physician, ___ ___. 
After close communication with the ID team, it was felt that the 
patient's symptoms and neutropenia were likely due to a viral 
illness. Because of this, the patient's doxycycline was stopped 
with a plan to restart the medication if the outstanding test 
results returned positive. The patient and her PCP, ___, 
___ both informed of this plan and in agreement.
