Chief Complaint:
Right paraophthalmic ICA Aneurysm 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ - Pipeline embolization of Right paraophthalmic ICA 
Aneurysm 
 
History of Present Illness:
___ years old and has
history of lung cancer in ___.  She quit smoking ___ years ago.  


She has no family history of aneurysms, but does have vertigo 
and
in evaluation of vertigo, MRI/MRA study was obtained and
suggested the possibility of intracranial aneurysm.  Follow up 
CT
angiogram was obtained, which showed two things.  One was a
venous anomaly in the left hemisphere, which is a fairly good
sized, but have no clinical significance that we know of.  She
does have a right internal carotid artery paraclinoid aneurysm,
which appears to be approximately 6-7 mm in diameter.  I have
discussed this with the patient and her husband and I do plan to
review all her films at our weekly neurovascular conference.  

I do not think this accounts for any of her vertiginous 
symptoms.
 Her vertigo is such that she gets out of bed at night and feels
dizzy or when she moves her head quickly, she feels dizzy and I
think this could be benign positional vertigo and we may well
investigate for any maneuver with physical therapy to assist 
with
this.  I spent approximately 40 minutes with the patient and her
husband, of which over half was spent in counseling and film
review.  We reviewed the natural history of aneurysms as well as
potential treatment options of endovascular and surgical
management.  I think her lesion were to be treated, this would
take the form of endovascular approach and possibly placement of
a flow diverter.  She understands and wants us to proceed with
our evaluation.  She was grossly intact from a neurologic
standpoint on today's evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Right ICA Aneurysm s/p pipeline embolization
___ is a ___ year old female with right ICA anerusym 
who presents for elective pipeline embolization. Patient 
presented to the pre-op area, was assessed by anesthesia and 
taken to the OR on ___ for pipeline embolization of right 
ICA aneurysm. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see 
formal op report in OMR for further intra operative details. The 
patient was transferred to the PACU for psot op care. Patient's 
groin access was perclosed, but patient continued to have 
bleeding. Pressure was held and patient remained flat for 
extended time. On ___ the patient remained neurologically 
intact on examination.

#New O2 Requirement
The patient was noted to have a new O2 requirement of 3L post 
procedure. A CXR was performed which revealed mild pulmonary 
vascular congestion and elevation of R hemidiaphragm. Duonebs 
were ordered and Incentive Spirometry encouraged.
On ___ she was weaned successfully of the O2 and patient did 
not have any SOB or chest pain, was able to do 1.5lt on IS 

#Tachycardia, resolved
The patient was noted to have tachycardia which reached into the
