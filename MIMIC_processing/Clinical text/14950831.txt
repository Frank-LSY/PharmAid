Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with a past medical history noted of alcohol 
use disorder who presented with a request for detoxification.

# Alcohol withdrawal:
# Possible cirrhosis on imaging:
# Alcohol-induced gastritis

Presented for detox. No history of complicated withdrawal per 
his report. Monitored on CIWA protocol and telemetry for 72hrs 
following his last drink without major issues.  RUQ US 
suggestive of possible underlying cirrhosis. He was advised to 
f/u with his PCP and hepatology as an outpatient for further 
workup of RUQ U/S findings. He was discharged home on MVI, 
thiamine and folate. He was also discharged on oral PPI given 
reports of epigastric pain and concern for alcohol-induced 
gastritis. SW and CM followed the pt throughout his stay to help 
coordinate outpatient detox plan.

# Alcoholic hepatitis
He presented with transaminitis.  Hepatitis serologies were 
negative but showed hepatitis B immunity.  This is likely 
related to alcoholic hepatitis.  He was recommended to follow-up 
with outpatient hepatology once he is able to stabilize his 
medical care and find a primary care doctor and clarify his 
current insurance status.

# Elevated lactate, improved w/ hydration

# Thrombocytopenia, stable
Hepatitis serologies negative.  Likely related to bone marrow 
suppresson and alcohol abuse.
