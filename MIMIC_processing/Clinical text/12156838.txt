Discharge Instructions:
Brain Hemorrhage with Surgery

Surgery
 You underwent a surgery called burr holes to have blood 
removed from your brain. 
 Please keep your staples along your incision dry until they 
are removed.
 It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
 Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
 We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.
 You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your 
activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. 
___ try to do too much all at once.
 No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
 If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
 No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
 Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
 You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This 
medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this 
medication as indicated on your discharge instruction. It is 
important that you take this medication consistently and on 
time. 
 You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

remembering new information.

 Feeling more tired, restlessness, irritability, and mood 
swings are also common.
 You may also experience some post-operative swelling around 
your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 
 You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 
 Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription 
pain medications), try an over-the-counter stool softener.
Headaches:
 Headache is one of the most common symptoms after a brain 
bleed. 
 Most headaches are not dangerous but you should call your 
doctor if the headache gets worse, develop arm or leg weakness, 
increased sleepiness, and/or have nausea or vomiting with a 
headache. 
 Mild pain medications may be helpful with these headaches but 
avoid taking pain medications on a daily basis unless prescribed 
by your doctor.

headaches: avoid caffeine, get enough sleep, daily exercise, 
relaxation/ meditation, massage, acupuncture, heat or ice packs.
