Pertinent Results:
LABS:

IMAGING:
___ 10:10 AM CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC &
RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
There is loss of gray-white matter differentiation in the right
frontal operculum compatible with acute infarct. There is no
evidence of acute hemorrhage. Mild prominence of the ventricles
and sulci suggest involutional changes.
 
Partial opacification of the right sphenoid sinus. The remaining
visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells,
and middle ear cavities are clear. The visualized portion of the
orbits are unremarkable.
 
CTA HEAD:
There is abrupt cutoff of the right M2 segment (4:293) 
compatible
with occlusion. The remaining vessels of the circle of ___ 
and
their principal intracranial branches appear normal without
stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation. The dural venous
sinuses are patent.
 
CTA NECK:
The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches
appear normal with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion. There 
is
no evidence of internal carotid stenosis by NASCET criteria.
 
CT PERFUSION:
Cerebral blood flow < 30% volume: 35 mL
T-max > 6.0 seconds volume: 89 mL
Mismatch volume: 54 mL
Mismatched ratio: 2.5
 
OTHER:
The visualized portion of the lungs are clear. The visualized
portion of the
thyroid gland is within normal limits. a 1.1 cm subcarinal lymph
node (4:4)
noted.

Echocardiogram: 
Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic 
dysfunction most consistent with
single vessel coronary artery disease (distal RCA). MIldly 
dilated thoracic aorta. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified. No definite cardiac source of 
embolism seen.

Liver ultrasound: 
  
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease 
including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded 
on the basis of this examination. 
2. 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm echogenic hepatic lesion is possibly a 
hemangioma, 
however not fully characterized by ultrasound. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of CAD 
c/b MI s/p CABG, PE (not on anticoagulation), HTN, and recent 
suspected diagnosis of Lyme disease  presenting with acute-onset 
left-sided weakness. He was found to have an acute M2 cutoff and 
was taken for thrombectomy. He had a successful reperfusion TICI 
3 after one pass. He was subsequently admitted to the stroke 
service for further work-up and monitoring. 

#Acute R MCA infarct s/p Thrombectomy: 
Etiology unknown but presumed possibly cardioembolic given his 
history of coronary artery disease 
Risk factors: A1c: 5.8 , TSH: 79, LDL: 79
- Patient underwent a TTE which was negative for any source of 
thromboembolism of ASD
-He was continued on ASA, clopidogrel 
-MRI brain revealed acute infarct in the R MCA territory 
involving the inferior division. He also had evidence of small 
hemorrhages in the stroke bed due to reperfusion injury. 
He was counseled that because of temporal lobe is involved this 
is an epileptogenic area and may result in seizures further on. 
He did not show any evidence of seizures during his 
hospitalization.
-Patient was started on fluoxetine 20mg daily to promote 
mood/motor recovery 
-Patient was started on atorvastatin 40mg daily 
-Antiphospholipid antibodies and d-dimer were also sent 
-Regarding his etiology , he likely has paroxysmal afib. We 
discussed with the patient for him to be started on 
eliquis/apixaban in ___ days after a repeat ct scan is done to 
ensure the hemorrhages from the stroke are not worse. If CT 
stable he will start 5mg BID of eliquis and STOP the aspirin and 
Plavix
-We have also ordered the patient for ___ of hearts monitor 
to look for pAF. We would like his pcp/cardiologist to consider 
linq or ziopatch to further monitor for paroxysmal afib more 
long-term 
-His cardiologist is to also order a Factor V-Leiden to complete 
a hypercoaguable stroke work up 

#Lyme Disease + thrombocytopenia: 
-Patient's lyme titers were obtained from ___ and he had 
a positive igM lyme. His doxycycline was continued. 
Thrombocytopenia in setting of lyme disease. Remained stable 

#Elevated LFTs: 
LFTs elevated but downtrending, most likely sequelae of Lyme 
- RUQUS was done and showed steatohepatitis 
-PCP to ___ LFTs. Recommend re-checking in about 1-week

with zio patch or linq (Discretion of cardiologist ) 
 - Please send Factor V ___ in outpatient setting to complete

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left sided weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  

1. Heart disease 
2. High blood pressure, High cholesterol 

We are changing your medications as follows:  
1. Please continue taking Aspirin and Plavix for the next ___ 
days. You will be scheduled to have an outpatient CT scan on 
___. We have ordered you for a CT scan of your brain to be 
done on ___. If you do not hear from radiology please call 
___ to ensure you are scheduled.

 If the CT scan is stable we will ask your PCP/Cardiologist to 
start you on the medication apixaban/eliquis and stop the 
___. 

We also will ask your PCP/Cardiologist to have you wear a holter 
monitor for the next few weeks to monitor for an irregular heart 
beat that makes you prone to having strokes. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
  
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
