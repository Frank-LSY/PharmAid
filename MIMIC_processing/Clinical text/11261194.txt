History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of
coronary artery disease not on any medications, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, with poor physician ___, who presents with
2 week history of left-sided headache, neck pain, and
intermittent word finding difficulties.  History provided by
discussion from patient.

The patient reports he was in his usual state of health until 2
weeks ago, at which point he developed gradual onset of left 
neck
pain and headache.  The pain is described as a sensation of 
"heat
", "muscle tightness," and "numbness" sensation.  It begins in
the area of the left trapezius, radiating superiorly throughout
the entire occipital area, extending to the vertex.  Pain came 
on
gradually and has been persistent since.  Prior to onset of
symptoms, he denies any recent trauma, denies any recent heavy
lifting, denies any recent chiropractic or neck manipulations. 
He did have a recent upper respiratory infection or flu like
illness ___ weeks prior, characterized by productive cough and
malaise, which has resolved.

More recently, over the last ___ days, he has had difficulty
speaking.  Specifically, he notes that his tongue intermittently
feels heavy and he has difficulty articulating speech.  Denies
any difficulty understanding or expressing speech.  He reports 
he
knows what to say the words can come out, however the
articulation is limited during this periods the last episode was
yesterday.  He has difficulty quantifying the duration of these
episodes, estimating that it may be anywhere from several 
minutes
up to an hour.

The only other symptom patient notes is that for several days
last week, he had persistent thoracic back pain that radiated
towards the chest, described as a "heart burning sensation ", 
not
relieved with Tums or other antacid medications.  This incision
has resolved as well. 

Of note, patient has a history of Coronary artery disease with 2
prior MIs.  He is not on any medication for this, despite being
told by physicians in the past they should be on aspirin, as 
well
as antihypertensive and statin medications.  He tells me he has
not seen a physician ___ ___ years. He did have an ED visit in
___ to ___ for headache and knee pain, found to have a
reassuring neurologic exam and knee pain was attributed to
bursitis; he was discharged home.

in the left MCA and ACA with apparent decreased arborization of 
the distal 
left MCA branches.  The remainder the intracranial circulation 
is 
unremarkable. 
4. No intracranial infarct visualized, but please note that MRI 
may be more 
sensitive.

hyperintensity of the 
distal cervical ICA compatible with intramural hematoma and 
dissection. 
3. Poor flow seen in the petrous segment of the left ICA with

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia non-compliant with statin therapy, coronary 
artery disease non-compliant with aspirin therapy and poor PCP 
follow up who presented with 2 weeks of left sided headache, 
neck pain and intermittent word finding difficulties. He had a 
non focal examination on presentation with some mild left neck 
and head pain and initial word finding difficulty that resolved 
on day 1 of admission. He was admitted to the neurology service 
and was found to have left ICA narrowing to complete occlusion 
on CTA s/p left ICA dissection. Suspect TIA as well given word 
finding difficulties. His TIA was likely related to occlusion of 
his ICA secondary to dissection. He underwent a brain MRI which 
showed no evidence of acute infarct on MRI. He was started on IV 
heparin and warfarin was initiated however patient remained 
subtherapeutic INR 1 on 5 mg warfarin so he was transitioned to 
___ with plan to continue this until follow up with PCP who 
could then bridge to warfarin. He complained of left sided 
headache, neck pain and tooth pain which was managed with 
Tylenol and tramadol. He had no deficits on exam on day of 
discharge. 

His stroke risk factors include the following:  
- Coronary artery disease, prior heart attacks
- Hyperlipidemia (LDL 166); simvastatin 20 mg initiated with 
plan to increase if tolerated
- Pre-diabetes (HgA1c 5.8%)
- Hypertension

Transitional issues

Dr. ___ phone number 
___, fax number ___, Address ___, scheduled for ___ @ 1pm; office called and 
provided with summary of hospitalization on ___
[ ] Patient discharged on ___ with plan for PCP to start 
warfarin, INR goal ___, which should be continued until 
neurology follow up in 3 months

outpatient
for LDL 166
[ ] avoid NSAIDs while on anticoagulation if possible
[ ] avoid heavy lifting (greater than 15 lb), strenuous physical

[ ] needs outpatient follow up with dentist to evaluate for 
primary dental problem as etiology of left sided tooth pain 
although may be related to dissection
[ ] Polycythemia noted during hospitalization, continue to 
monitor

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache, neck pain and 
word finding difficulties resulting from a CAROTID ARTERY CLOT 
AND DISSECTION CAUSING TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK. This is a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot due to a tear in the lining of 
the artery wall. This caused brief decreased oxygen to your 
brain. The clot is still in the blood vessel. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Coronary artery disease, prior heart attacks
- Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)
- Pre-diabetes (HgA1c 5.8%)
- High blood pressure

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
- start simvastatin 20 mg nightly, your primary care doctor ___ 
increase this if you tolerate it 
- start lovenox (enoxaparin) and continue until you see your 
primary care doctor
- please start warfarin 5 mg daily on ___, 2 days prior to your 
primary care doctor appointment on ___

You have had some neck pain and headache during your admission 
that is related to the clot in your neck. Your tooth pain may be 
related to this as well however if you have had the tooth pain 
for a long time it may be related to a primary dental issue. 
Please make an appointment to see your dentist. Make sure your 
dentist knows you are receiving anticoagulation. 

It is very important that you take your medications as 
prescribed given your risk for bleeding and ischemic stroke. 

Please avoid heavy lifting (greater than 15 lb), strenuous 
physical activity and neck manipulation. Avoid NSAIDs (advil) as 
much as possible while receiving anticoagulation. 

You will have a repeat MRI in 3 months to make sure that this 
dissection is healing. It is important to ___ in neurology 
clinic to get clearance to stop taking the blood thinner. 

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  

Your ___ Neurology Team
