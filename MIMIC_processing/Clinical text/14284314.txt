feeling unwell after dinner (had some ___ food and 2 mojitos)

Patient laid down at home, began to feel better, then got up and
walked to door, and shortly afterwards lost consciousness and
fell (does not recall falling, her sister heard her fall and 
came
and found her).  No tongue biting or incontinence, no 
palpitations, recalls all details of her fall.   Her sister 
helped her up to the sofa.  She felt
unwell ___, and had aches and pains from the fall. She went 
to
her PCP, and was noted to have lower BP than usual for her
(101/60), and was advised to decrease BP meds and drink more
fluids. Blood work was sent. She was called back and told she 
was
anemic and needed to go to the ER for a blood transfusion.  She
denies blood in her stool/dark stools, denies heavy periods
(periods last ___ days), but had irregular/heavy periods many
years ago but not recently.  She is menstruating presently. She 
has begun to notice some dyspnea on exertion, denies chest 
pain/palpitations. For the last 6
months or so she has felt like she gets lightheaded when she 
gets
up quickly, has to move slowly when changing positions.  She
denies abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers.  She feels 
that she is generally dehydrated as she is not drinking adequate 
water and is having caffeinated drinks.  

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.8 94 126/62 16 100% RA.  Stool
was guaiac negative.  Labs showed hemoglobin 6.6, creatinine 1.2
from 0.6, bicarbonate 20.  UA showed 3 WBC, 1 RBC, few bacteria. 

Patient received 2 units PRBCs with improvement to hemoglobin
7.9.  Type and screen was sent.  She received acetaminophen 1000
mg PO and 1 liter NS.

Currently, the patient reports feeling much better after
transfusion.  There is no more lightheadedness or dyspnea.  She
has no chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
diabetes, prior gastric bypass, B12 deficiency, who presents 
with
anemia and syncope.

# Syncope:  Likely due to worsening anemia, use of blood 
pressure medications, dehydration (poor water intake).  No 
events seen on telemetry.  Patient has had other syncopal 
episodes soon on standing, likely also due to same combination 
of factors.  
 
# Iron Deficiency Anemia: Ferritin of 3.4.  Given lack of iron 
dextran, we were unable to replace her iron deficit, which is 
2.5 grams of iron.  She did receive 2 units of prbc, amounting 
to approximately 500 mg of iron, and was given 125 mg of IV 
ferrous gluconate on the medical floor, making for a receipt of 
625 mg of iron.  She has ___ mg iron deficit remaining.  Given 
poor tolerance and absorbption of oral iron she was advised to 
have outpatient iv iron infusions.  
Iron deficiency likely due to inadequate iron absorbption due to 
gastric bypass, and stool guiaic x 1 was negative.  PCP can also 
perform more stool guiaic testing or refer to GI for ___ to 
r/o occult GI blood loss.  
Her hematocrit did not rise appropriately to 2 unit prbc 
infusion, but did go up substantially (24.3 to 27.8).  This is 
likely due to some dilution effect of IVF and the fact that she 
has ongoing blood loss due to her menses.  
Variety of morphologies on blood smear likely due to profound 
iron deficiency.

# Acute kidney injury: creatinine 1.2 from baseline 0.6,
responsive to IVFs.  Likely related to volume depletion.  
Patient advised to refrain from NSAIDs.

# Hypertension: hold home chlorthalidone for now; lisinopril 
recently held as well.  She was normotensive in the hospital 
despite holding both blood pressure agents; expect that her BP 
will rise soon given receipt of prbc, and PCP can consider 
restart of low dose anti-hypertensive.  
 
# Diabetes: ___ check finger sticks and place
on insulin sliding scale

# s/p Gastric bypass: patient is on vitamin B12, but should
likely also be on iron, folate and thiamine supplementation. 
She was advised to start a multi vitamin at home.

Greater than ___ hour spent on care on day of discharge.

___:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
1.  Iron deficiency anemia
2.  Acute kidney injury - resolved

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after losing consciousness at home.  We 
believe that this was due to having a low blood pressure that 
stemmed from anemia (low blood count) and being on two very 
strong blood pressure medicines.  Consuming a meal and having 
some alcohol may have also contributed to lower pressures as 
well.

Your anemia is from iron deficiency which is likely from you not 
absorbing iron well on account of your gastric bypass.  You were 
given two units of blood and were given IV iron.  Please discuss 
with Dr ___ how to get IV iron as an outpatient.  Also, we did 
not find blood in your stool, which suggests that you are not 
bleeding from your GI tract, but Dr ___ continue to have 
your stool checked to make sure that we are not missing 
anything.  Please buy a multivitamin with iron and take one 
every day.

I suspect that your other episodes of passing out are due to 
some combination of these factors, but Dr ___ also 
consider getting a monitor of your heart to be sure that you are 
not having an abnormal heart rhythm that would result in you 
passing out.  
 
Followup Instructions:
