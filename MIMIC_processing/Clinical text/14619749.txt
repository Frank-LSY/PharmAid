cath on ___ and started to develop pain and swelling in the RLQ. 
 Imaging revealed a pseudoaneurysm with active extravasation of 
the right external iliac and retroperoneal hemotoma.  She was 
admitted to ___ on ___ for repair of the bleeding.

She underwent a right lower extremity angiogram with left 
femoral artery access with Dr. ___ on ___.  The

tolerated well by the patient.  After the procedure she 
recovered in the PACU and then transferred to the Vascular 
surgery floor for the remainder of her admission.  After the 
procedure her diet was advanced to a house diet which she 
tolerated well.  She was able to void on her own in QS.  She was 
encouraged to get OOB and ambulated independently.

On POD2, patient underwent a CTA of the abdomen to confirm 
stabilization of the pseudoaneurysm bleeding.  The CTA confirmed 
that the graft repair was well sealed.

Patient will be prescribed ASA 81 mg daily for graft patency.

A CBC completed on POD2 revealed the patient with asymptomatic 
acute blood loss anemia.  She was transfused 1 unit of PRBC and 
had an appropriate bump in her H/H.

Patient has a PMH of atrial fibrillation which was stable 
throughout her hospitalization.  Her home medication, xarelto, 
was re-started on POD2.

Patient has a PMH of hypertension, which was stable throughout 
her admission.  Her home medications, fleicanide and nadolol 
were continued with systolic BP parameters in place.

Patient will need to follow up with vascular surgery with a 
lower extremity non-invasive studies and an office visit in one 
month.

Patient is discharged home in an improved and stable condition

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were transferred from an outside hospital 
for further evaluation of an injury to your right external iliac 
artery that occurred during your recent cardiac catheterization. 
 We covered the injured artery with a stent during an angiogram. 
   To do the procedure, a small puncture was made in your left 
groin artery.  The puncture site heals on its own: there are no 
stitches to remove.   You tolerated the procedure well and are 
now ready to be discharged from the hospital.   Please follow 
the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery.

Peripheral Angiography
Puncture Site Care
For one week:
Do not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot 
tub.
Use only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around 
the puncture site. 
Gently pat the puncture site dry after showering. 
Do not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the 
puncture site. 

You may remove the bandage and shower the day after the 
procedure.  You may leave the bandage off. 
You may have a small bruise around the puncture site.  This is 
normal and will go away one-two weeks. 
Activity 
For the first 48 hours: 
Do not drive for 48 hours after the procedure
For the first week:
Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 
pounds
Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold 
your breath or bear down with abdominal muscles.   Take care not 
to put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, 
or moving your bowels.
After one week:
You may go back to all your regular activities, including 
sexual activity.  We suggest you begin your exercise program at 
half of your usual routine for the first few days.   You may 
then gradually work back to your full routine.
Medications:
Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!
