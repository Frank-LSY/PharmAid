Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
R MCA syndrome s/p tPA
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
status post tPA
right carotid stenting and thrombectomy ___

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right handed man with a past medical
history of Eosinophilic Esophagitis and Chronic Hepatitis B who
presents s/p tPA for sudden onset left hemiplegia and mild
neglect, with evidence of a hyperdense R MCA at OSH.

History is gathered from patient at bedside, but is limited. 

In brief, Mr. ___ was at his baseline state of health this
morning when around roughly 8PM he was driving to ___ to 
visit
a friend.  He recalls smelling burning rubber (and thinking that
he blew a car tire).  The next thing he recalled was being on 
the
side of the road following a car accident.  EMS arrived, and due
to concern for a facial droop he was taken to OSH.

There, there was concern for a stroke.  ___ revealed a 
possible
hyperdense Right MCA.  NIHSS was at least 6 (exact details
unclear), with 1 point for Left facial palsy, 1 for dysarthria, 
___nd 1 for leg and arm drift respectively. 
He was given IV tPA roughly 2 hours following onset of symptoms
(roughly 10pm)  He was transferred to ___ for endovascular
consideration.  

Here, NIHSS was 9.  CTA reconfirmed  occlusion of the right
internal carotid artery  distal to the bifurcation, with
re-cannulization exiting the cavernous sinus.  He was taken
urgently for Neurovascular intervention.  Groin puncture was at
00:15 with placement of 1 right ECA stent and 2 Right ICA stents
with carotid recanalization.  Subsequent underwent stent
retrieval and suction catheterization.  During this procedure he
received integrillin and IV heparin per endovascular team.

RoS unable to be fully gathered.  Endorses mild headache.
 
Past Medical History:
Chronic Hepatitis B
Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Splenic Artery Aneurysm
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
Denies any family history of neurologic issues including stroke
or seizure.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ___:
IMPRESSION:
Mildly dilated aortic arch. Normal biventricular cavity sizes 
with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic 
function. No definite structural cardiac source of embolism 
identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ 
ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram 
is suggested in ___ years.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old man with chronic Hep B, splenic art 
aneurysm who presented acutely after new left-sided weakness and 
neglect leading to MVA on ___. On arrival to OSH he was found 
to have NIHSS of 6 and CT showed hyperdense R MCA, was given iv 
tPA at 22:00 and transferred to ___.

# Neuro
At ___ was 8 (LUE went to 2 and sensory deficit noted 
in addition to tactile extinction) and CT/CTA showed R 
extracranial carotid occlusion, right vert dissection and distal 
R M1/M2 occlusion. He was taken urgently for endovacular 
intervention around midnight and had 3 stents placed 
extracranially (1 in the ECA, two in series in the ICA), he had 
clot retreival, and carotid was successfully recanalized at 
01:10 (~5h). He was admitted to the neurology ICU for post-tPA 
care and monitoring. He had an unremarkable course and was 
subsequently transferred to the floor, where his neurologic 
examination continued to improve. Suspected etiology R-ICA 
dissection with R-MCA (M-2) occlusion. Echo and telemetry did 
not suggest alternative cardioembolic source, although he had 
mildly dilated aortic arch on echo without any other associated 
abnormalities for which he needs a follow up study in ___ years 
as recommended by Cardiology guidelines. Evaluation of stroke 
risk factors revealed A1c of 5.3 and LDL of 94. He was started 
ASA 81mg/Plavix 75mg for indefinite secondary stroke prevention. 
SBP goals 120-160 and plan for DriveWise driving clearance as 
outpatient.

Transitional issues:
[ ] continue aspirin 81mg + Plavix 75mg for secondary stroke 
prevention in setting of carotid stent

for mildly dilated aortic arch without any other signs of 
valvular or functional impairment
[ ] recommend interval vascular imaging to evaluate for right 
carotid artery and stent

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left-sided weakness 
leading to a car accident resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we gave you the medication 
for acute stroke (tPA) and took you for angiographic 
intervention (with placement of right internal carotid artery 
stents and clot retrieval).

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- ADDING aspirin 81mg daily and Plavix 75mg daily which you 
should remain on indefinitely.

YOU SHOULD REFRAIN FROM DRIVING until you are evaluated by the 
___ DriveWise Team and are cleared to drive.  We do not think 
there is a serious contraindication for you traveling via plane 
(you asked specifically about an upcoming trip to ___, 
and we think this would be safe).

Your echocardiogram did not show any possible sources of stroke, 
although there was one small unusual finding for which you 
should receive a repeat echocardiogram in ___ years.

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

It was a pleasure taking care of you during this 
hospitalization.

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Neurology Team
