Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman who presented w/ acute 
onset gait instability concerning for TIA/Stroke, found to have 
a normal neurologic exam and negative MRI. 

Transitional Issues 
=====================
[ ] Pt should have an outpatient TTE to complete TIA workup 
[ ] Holding pt's lisinopril because her blood pressure while 
inpatient had SBP 100s-110s, please restart at your discretion 

Ms. ___ presented w/ gait instability, and possible 
veering to the right upon waking for sleep. She denied any frank 
dizziness. She otherwise was feeling at her usual state of 
health prior to the onset of these symptoms. She presented to 
the ED and was admitted to the neurology service for workup and 
consideration of possible TIA/Stroke. Her neurologic exam was 
notable for a +rhomberg and some overall unsteadiness, but was 
largely nonfocal w/o other evidence of posterior circulation 
disfunction. We suspect this is most likely a recurrence of a 
mild peripheral vestibulopathy given a negative MRI and lack of 
exam findings. However given her symptoms were present upon 
waking up, it is difficult to rule out a TIA completely (though 
would be atypical for her to have ongoing symptoms and negative 
imaging). As such, we checked for risk factors, A1c 5.2, and LDL 
124. An outpatient TTE should be considered to complete her 
workup.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You were having some difficulty walking and came to hospital for 
evaluation. You were admitted to rule out a stroke.  

You had an MRI which was negative for stroke. You were seen by 
the physical therapists who recommended outpatient physical 
therapy. We think your symptoms may have been due to vertigo, 
however it is difficult to rule out a "warning stroke" or TIA 
(transient ischemic attack). 

You will need to continue on your aspirin. We started a new 
cholesterol medication called a statin. We are holding your 
medication called lisinopril (because your blood pressures were 
normal). 

It will be important that you take all of your medications and 
go to all of your appointments.
