Chief Complaint:
"I've thought about suicide."

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Over the past few weeks prior to admission, the patient 
experienced increasing
suicidal ideation and over the last three days PTA developed a 
plan to attempt suicide by buying a carbon dioxide container 
online.  He then realized that this method may not be lethal and 
decided against buying the container but continued to have 
suicidal thoughts. He reports fixed beliefs that he is 
worthless, "stupid," and a burden to his family and others. 
Within the last
week  PTA he wrote a 1006 word essay in which he explained 
reasons why
he should no longer be alive.

The patient reports symptoms of depression including depressed 
mood, fatigue/loss of energy, anhedonia, thoughts of death/SI 
(as above), sleep disturbance including insomnia (difficulty 
falling asleep without difficulty staying asleep), fluctuating 
appetite and diet changes (he usually eats one large meal of 
fast food late in the evening which he has delivered due to his 
fear of leaving his home), poor concentration, psychomotor 
agitation (he
states he spends most of the day pacing in his apartment).

Recently he has begun to worry that people around him seek to 
harm him. He specifically worries that other makes might 
physically harm him or that people will "hold [him] in contempt" 
and judge him for his depressive symptoms and
memory/concentration issues. During the interview he reported 
that he worried that one of his good friends have been "planted 
by ___ personnel" in order to spy on the patient. He 
provides a separate example in which his classmates were "too 
nice" to him and he thought that his professor had told the
classmates about his condition and told them to be nice to him.

During the week before admission, he was scheduled to give an 
important presentation in one of his courses. He was able to 
prepare for this presentation
and rehearse multiple times (this ability to prepare is a 
significant functional improvement from the patient's recent 
baseline). When he stood in front of the class to present 
"everything went blank" and he was unable to recall any details 
of his presentation. He began to become severely anxious and 
soon developed physical symptoms including shortness of breath, 
chest pain, palpitations, and diaphoresis (he states he was 
"sweating like a waterfall"). He occasionally develops similar 
physical symptoms when he is anxious but this event was more 
intense than any event previously.

The patient denies symptoms of mania such as erratic behavior, 
grandiosity, increased activity, or decreased need for sleep. 
The patient also denies psychotic symptoms such as auditory or 
visual hallucinations, or thought broadcasting.

questions about medications with the treatment team, and I

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon his worsening 
depression and active suicidal ideation with plan.  Their static 
factors noted at that time include chronic mental illness, 
history of substance abuse, and male gender.   The modifiable 
risk factors addressed included suicidal ideation with plan, 
medication noncompliance, lack of engagement with outpatient 
treatment, hopelessness, social withdrawal, limited social 
supports, limited coping skills, poor reality testing, lack of 
purpose, active substance abuse, and recent personal loss.  
Through group and individual sessions, we offered coping skills 
to help him deal with stress and depressed feelings.  We 
encouraged him to communicate with his family on a regular basis 
and explain to them what he is struggling with.  Through 
motivational interviewing, we encouraged him to quit using 
cannabis.  Additionally, we started him on Sertraline and 
Abilify to help with his depression and paranoid feelings.  
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors,  including help-seeking nature, future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, improved reality 
testing ability and coping skills, lack of suicidal ideation, 
and stronger social supports.  Overall, based on the totality of 
our assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is good.
