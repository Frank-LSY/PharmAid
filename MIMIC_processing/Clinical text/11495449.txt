History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female ___ with mood 
disorder, migraines, brought in by campus EMS after reporting 
suicidal ideation with panic attack after recent lamotrigine 
discontinuation. 

Per ___, MD's ___ initial ED consult note: "Pt is 
a ___ ___ at ___ with PSH of depression and suspected 
bipolar II and PMH of migraines. Pt BIBA after going to the 
___ mental ___ and reporting SI and experiencing a 
panic attack.

Pt states she has been having trouble sleeping and eating this 
week. Pt also reports difficulty concentrating and ongoing 
anxiety. She has skipped going to classes and even when she goes 
she has difficulty concentrating. For the past few days pt has 
had daily ongoing SI, which include thoughts of walking into 
traffic (she does not like this plan because it feels unfair to 
the drivers) and overdosing on medications. She researched which 
pills are used in euthanasia online but became frustrated when 
she could not figure out how to obtain them. She states she has 
not killed herself because she has not figured out the right 
plan to do so. Pt states she feels guilty for being alive 
because there are a lots of people in the world who want to live 
and she does not. She states that the decision to kill yourself 
is not just about bravery, but that it is simply the best option 
for some people. The patient states she has not shared any of 
her mental health concerns with her family because she does not 
want to burden them. She states she has some friends who know 
she sees a psychiatrist but none of them know she is here in the 
emergency department. 

The patient started seeing a counselor and psychiatrist ~2 
months ago due to worsening depressive symptoms. She was started 
on 20 of fluoxetine but the worsened her anxiety and so the dose 
was reduced to 10 mg. She states when her mood failed to improve 
she was started on lamictal because he psychiatrist suspected 
she had bipolar disorder. She says she improved quickly after 
this, and that her psychiatrist decided to stop the lamictal to 
determine if her improvement was due to fluoxetine or the 
lamictal. Pt states that 1.5 weeks after stopping the fluoxetine 
she began to feel more depressed with the symptoms described 
above. The patient has also been experiencing panic attacks 
which she described as a feeling of numbess all over her body 
and hyperventilation. She also perscribes an inability to move 
her hands or hear things. 

Pt states her psychiatrist suspected bipolar disorder because 
she during school she often has large amounts of energy, feels 
very optimistic, and runs on 5 hours of sleep per day. She 
denies grandiosity and cannot give specific examples of 
impulsive behavior or irritability during these periods. Pt 
states she has periods of euthymia, but they are mostly during 
breaks from school when she is less busy. Pt states she thinks 
she had periods of depression starting in high school but did 
not recognize them as such at the time. 

Pt denies HI, AVH, paranoia and ideas of reference.

Patient's therapist ___ emailed Dr. ___ 
this week expressing concerns that patient was doing poorly, 
with increase in SI, sleeping poorly, missing classes. There was

bipolar disorder. Wondering about restarting lamictal.

Yesterday patient came in for an emergency appointment. She was

fall asleep, I get to bed at 6 in the morning. I have no 
appetite." She further shared that yesterday she had a panic 
attack, and thought that "anything would be better than [living 
like this]." Pt states she made multiple plans to commit suicide 
including taking prescription pills and walking in front of 
traffic; ultimately what kept her from the latter was hurting 
other people (in the case of walking into traffic, she would 
feel guilty for involving an innocent driver). Pt also shared a

her because she would be hurting other people. 

Pt shares that yesterday she went to the ___ with a 
panic attack. These panic attacks used to be ___ stress but now

month ago, lasting for 1 week, in which she had elevated energy, 
mood, decreased need for sleep and felt "really happy about 
anything and talked a lot." Pt states that her depression got 
worse when her lamictal was discontinued, and does not feel the

Brief Hospital Course:
DISCHARGE SUMMARY

1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
 On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. They were initially placed on 5min 
minute checks status on admission due to suicidal ideation. Once 
patient was able to contract for safety and demonstrated 
behavioral control, she was liberalized to 15 minute checks 
remained on that level of observation throughout while being 
unit restricted. She was initially restricted from sharps, but 
similarly liberalized to monitored access. No behavioral 
incidents, security intervention, or restraints. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
 #)  Unspecified depressive disorder
 1) On admission to the unit, patient endorsed depressive 
symptoms impairing function and school performance, 
hopelessness, guilt, and psychic pain. She was unable to 
identify future-oriented goals, significant reasons for living.  
She did report periods of elevated energy, increased 
talkativeness, decreased sleep requirements, and some 
disinhibition. Patient also relayed disordered eating with 
binge-eating and reportedly involuntary purging behaviors. 
Patient had worsened panic symptoms without clear precipitant, 
contributing significant distress and suicidality.
 2) Presentation was diagnostically unclear outside of panic 
symptoms and depressive mood disorder.  By history, patient 
experienced significant mood stability on low-dose initiation of 
lamotrigine, with lability upon discontinuation. The timeline 
did not seem consistent with predictable therapeutic effect. 
Patient reported some hypomanic symptoms and possible family 
history of undiagnosed maternal bipolar disorder, so 
consideration was given to bipolar diathesis. Patient also 
endorsed suicidality, emptiness, and affective dysregulation; 
she did not clearly link these to interpersonal triggers but 
strong suspicion for cluster B personality disorder. Personality 
Assessment Inventory was performed and revealed high depression, 
suicidality, borderline personality traits. No evidence of 
mania.  
 3) Intervention included medication titration, 
psychotherapeutic intervention. After discussion with outpatient 
psychiatrist, lamotrigine was resumed; this was titrated to 50mg 
po daily. Her fluoxetine was titrated to 20mg daily, tolerated 
without significant anxiety or akathisia. Given rigid thinking, 
low-dose aripiprazole 2mg was trialed for about 1 week, and 
discontinued given lack of clinical benefit. Trazodone was 
titrated to 50mg po nightly for sleep; patient occasionally 
required PRN hydroxyzine 25mg in addition for insomnia. 
Medication regimen was well-tolerated without significant side 
effect.
 4) Outcome of hospitalization was improved mood, reduced 
anxiety, and increased future-oriented thinking (short-term to 
spend time with family and friends, travel over holiday, return 
to ___ for next semester; more long-term plans of visualization 
of life ___ years from now). Patient continued to endorse death 
wish, with infeasible plan of medically-assisted suicide. She 
denied intrusive and pervasive thoughts of suicide similar to 
prior to admission. On discharge, mental status notable for 
euthymic, reactive affect, linear thinking. She was able to 
contingency plan and amenable to continued aftercare follow-up 
for psychiatry and therapy both locally and in ___. 
 5) Future interventions include further titration of 
lamotrigine; goal of 200mg daily, for mood stabilization and 
affective regulation. Regarding her fluoxetine, patient did 
endorse significant distress around panic symptoms which 
contributed to her suicidality. Thus the decision was made to 
continue titration; which patient appeared to tolerate. Would 
consider further titration with close monitoring for activation 
or hypomanic symptoms on SSRI. If patient is unable to tolerate 
SSRI, would consider monotherapy on lamotrigine to fully assess 
clinical response. Panic symptoms could be targeted with PRN 
anxiolytic; could consider benzodiazepine given lack of 
problematic substance use; patient did utilize hydroxyzine 
occasionally and appropriately during hospital stay. Ideally, 
would like to see patient taper off sleep aids, including 
standing trazodone and PRN hydroxyzine. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS: None present.

4. MEDICAL: No acute medical needs. 

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
 #) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
 The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient intermittently attended these groups that focused on 
teaching patients various coping skills, and often appeared 
overwhelmed and distressed. She was unable to clearly identify 
what was triggering during these occasions. Patient was often 
visible in the milieu, typically bright and sociable with 
age-related peers. She was often seen on computer, watching TV, 
or completing puzzles. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Collateral information was obtained from outpatient 
psychiatrist, therapist, and ___ counseling center. 
Patient initially declined family involvement during her 
admission, but eventually invited team to participate in phone 
meeting with parents (cousins in-person on unit) to disclose 
hospitalization, mental health status, treatment, and aftercare. 
She made travel arrangements to travel from ___ to ___ to 
visit friends in ___, and then to fly from ___ to ___ with 
her cousin. Cousin, aunts, and uncles alerted to hospitalization 
details by patient.

 #) INTERVENTIONS
 - Medications: lamotrigine 50mg po daily, fluoxetine 20mg po 
daily, trazodone 50mg po qhs, hydroxyzine 25mg BID PRN; 
aripiprazole trialed and discontinued
 - Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and 
milieu therapy.
 - Coordination of aftercare: outpatient psychiatry, therapy
 - Behavioral Interventions: encouraged DBT skills, affect 
identification, journaling, behavioral activation
 - Guardianships: none

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
lamotrigine (rash), hydroxyzine (sedation), fluoxetine 
(akathisia), aripiprazole (metabolic effects - less risk, 
abnormal movements) and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.  We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team.  The 
patient appeared able to understand and consented to begin the 
medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
 On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon ego-syntonic 
thoughts of suicide with plan to overdose or run into traffic. 
Their static factors noted at that time include history of 
emotional trauma, chronic mental illness, age, the presence of a 
concurrent personality disorder.  The modifiable risk factors 
included lack of future-oriented thinking, hopelessness, social 
withdrawal, limited coping skills, lack of purpose, polarized 
thinking. These were addressed through medication management, 
coping skills and psychoeducation, reality testing.  Finally, 
the patient is being discharged with many protective risk 
factors, including medication adherence, engagement with 
providers, intelligence, supportive family, no history of 
substance use, no prior suicide attempts. Based on the totality 
of our assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.
