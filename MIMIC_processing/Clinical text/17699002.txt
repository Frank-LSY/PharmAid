Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ after experiencing a fall. You were 
found to have some facial fractures. You were evaluated by the 
plastic surgery team and the ophthalmology team who recommended 
conservative management of your injuries with outpatient follow 
up. You also were evaluated by the cardiology team after you 
were noted to have a brief abnormal heart rhythm. You were 
started on long acting metoprolol to help prevent future 
abnormal heart rhythms and you will follow up as an outpatient 
with cardiology. 

You were started on an antibiotic called Augmentin while at 
___ for a 7 day course to prevent any infections associated 
with your facial fractures. Please take all medication as 
prescribed. You should have no leftover pills.

Sinus Precautions:

Certain precautions will assist healing and we ask that you 
faithfully follow these instructions:

1. Take the prescribed medications as directed.

2. Do not forcefully spit for several days.

3. Do not smoke for several days.

4. Do not use straws for several days.

5. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even 
though your sinus may feel stuffy or there may be some nasal 
drainage.

6. Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If 
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

7. Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew 
on the opposite side of your mouth.

8. Do not rinse vigorously for several days. GENTLE salt water 
swishes may be used. Slight bleeding from the nose is not 
uncommon for several days after the surgery. Please keep our 
office advised of any changes in your condition, especially if 
drainage or pain increases. It is important that you keep all 
future appointments until this condition has resolved.
