tachycardia. Patient denied associated chest pain, dyspnea, or 
lightheadedness. Stated he was anxious about likely diagnosis of 
OSA and being in the hospital. 
Pulmonary: Postoperatively, the patient experienced 
desaturations to the mid 80's for which he was required to be 
placed on supplemental oxygen delivered by CPAP machine. Postop 
chest xray did not demonstrate any acute process, specifically 
no pulmonary edema. Patient was maintained on CPAP on night

Discharge Instructions:
You experienced low oxygen levels after your surgery that 
required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in order to 
be corrected. You likely have an underlying diagnosis of 
obstructive sleep apnea, however a formal sleep study needs to 
be done as an outpatient to confirm this. YOU SHOULD DO THIS AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE. You have been given a prescription to pick up 
a CPAP machine, which you may deploy until you get the sleep 
study done.

Instructions after Tonsillectomy

It is normal to feel tired or washed out after surgery. Rest is 
important and will help you feel better. Walking is also 
important. It will help prevent problems and help you feel 
stronger and have more energy. Just remember to pace yourself 
and rest when you feel tired.

What should I expect after surgery?

surgery.

your throat. This is normal.

How do I manage my pain? 
-Some pain is normal after surgery. 
-For mild pain take acetaminophen (Tylenol). Acetaminophen 
(Tylenol) is contained in many medicines. Do not take Tylenol in 
addition to another product that contains Tylenol such as 
Percocet, Vicodin or Tylenol#3 unless recommended by your 
doctor. Do not take more than 4,000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours. 
-For moderate-to-severe pain you have been given a prescription 
for a pain medication in a group of medicines called "opioids." 
You have the option to request that this prescription be filled 
at a lesser quantity. If you choose to not fill the full 
prescription, you will not be able to receive the rest of the 
prescription at a later date.  
-Be sure to take opioid medication responsibly and as directed. 
Do not drink alcohol/drive/operate machinery while taking opioid 
pain medication. -Please wean your pain medication as your pain 
decreases. 
-Narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation. To make it 
easier to have a bowel movement: 
Drink extra fluids. 
Eat foods high in fiber. 
Take a stool softener like docusate (Colace). Take a stool 
softener while taking any opioid pain medication to prevent 
constipation. 
-Be sure to safely dispose of any unused opioid medication once 
it is no longer needed  
-If your pain medicine is not working, call your doctors 
office.
