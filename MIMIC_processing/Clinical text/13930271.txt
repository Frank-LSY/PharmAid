=== IMAGING === 
- NCHCT: No acute intracranial abnormality

- TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. No atrial septal defect 
is seen on color flow Doppler, but there is early appearance of 
agitated saline/microbubbles in the left atrium/ventricle at 
rest most consistent with an atrial septal defect or stretched 
patent foramen ovale (though a very proximal intrapulmonary 
shunt cannot be fully excluded). The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and regional/global 
systolic function (3D LVEF = 57 %). Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets 
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1) ASD/stretched PFO present.
 2) Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
biventricular regional/global systolic function and type I 
diastolic dysfunction.  

- MRI/MRA Brain and Neck WO Contrast ___. No acute intracranial abnormalities identified. 
2. Unremarkable MRA of the brain and neck. 

- Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler ___
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

- MRV Pelvis ___
Negative for thrombus

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ man with history of TIA ___ y.a.), poor 
medical follow-up (none for ___ yrs.), who presented with acute 
onset dysarthria, R sided weakness and numbness. He came in 
acutely intoxicated (ethanol ___ from a Redsox game. Prior TIA 
___ years ago also right-sided symptoms; also had similar 
symptoms 1.5 months ago while dancing. CT negative for acute 
stroke (CTA not done due to possible contrast allergy). Admitted 
for workup of TIA. His symptoms improved rapidly and he was at 
baseline by the morning following admission. MRI/MRA was 
negative for any acute intracranial processes or vascular 
abnormalities. TTE showed stretched ASD/PFO (only with 
Valsalva). Lower extremity Dopplers were negative for DVT.  An 
MRV of the pelvic veins was done, which found no thrombus. 

He was discharged on aspirin 81mg (which he was supposed to be 
taking since his prior TIA, but had stopped), lisinopril 10mg 
DAILY (for SBPs 150s-170s), and simvastatin 40mg DAILY. He does 
not have insurance so simvastatin was chosen in lieu of 
atorvastatin, as it is on the low-cost medication formulary. 

Follow-up is planned with his PCP back in his home state of 
___. He is also to follow-up with Dr. ___ 
neurology) here, once he obtains insurance. He has 
hypercoagulability labs that were drawn in the hospital and are 
pending. Cardiac monitoring with a 30-day event monitor will be 
deferred for now until we have clearer picture and he has 
established follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of weakness and speech 
difficulties resulting from an TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot, but resolves before any 
permanent damage is done. The brain is the part of your body 
that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so 
damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can 
result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- High Cholesterol
- High Blood Pressure
- Alcohol Use

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- START aspirin 81mg DAILY
- START lisinopril 10mg DAILY  
- START simvastatin 40mg DAILY

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
