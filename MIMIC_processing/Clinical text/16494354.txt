have remained stable. Given unasyn and vancomycin IV. Labs

elevated lipase

RUQ US in our ED shows:
1. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall thickening, concerning 
for
cholecystitis. Recommend correlation with symptomatology, and 
consider a HIDA scan if there is persistent clinical concern for 
acute cholecystitis.
2. Normal CBD diameter, measuring 5 mm.

ACS consulted and will consider CCY once LFTs normalize this 
admission. 

She then went to ERCP, which showed:
Normal major papilla. 
- Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. 
- The CBD and CHD measured 5mm in diameter. 
- The left and right hepatics and intrahepatics were 
non-dilated. 
- There was a possible filling defect consistent with sludge 
noted in the distal CBD. 
- Otherwise there was no evidence of strictures or stones. 
- The cystic duct and neck of the gallbladder was opacified and 
well visualized.  
- Balloon sweeps were performed of the common bile duct which 
yielded scant sludge. 
- Further sweeps were performed until no debris was noted. 
- Completion occlusion cholangiogram revealed no further filling 
defects.  

Upon arrival to the floor, she is feeling better and has no 
pain.
