INSTRUCTIONS AFTER ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. It is normal 
to feel tired or "washed out" after surgery, and this feeling 
should improve over the first few days to week. 
- Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow 
your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

an over the counter medication.
  2)  Add  oxycodone 2.5 mg every four hours as needed for 
increased pain. Aim to wean off this medication in 1 week or

Take 1 tablet every 4 fours needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days, 
then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every before bedtime as needed x 1 day.  
Then continue with Tylenol for pain.
  3)  Do not stop the Tylenol until you are off of the narcotic 
medication.

narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must
