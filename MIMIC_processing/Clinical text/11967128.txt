History of Present Illness:
___ who is deaf who underwent colonoscopy last week on ___

was performed on a single sessile 1.5cm non bleeding polyp in 
the cecum with placement of 4 clips at site of mucosal defect 
following polypectomy.  The patient returned home and developed 
rectal bleeding yesterday with four bloody stools.  He presented 
to ED where he was hemodynamically stable and not anemic.  GI 
was consulted and recommended for admission with colonoscopy 
planned tomorrow.

The patient reports no other health changes and 10pt ROS 
negative except for mild LLQ discomfort.  He denies fever or 
cough.  He has mild LLQ discomfort that is not severe and does 
not radiate and started post procedure.  

On arrival to the floor he had a bloody bowel movement that was 
dark maroon without fresh blood.  

A single sessile 1.5 cm non-bleeding polyp was found in the 
cecum. A previously inked tattoo was found in proximity to the 
cecal polyp.  ___ mucosal resection was performed. The 
polyp was raised by submucosal injection with saline and 
methylene blue to create a saline pillow. An endoscopic mucosal 
resection (EMR) was performed and the polyp was completely 
removed in piecemeal fashion using a hot snare. The mucosal 
defect at the EMR site was closed with placement of 4 clips.
