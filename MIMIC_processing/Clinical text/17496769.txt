Imaging:

___: CT ABD&PELVIS:
1.  Small bowel obstruction, transition at the small bowel 
anastomosis in the
lower abdomen.
 
2.  Several renal cortical hypodensities some of which are too 
small to
characterize and others which are simple cysts.
 
3.  Sigmoid diverticular disease without evidence of 
diverticulitis.

___: ABD x-ray (supine & erect):
Dilated air-filled loops of small bowel, contrast passage 
through the colon
and rectum, and air in the rectum suggest improving partial 
small bowel
obstruction.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male who presented to ___ on 
___ with complaints of nausea and emesis. A CT ABD&Pelvis

management. He was started on IV fluids, made NPO and had an NGT 
placed to low continuous suction for bowel rest.  He was 
transferred to the step-down surgical floor for serial abdominal 
exams and to await return of bowel function. 

The remainder of the ___ hospital course is described by 
systems below:

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization.

CV: The patient was noted to have asymptomatic sinus bradycardia

his primary care provider. He otherwise remained stable from a 
cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression.  Once passing 
flatus NGT was removed, therefore, the diet was advanced 
sequentially to a Regular diet, which was well tolerated. 
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored.

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
