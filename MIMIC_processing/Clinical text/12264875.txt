Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from ___ for concerns of posterior circulation 
stroke
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed man with history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, migraines with vertigo, gout,
anxiety, hypomania with depression, who presents from ___
as a transfer for posterior circulation strokes.

The patient is quite tangential when providing history and is
here unaccompanied. He states that for the past week he has been
experiencing dizziness and gait instability described as "shaky
when I walk or go up stairs", needing to grab on to the railing
in order to prevent falling. He also reports increased fatigue
and low energy, which he also attributes to increased stress
recently. When asked to describe his dizziness, he endorses
retroorbital left eye pain as well as bifrontal and temporal
headache. He denies sensation of room spinning or
lightheadedness, as well as any vision changes. He denies any 
new
dysarthria or changes in speech or language.

Per transfer documentation, he was brought in by his family who
also noted worsening disorientation, forgetfulness, and slurred
speech. When asked, he does endorse that his memory is poorer 
and
he has more difficulty remembering events and people's names in
the past week. He denies any difficulty usually.

While at ___, initially thought was that this could
represent a usual vertiginous migraine, though he states it 
feels
different. Neurology was consulted and recommended imaging with
MRI/MRA, which showed bilateral posterior circulation infarcts
within the cerebellum, left>right, and left occipital lobe, and
vessel imaging showed basilar artery stenosis vs total 
occlusion.
Transfer request to ___ was made and accepted for further 
care.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech. Denies focal weakness, numbness. No bowel
or bladder incontinence or retention.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills. No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

MRI/MRA head ___:
CONCLUSION:  Multiple  late  acute  or  early  subacute  
infarcts
within  the cerebellar  hemispheres,  as  well  as  left 
occipital  lobe.    Other findings  noted  above,  including 
bilateral  parotid  gland  lesions requiring  further  work-up, 
including  sonography.   

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is normal. Lungs 
are clear.  There is no pleural effusion. There is no 
pneumothorax.

CTA Head and Neck ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Evolving acute infarcts in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres 
and left 
occipital pole, as seen on the ___ MRI. No acute 
hemorrhage. 
2. Mild atherosclerosis of bilateral proximal internal carotid 
arteries with approximately 10% stenosis by NASCET criteria on 
the right and no stenosis by NASCET criteria on the left. 
3. Mixed plaque in the cavernous left internal carotid artery 
with mild 
associated stenosis ; comparison to the ___ MRA is 
limited by 
differences in modalities.  Calcified plaque in bilateral 
paraclinoid/ 
supraclinoid internal carotid arteries without significant

abnormalities are new compared to ___.  Absence of acute 
right PCA territory infarction suggests that right PCA occlusion 
is not acute.  Posterior communicating arteries are not

circulation and possibly also external collaterals are 
suspected.

territorial infarction. 
  
2.  Irregularity and high-grade stenosis of the midbasilar 
artery spanning 
approximately 5 mm, occlusion of the right posterior cerebral 
artery, and 
irregularity of the P1 segment of the left cerebral artery are 
grossly 
unchanged compared to prior examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was transferred from OS___ on ___ in the setting of 
severe intracranial posterior circulation atherosclerotic 
disease and bilateral cerebellar infarcts and left occipital 
infarct.

He was admitted and monitored.  Repeat CTA confirmed significant 
intracranial atherosclerosis  (basilar artery stenosis, 
bilateral PCA stenosis, stenosis of left ICA at the cavernous 
portion).  This was a notable change from prior MRA imaging ___ 
years ago.  As part of stroke evaluation, Transthoracic echo was 
performed on ___ and showed LVEF 70% with no signs of 
thrombus.

On ___, he had an abrupt change in speech, flattening of 
right nasolabial ridge and left sided weakness concerning for 
new infarct, thus a STAT Head CT and CTA head/neck was 
completed.  Repeat imaging did not show any new infarcts.  Due 
to concerns of stable atherosclerosis, he was started on Dual 
antiplatelet therapy (Plavix in addition to aspirin), with plans 
for 3 months of DAPT.  Following this he will likely transition 
to single agent.  MRI Brain did not show any signs evidence of 
inflammatory changes or contrast enhancement.

Mr. ___ continued to do well on dual anti-platelet therapy 
with no further events.  His activity was liberated and was 
cleared for discharge to rehab.

***Dual antiplatelet therapy of Aspirin and Plavix is to be for 
3months only ___

Transitions of Care: 
1. Please continue to take aspirina nd plavix for 3 months. 
2. Please follow up with the stroke neurology physician on 
___. 
3. Please Follow up with the cholesterol specialist on ___
4. Given recent ischemic infarct, please allow for permissive 
hypertension for the next ___ days to 180 systolic.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of unsteadiness and 
slurred speech resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
Elevated triglycerides 360, Elevated LDL 141
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
Begin Plavix 75mg daily and Aspirin 81mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Followup Instructions:
