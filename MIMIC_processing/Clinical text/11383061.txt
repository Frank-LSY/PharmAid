History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a pleasant ___ with hx IVDU, ?endocarditis, who 
presents w/ complaints of CP and fever. Pt states that he has 
been feeling diaphoretic and febrile for the past couple of 
days.  He became anxious and concerned that this may be due to 
recurrent endocarditis, and due to this unfortunately relapsed 
with heroin 2 days ago after a reported 6 months period of 
sobriety.  He presented to the ED at ___ earlier today with CP 
and fever, however left as he was discouraged by the long wait.  
He was later questioned by the police at ___, taken into 
custody because of a probation warrant.  While under police 
custody, he reported CP and was therefore brought to the ED.  He 
also reports significant malaise, fatigue, fevers w/ tmax 102.  
He reports swelling and pain at injection site of medial L 
elbow, no drainage.  His history of endocarditis is a little 
unclear; he states that he was told he had endocarditis during 
and admission to ___ last ___, however left (? AMA) 
without treatment.  Since that admission, he did not pursue 
further treatment as he states he was feeling fine, and he has 
been followed by his PCP during that time as well who, per 
patient, was not concerned for endocarditis.   

In the ED, initial vitals were: 10 97.6 106 111/60 22 98% RA.  
Pain had improved to 5 at the time of transfer. Pt was given 
vancomycin, Zofran for nausea and 1L NS.  Blood cultures were 
drawn.  

Currently, he states his chest pain has improved and is nearly 
gone.  Describes it as substernal but radiating throughout the 
chest and abdomen, fairly constant, different from prior CP 
associated with anxiety.  He had SOB earlier, however this has 
resolved.  Also endorsed dizziness and double vision earlier, 
however this has since resolved and he notes he has been having 
trouble eating and sleeping due to worry over endocarditis, and 
he believes that this may be contributing.  Also had N/V earlier 
however improved with Zofran, had diarrhea previously but none 
recently.  No joint pain except for at L elbow at injection 
site.  Does not feel like he is withdrawing currently.
