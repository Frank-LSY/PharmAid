Discharge Instructions:
You may see blood in your urine. This is common right after

you can't see through it, contact your doctor. 
These steps can help you recover after your procedure. 
Drink plenty of water to flush out the bladder. 
Avoid straining during a bowel movement. Eat fiber-containing 
foods and avoid foods that can cause constipation. Ask your 
doctor if you should take a laxative if you do become 
constipated. 
Don't do any strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 
four to six weeks or until your doctor says it's OK. 
Don't have sex. You'll likely be able to resume sexual 
activity in about four to six weeks. 
Don't drive until your doctor says it's OK. ___, you can 
drive once your catheter is removed and you're no longer taking 
prescription pain medications. 
 
You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You 
should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.  

Should you HOLD ASPIRIN? Unless otherwise advised;  If the urine 
is still pink, hold the aspirin until it has been clear/yellow 
for at least three days. 

-You may be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM 
that will help with the "burning" pain you may experience when 
voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.
