___ is a ___ man with a past medical 
history significant for R leg dvt now improved and complex 
regional pain syndrome, hypertension, and concussion s/p MVA 
last ___ subsequently found to have a L vert dissection on 
imaging done in ___ (presumably done at ___, 
patient does not remember). He presents today as a transfer from 
___ after developing acute onset ataxia, vertigo 
when he woke up at 2:30 AM today. 

Briefly, the patient was in a car accident last ___. He 
subsequently developed headaches and neck pain. After the 
headaches were worsening he underwent a CTA head and neck in 
___ (patient thinks it was at ___) where a L vert. 
dissection was found. The patient was then referred to see a 
"stroke neurologist" at ___ but his appointments kept 
getting cancelled and so he had not yet seen anyone. He was not 
put on aspirin. 

Yesterday the patient was feeling well and went to sleep at 
10pm. He woke up at around ___ AM feeling dehydrated and like 
he had to use the bathroom. When he opened his eyes he noted 
that the whole house was spinning around him. He tried to sit up 
and get out of bed but he was falling over. It took him a very 
long time to become steady on his feet. He needed his wife's 
help to walk to the bathroom. This morning he was still 
constantly symptomatic and started to vomit x3. Due to these 
symptoms EMS was called and he was brought to ___ 
___. 

At ___ concern was for acute stroke, he 
underwent CT head and CTA head and neck. CTA head and neck 
revealed occlusion of the L vert from the origin up until V4 
with only trace flow. No clear infarct seen on CT head. He was 
subsequently transferred to ___ and code stroke was activated. 


At ___, repeat head imaging obtained and showed same findings 
on CTA head and neck, no clear infarct on CT head though 
possibly more hypodensity in L cerebellum though not very clear. 


Patient states he is not taking any antiplatelets. He has never 
had vertigo or neurologic symptoms prior to onset early this AM.

DIAGNOSTICS:
==============
___ TTE:
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
55-60%. Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 
L/min/m2). 
IMPRESSION: 
1) No evidence for right-to-left intracardiac shunt at rest or 
with maneuvers. 
2) Mild RV dilation in setting of normal RV function and 
afterload.

MEASUREMENTS:
LEFT ATRIUM ___ ATRIUM (RA)
___: 3.9cm (nl<=4.0)
___ 4Chamber Length: 4.4cm (nl<5.2)
___ Volume: 56mL
___ Volume Index: 27mL/mÂ² (nl <35)

___ MRI/A brain
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Acute small infarction on the left pontomedullary junction 
measuring 
approximately 2.5 x 2.5 mm in transverse dimension (series 302, 
image 6). 
2.  Complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery, better 
depicted on the same date CTA.  
3.  Patent major vascular intracranial structures, with no 
evidence of flow stenotic lesions or aneurysms. 
4.  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or 
mass effect.

CTA H/N:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities on noncontrast head CT. 
2. No evidence of abnormal brain perfusion. 
3. Complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery throughout 
the majority of its course due to the patient's known 
dissection.  There is reconstitution of the distal left cervical 
vertebral artery with trickle flow, however the V4 segment is 
not visualized.  Overall, this is unchanged compared to the CTA 
with the same date. 
4. No other evidence of large vessel occlusion, stenosis, 
aneurysm, or 
dissection.  No internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET 
criteria. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH HTN, MVC last year with known L vert dissection (found 
on imaging in ___ in setting of headaches), who 
developed acute onset vertigo, L face numbness, and ataxia who 
was found to have an acute left inferior cerebellar peduncle 
infarct.

#Left inferior cerebellar peduncle infarct
Patient has a known left vertebral artery dissection with repeat 
CTA here showing minimal to no flow through the V1, V2 and V4 
segments, most likely due to MVA in ___. Exam is notable for 
nystagmus in multiple directions, and dysmetria more prominent 
on the L, he also has decreased sensation to light touch in the 
L hemibody. Risk factor labs show HbA1c 5.9, LDL 144. He was 
started on ASA 325mg daily and atorvastatin 80mg daily.
-neuro checks q4h
-allow BP to autoregulate
- will complement workup with Ziopatch as outpatient

#HTN
Allow SBP to autoregulate but goal <180. Hold home lisinopril. 
Halve home metoprolol.  
- Hydralazine 10 mg IV q6h prn SBP > 180

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness, face 
numbness and vomiting resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 High blood pressure
 High cholesterol  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
 START aspirin
 START atorvastatin 
 TAKE ___ for 3 weeks (Stop ___
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

You may return to work after 2 weeks. If you have any concerns 
or ongoing symptoms, please see your PCP, who will then 
determine if you need to be seen by us before your scheduled 
appointment.

STOP ___ ___

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
