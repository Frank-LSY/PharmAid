HISTORY OF THE PRESENTING ILLNESS:
==================================
The patient is a ___ year old right handed male with 
hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, CKD, trigeminal neuralgia, and 
longstanding
cervical myelopathy recently evaluated by Dr. ___ was
referred to the ED for admission to the Stroke Service after
recent MRI showed foci of increased DWI signal intensity in the
right parieto-occipital region concerning for subacute
infarctions.

Mr. ___ presented to neurology clinic on ___ with
the chief complaint of trigeminal neuralgia, a problem that
started back in ___. He has tried gabapentin in the past with
unclear benefit. His symptoms come and go every few years. He
states that he is currently feeling a "different type of pain" 
in
the left eye area (same location as his left-sided trigeminal
neuralgia) which he describes as similar to the neuropathy he
feels in his legs. 

On exam, he was noted to have left leg weakness with diffuse,
though left > right, hyper-reflexia. There was sustained clonus
in both ankles. He was also found to have an irregular heart 
beat
with a ___ murmur at the RUSB.

MRI brain was recommended to evaluate for a vascular loop that
may explain his trigeminal neuralgia symptoms. MRI of the head
without contrast was performed on ___ and showed a small
vascular loop in close relation and minimally abutting the root
entry zone of the right trigeminal nerve but without mass effect
as well as "questionable foci of increased DWI signal intensity
in right parieto-occipital region which could represent late
subacute infarcts."

As such, the patient was referred to the ED for admission to the
stroke service for expedited workup.

Of note, patient was previously followed at ___ Neurology by
Dr. ___. He was last seen there in ___. MRI
brain from ___ (most recent brain MRI prior to the study
from ___ showed nonspecific white matter foci, likely
related to small vessel ischemic disease. In terms of his
cervical myelopathy, Dr. ___ the possibility that 
this
was demyelinating (? transverse myelitis) though he felt that 
the
slow progression argued against this. MRI of the cervical spine
from ___ (compared to prior from ___ showed
"unchanged foci of cord signal abnormality at C3 in the midline
and at T1 anteriorly on the left. These are unchanged compared
with ___ without evidence of enhancement or cord expansion. Per
radiology read, "these likely reflect a manifestation of gliosis
from prior myelitis or demyelination." The patient has never 
been
on disease modifying therapy.
  
On neurological ROS, the patient denies headache, loss of 
vision,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the patient denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Transitional Issues
=====================
[ ] F/u Ziopatch results, if consistent w/ atrial fibrillation, 
the patient should be started on apixaban (5mg BID as does not 
meet age or weight requirements for dose reduction)
[ ] Pt provided outpatient physical therapy prescription for his 
cervical myelopathy symptoms
[ ] Pt noted to have A1c of 5.8 c/w prediabetes

Pt presented as referral for likely subacute infarcts noted 
incidentally on MRI imaging (obtained in evaluation of 
trigeminal neuralgia). Pt has no symptoms, and his physical exam 
is only notable for evidence of his known cervical myelopathy. 
He had an MRA w/o contrast (given CKD) which did not show a 
large burden of atherosclerotic disease. He additionally had an 
echocardiogram which did not show any acute causes of stroke. He 
was discharged w/ a Ziopatch. LDL noted to be 78, A1c5.8

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were incidentally noticed to have had a few small strokes 
while undergoing workup for your trigeminal neuralgia. We don't 
this is causing you any symptoms currently, but we will want to 
do our best to prevent further strokes in the future. 

You had an echocardiogram this admission to look for a cause of 
your strokes, this was normal. You were discharged with a 
Ziopatch to monitor for an abnormal rhythm. 

We did not change any medications. Your risk factors include 
high blood pressure and high cholesterol which are both fairly 
well controlled at this time.
