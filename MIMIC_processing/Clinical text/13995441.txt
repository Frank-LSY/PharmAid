#Orthostatic syncope:
Syncope was likely orthostatic syncope precipitated in the 
context of alcohol usage and marijuana use. She received 3L NS 
in the ED but remained tachycardic. EKG on admission showed 
nonspecific half mm ST depressions in V5-V6 but troponins were 
negative. CTA performed in the emergency room was negative for 
PE or any other notable pathology. On careful cardiac exam she 
was noted to not have any murmur to suggest AS or HoCM. Neuro 
exam was unremarkable. She was noted noted to have any abnormal 
rhythms while monitored overnight on telemetry.

On the morning of hospital day one, her tachycardia was 
improved, but she was noted to have borderline orthostatic 
hypotension with drop in SBP from 118 -> 102 and was given 
another liter of IVF.  She appears to have been quite 
dehydrated, given that she was still borderline orthostatic even 
after getting a couple liters of fluid in the ED. Marijuana 
intoxication is known to cause tachycardia independent of 
hydration status, so I suspect this was the missing variable 
that initially made her tachycardia appear to not be completely 
fluid responsive. 

In the setting of a normal Neurological exam, negative HINTS 
exam and her improvement over the course of the night with no 
events on telemetry, there was low concern for serious cardiac 
or neurologic cause; patient was encouraged to stay hydrated and 
is asked to follow up with her PCP.
