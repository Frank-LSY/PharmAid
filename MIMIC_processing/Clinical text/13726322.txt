History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with hyperlipidemia 
presenting
from ___ with 2 days of slurred speech and left sided
weakness. 

Yesterday, he was with a friend (who is a physician) who noted
that he appeared to have left sided facial droop and slurred
speech.  He did not notice it himself, and says that he mumbles
at baseline.  Today he was in a store with the same friend who
mentioned that he appeared to be dragging his left leg.  He did
notice this and said that his leg felt like it was heavy, and
there was a subtle paresthesia in his left leg that was "not
quite pins and needles". He denies feeling weakness in his left
arm at the time, though when questioned says he feels like he
probably would not be able to lift something heavy with both
arms. 

He presented to ___ where CTA was performed did not show
any large vessel occlusions.  Noncontrast CT showed a small
likely colloidial cyst at the foramen of ___. 

He notes a new intermittent headache for the last few weeks,
occurring on ___ days out of the week that his alternatively
bifrontal or occipital in location, ___ dull intensity, and
not associated with any migrainous symptoms.  He sometimes wakes
up with the headache, but other times it starts spontaneously
during the day.  It usually resolves after a few hours and with
Tylenol or aspirin.  It does not worsen with position or
Valsalva.

He has a history of hyperlipidemia. He was on atorvastatin but
stopped taking it ___ years ago due to muscle pains.  He does not
visit the doctor often, but says his blood pressure has always
been excellent. 

He notes increasing clumsiness over the last several years, 
which
he has attributed to getting older.  He did fall in ___ of last
year, and while landing on his left hand he fractured his left
elbow.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old many with hyperlipidemia who 
presented with left leg weakness and dysarthria who was admitted 
to the Neurology stroke service. Fortunately, his symptoms 
improved and by the time that he was examined on rounds, he had 
returned to his baseline. Thus, this is most likely a TIA 
secondary to vascular risk factors. He does have significant 
vascular risk factors and received detailed education about his 
risk factors and what the appropriate treatment for each of his 
risk factors is. His LDL was significantly elevated to 173. We 
started ___ 10 mg for this, considering that he had 
previously proximal muscle pain when he was on a low dose of 
Atorvastatin .  HbA1c 6.3. TSH slightly elevated at 7.4, T3 and 
free T4 were normal. Emphasized the importance of healthy diet, 
daily exercise, preventative health care and routine primary 
care follow up. 

His stroke risk factors include the following: 
 1) DM: A1c 6.3% 
 2) Hyperlipidemia: LDL 173, ___ started
 3) Obesity BMI 32.5
 4) Snoring with suspected sleep apnea

Transitional issues: 
[ ] Hg A1c 6.3%
[ ] PCP to ___ as tolerated, goal LDL <70
[ ] no follow up is needed for incidentally found colloid cyst 
seen on MR brain
[ ] needs sleep study to evaluate for sleep apnea

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr. ___,
  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left leg weakness 
resulting from a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, oxygen and nutrients 
temporarily do not get to the brain because the vessel is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 High cholesterol
 snoring with concern for sleep apnea
 Obesity
 Pre-diabetes
 Poor diet with low fiber, high simple sugar intake
 Lack of exercise
 
 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 Start ___ 10 mg nightly
 Start Fish Oil 1000 mg BID

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with your primary care physician as listed 
below.  

 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  

 Your ___ Neurology Team
