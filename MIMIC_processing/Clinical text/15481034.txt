Transesophageal echocardiogram ___

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a ___ with no PMH here with speech
difficulty, R facial droop and mild R arm weakness and gait
instability (drifting to the R) starting this AM. 

Last known well was 10pm on ___ per his wife. Pt reports 
that
he drank more than he usually did last night - 1 beer and 7
drinks of a "liquor" he cannot produce the name of. He also
reports that he had ground level fall last night causing some
right hip/back pain today. Denies any head stroke or loss of
consciousness. 

Pt took his son to school this AM and when he returned at around
10AM, his wife noted that there was something off about his
speech though it is unclear what this actually was. He was not
feeling well and wanted to go to sleep. He thought that he was
feeling unwell from drinking so much the night before. 

When he awoke at 12PM, he clearly had a right facial droop and
had difficulty with his speech. He reports that while he knew
what he wanted to say, he was either having difficulty getting
the words out or when they did come out, they would come out in
the wrong language - ___ instead of ___. She also noted
right arm weakness in that he could not lift one of their
children as well as a mildly unsteady gait when walking. 

At ___ he was out of the window for TPA. NCHCT was
performed showing L basal ganglia hypodensity. CTA H and N 
showed
no large vessel occlusion or dissection. He was transferred for
further management/imaging. 

On evaluation in BI ED, his speech is fluent and he reports it 
is
much improved from prior. He dose still seem to have some
difficulty with word finding. He does not think he is weak
anymore.  

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache,
lightheadedness, or confusion. Denies loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies focal muscle
weakness, numbness, parasthesia. Denies loss of sensation. 
Denies
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal
pain.  No dysuria.

speech difficulty, R facial droop and mild R arm, weakness and 
gait instability (drifting to the R).  Last known well 10PM 
___. Neurologic exam in the ED was significant for slowed

slowed RAM and orbiting with R arm, sensation of drifting to 
right with walking and inability to tandem.  He was admitted to 
strok neurology by neurology attending ___, MD.  MRI 
showed large infarct in the globus pallidus, interal capsule, 
putamen region with slight involvement of the head of the 
caudate. TEE found small PFO. LENIS and MRI pelvis showed no 
evidence of venous thrombosis. Hypercoaguability work-up pending 
for beta-2-microglobulin, antithrombin, cardiolipin, lupus, 
protein-S and protein-C.  
On admission he was started on ASA 81mg daily. Before discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of speech difficulties, 
right facial droop, right arm weakness, and gait instability 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
Patent foramen ovale

We are changing your medications as follows:  
1. Please start taking Aspirin 81 mg daily
2. Please start taking Atorvastatin 40mg daily 
  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  Please email Dr. ___ (email provided 
on business card) to have a sooner appointment. 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
