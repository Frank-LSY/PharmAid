colonoscopy and clip placement at bleeding site with hemostasis. 
 He was maintained on a clear liquid diet during his hospital

throughout his hospital stay.  His case was extensively 
discussed with the gastroenterology team who felt that he was 
stable for discharge on ___ with repeat CBC within 1 week 
and follow-up with PCP and gastroenterology.

Given report of feeling clammy and bradycardic, etiology of the 
syncopal episode likely in the setting of anemia and possibly a 
vagal episode.  His  initial EKG did show evidence of slight STE 
on V1 and I which was resolved on subsequent EKG.
