# Syncope. Hx of lightheadedness/diaphoresis/nausea prior to 
syncope c/w vasovagal episode especially given similar episode 
years prior. Less likely ___ pulmonary emboli, orthostasis, 
neurogenic or cardiogenic causes. No events noted on telemetry

presentation. Of note, despite recent plane flight whether  or 
not these clots were provoked is uncertain. No family or

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to be part of your care at ___.

You were admitted to the hospital because you passed out while 
at work. 

During your hospitalization you were found to have several blood 
clots in your lungs. You will need to take blood thinning 
medications for several months to prevent further blood clots.

It is possible that you passed out because you had clots in your 
lung however it is more likely that you passed out due to what 
is called a "vasovagal" reaction, which is common and can occur 
when you are dehydrated or overheated. 

In the future if you start feeling similarly lightheaded, sweaty 
or nauseous then please sit down immediately and drink plenty of 
water in addition to eating a snack. 

You should follow up with your primary care doctor to monitor 
your blood pressure and the new blood thinning medication. 

You should take 10 mg apixiban/eliquis (the blood thinner) twice 
a day for 7 days and then switch to 5 mg twice a day for ___ 
months.

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Team
