Pertinent Results:
___ 10:28AM   WBC-5.3 RBC-5.50* HGB-16.1* HCT-50.9* MCV-93 
MCH-29.3 MCHC-31.6* RDW-13.0 RDWSD-44.___fter the patient came to the floor, she had no further episodes 
of vomiting or diarrhea. She slept well overnight and by next 
morning she felt well. Was able eat both breakfast and lunch 
without issue. Her VS remained stable and she was discharged in 
good condition.

We attributed this to a viral gastreoenteritis that led to 
inability to take hydrocortisone and adrenal crisis. We 
discussed follow-up with her endocrinologist to discuss what she 
might do in another situation given this is the second time this 
has happened within the year.
