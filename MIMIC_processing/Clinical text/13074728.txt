IMAGING
========
CTA CHEST ___
HEART AND VASCULATURE: Slightly motion limited exam, 
particularly at the lung
bases.  Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified to the 
subsegmental level without filling defect to indicate a 
pulmonary embolus.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber 
without evidence of dissection or intramural hematoma.  The 
heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within normal limits. 
No pericardial effusion is seen. 
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: No axillary, mediastinal, or 
hilar lymphadenopathy is present.  No mediastinal mass.
PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: There is severe upper lobe predominant 
centrilobular emphysema. Lungs are clear without areas of 
parenchymal opacification except for mild linear atelectasis in 
the right middle lobe and lingula.  The airways are patent to 
the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There is mild 
diffuse bronchial wall thickening.
BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no abnormality.
ABDOMEN:  Included portion of the upper abdomen is notable only 
for a small
hiatal hernia.
BONES: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no 
acute fracture.
Gynecomastia is noted.

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal left 
ventricular wall thickness with a moderately increased/dilated 
cavity. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection 
fraction is 65%. The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. Normal right ventricular cavity size with low 
normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus is mildly dilated with 
mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. Hypertrophic right ventricle with borderline 
systolic function.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of tobacco use and 
no other known past medical history, who presented with severe 
dyspnea and found to have severe emphysema.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Dyspnea
# Severe emphysema
# Suspected COPD exacerbation
Presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea, 
worsening to the point that he could not walk less than 20 feet 
without stopping to rest. No medical care since the ___. 40+ 
pack year smoking history. Alpha-1 anti-trypsin sent, results 
still pending at time of discharge. TTE obtained with normal EF 
and valvular function but evidence of pulmonary hypertension, 
likely secondary to pulmonary disease. Treated with 5 day course 
of prednisone and azithromycin for suspected COPD exacerbation. 
Started on duonebs and O2, then on ___ steroids. 
Intermittently desatting to mid-80s at night on room air and 
consistently desatting with activity, improved with ___ L O2. 
Discussed with pulmonary who recommended evaluation for VATS v. 
Transplant after demonstration of ability to follow-up. Given 
Gold Class B COPD, stopped inhaled steroid. Wanted to discharge 
on ___ combo such as Anora Elipta, but could not obtain 
due to cost an insurance status. Discharged on Tiotropium and 
Albuterol scheduled (as a replacement for unavailable ___. Set 
up home O2 to be delivered to home the evening of discharge. 
After speaking with manager at ___, they stated they 
have a pharmacy on-site and would be able to help with future 
medication needs.

# Rash on back and chest
# Concern for tinea versicolor
Large, well-demarcated, erythematous patch on back with some 
scaling and smaller, well-demarcated, more erythematous patch on 
the anterior chest suggestive of tinea versicolor. Patient 
reports intermittent pruritis. Treated with topical terbinafine 
while inpatient, then switched to clotrimazole to complete ___epressed Mood
# Coping
History of several years of not leaving home, concerning for 
depressed mood. Unclear if concomitant mood disorder present or 
related to symptoms and limitations from primary COPD. Has 
reported improving mood over the course of hospitalization with 
improvement of respiratory symptoms. Should continue to follow 
as outpatient.

# Poor Nutrition
Reports poor nutritional intake for some time due to lack of 
interest. Reportedly has increased PO intake since quitting 
smoking. Slight macrocytosis noted, however B12 and folate WNL. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended liberalizing diet.

# Respiratory acidosis
VBG ___ with pH 7.26 and pCO2 73, bicarb 28 vs VBG ___ with pH 
7.36, pCO2 47, bicarb 23. Likely due to O2 administration 
worsening ventilation - perfusion mismatch. Improved with 
weaning O2.

# No insurance, poor access to medical care
On initial presentation, the patient was without medical 
insurance. With the help of case management and social work, 
arranged for free home-going prescriptions through Free Care and 
home oxygen through ___. At the time of discharge, the 
patient was set up with a new PCP, with plans for close follow 
up in pulmonary and ___ clinic.

RESOLVED ISSUES
===============
# Lactic Acidosis
Lactate initially elevated to 5.7, improved to 3.2 in the ED 
after 2L NS. Further improved to 1.6 on ___. No hypotension, 
although significantly tachycardic on arrival. Some component of 
lactate could be related to dehydration/hypovolemia, exacerbated 
by albuterol treatments. Not at all septic appearing on arrival 
to the floor. Improved to normal by the next morning.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] No previous contact with medical system since 1990s. 
Established with PCP at ___ on discharge; ___ will call to 
schedule.

Class B COPD stopped inhaled steroid. Wanted to discharge on 
___ such as Anora Elipta as well as Albuterol prn. However 
could not get ___ covered through free care pharmacy either as 
combination or solo inhalers, so discharged only on LAMA 
(tiotropium) and ___ (albuterol) scheduled pending availability 
of ___. Likely would benefit from addition ___ when 
insurance has been processed. At that point, can make albuterol 
prn.
[ ] ___ to deliver home O2 evening of discharge.
[ ] Once established with PCP, should be referred to pulmonary 
for PFT and further care of advanced emphysema.
[ ] Insurance in process with Health Safety Net. ID number

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

What you should do when you leave the hospital:
- We have set you up to see a new primary care doctor. Please 
try to keep that appointment.
- You should be referred to a lung specialist.
- Continue the inhalers that we have prescribed for you.
