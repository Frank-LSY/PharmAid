CT head: 

Final Addendum 
ADDENDUM  The finding of prominent superior ophthalmic veins was 
discussed by telephone by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 12:22 on 
___. 
    

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # ___   
Reason: ?bleed or elevated ICP before lp  
  Final Report 
EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD 
INDICATION:  ___ with four days fever, n/v, headache, evaluate 
for bleed or elevated ICP before lumbar puncture appear 
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the brain were obtained 
without 
contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations as well as bone 
algorithm 
reconstructions were provided and reviewed. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  
The 
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  The visualized portion of the 
paranasal 
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  
There is mild bilateral prominence of the superior ophthalmic 
veins.  This is not definitely outside therange of normal, but 
can be associated with a carotid cavernous fistula.  Otherwise, 
the visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Prominent bilateral superior ophthalmic veins.  Although this 
may be within range of normal, the finding raises the 
possibility of a carotid cavernous fistula. 
Otherwise normal study.

CMV and EBV IgG positive
acetaminophen negative
Anaplasma Igm/igG negative
Anaplasma DNA pending
Lyme test - sent for Western Blot
Babesia pending
HIV negative
Cortisol am ___ with hx of depression presenting with 6 day history of fever 
and chills, likely reflecting viral or tickborne process.

# Fever: High fevers to 104.9 on multiple occasions, with 
associated mild pancytopenia and modestly elevated LFTs. 
Localizing findings are only her area of slight erythema at base 
of R hallux and her RUQ tenderness, which likely is an effect, 
rather than cause, of relatively mild hepatitis. She denies 
travel, although is at risk for tick exposure, as review of 
At___ records is notable for multiple tick bites in the past. 
She has no sick contacts, and is low risk for HIV based on her 
history. 
She was seen by the infectious disease service who felt it was 
likely that her symptoms represented a tick borne illness, 
perhaps a lyme/anaplasma ___ and advised doxycycline 
100 mg po bid.  She had daily clinical improvement while she was 
here - her sweats improved, energy levels improved.   Lyme test 
has been sent for Western Blot and Awaiting anaplasma DNA.  She 
was given a prescription of doxycycline to finish up a 3 week 
course.  Our infectious disease service will followup on the 
results of pending labs.  

# Pancytopenia - mild, completely resolved after starting 
doxycycline.  

# Elevated LFTs:  Continued to rise during her hospitalization.  
Transaminitis.  NO elevation in T bili, which argues against 
shock liver.  Suspect that this hepatitis is from her tick borne 
disease (discussed with ID and informally with hepatology).  
Recommend that her LFTs be rechecked ___ days after discharge.  
She has no risk factors for acute viral hepatitis and denies any 
use of herbal medications.  She had heavy Tylenol use for about 
2 days, but acetaminophen level when checked in the hospital was 
negative.  

# Low blood pressures:  Noted to be hypotensive to 70/30s (per 
patient report) while at ___, and while in the 
hospital, ran pressures in the ___, which remains 
slightly below her baseline.  She denied dizziness.  She was 
given IVF and pressures did not seem to increase.  Labs did show 
volume depletion.  Cortisol level was above 10, inconsistent 
with adrenal insufficiency.  Expect this to improve with ongoing 
treatment of suspected tick borne illness  

# Prominent bilateral superior ophthalmic veins, potentially 
normal but can be seen in the setting of carotid cavernous 
fistula: Initially read by Dr. ___, who is neuroradiology 
attending.  Pt's superior ophthalmic veins are larger than "most 
people's." Carotid cavernous fistula may occur as result of AV 
malformation dural fistula or from spontaneous rupture. Pt 
denies history of trauma. Per Dr. ___ further imaging 
recommended at this time.  Per Dr. ___, as long as she is 
asymptomatic, no indication for further imaging - no reason to 
intervene even if she does have asymptomatic CC fistula - 
although as a radiologist he explains that it would reasonable 
to review this with an ophthalmologist or neurologist at some 
point.   She has no proptosis on exam and her extraocular 
movements are intact.  No bruit over the ophthalmic vessels.  
Discussed with her and her PCP - they can consider outpatient 
neurology evaluation.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with very high fevers, 
headaches and feeling unwell.  You had a lumbar puncture that 
was unremarkable.  You also had a CT scan that showed a likely 
enlargement of the ophthalmic veins; we discussed this finding 
and agreed that you would followup with an ___ neurologist.

You were evaluated by the infectious diseases team and it is 
felt that your symptoms are likely from a tick borne illness, 
and you were started on the antibiotic doxycycline, and your 
symptoms have improved dramatically.  We have given you a 
prescription for an additional 18 days of doxycycline and this 
will complete a 3 week course.  I have also given you a limited 
supply of the medication fiorinal, which we have discussed is a 
good short term treatment for your headaches.
Continue to stay well hydrated and continue to attempt to eat 
well.  Increase your activity as tolerated.  

We suspect that the elevation in your Liver function tests are 
also from your underlying illness.  Please call Dr ___ 
office on ___ to discuss getting them rechecked.
