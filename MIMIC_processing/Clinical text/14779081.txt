DETAILS BY PROBLEMS
   
# Acute blood loss anemia
# Acute upper GI bleed
# Gastric ulcer
# Thalassemia 
-Patient with at least 2 episodes of hematemsis with associated 
drop in Hb. EGD performed which revealed small antral ulcer with 
possible pigmented spot. This was treated with BiCAP with good 
hemostasis, and no residual oozing. GI recommend overnight 
observation ensure hemodynamic stability. I discussed the 
possibility of a blood transfusion with the patient who declined 
at this time due to fatigue, and lateness or the hour. I 
consented her for blood in the meantime and she would consider 
transfusion tomorrow if Hb <7.
-She did not pass any stool, so stool H pylori was not sent, 
this could be considered in the outpatient setting
Â–He was started on pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily, and should 
continue this for at least 8 weeks
-Gastroenterology recommended repeat endoscopy in ___ weeks for 
documentation of ulcer
healing, GI indicated they would arrange this, the patient was 
provided with the clinic phone number if there are any issues
-Patient was counseled to avoid NSAIDs at least until healing is 
documented, and also told to hold off on her aspirin until 
further discussion with her PCP, and cardiologist
    
#Incidentally discovered coronary artery disease
-Hold Aspirin for now, see details above
-Continue statin
  
#Multiple sclerosis 
Chronic, stable

Discharge Diagnosis:

#Coronary artery atherosclerosis, no history of ischemia

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to an 
antral ulcer (an ulcer in your stomach near where it transitions 
into the first part of the small intestine, known as the 
duodenum).  You underwent an upper endoscopy (camera down the 
throat) during which the Gastroenterologists applied "bicap" (a 
form of cautery) to scar the ulcer so it wouldn't bleed again.  
Afterwards your blood counts were low (anemia) but stable and 
you did not require a transfusion.  You tolerated a regular diet 
before discharge.

We recommend you avoid all NSAIDs (non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory) medications, such as Advil, Aleve, ibuprofen, 
Motrin, and aspirin.  Regarding your aspirin, please do not take 
it until further discussion with your primary care physician and 
cardiologist.

We recommend you take an acid-reducing medication (pantoprazole) 
as we've prescribed.  It should be high dose, twice a day for at 
least 2 months.  After that discuss whether you can taper it 
with Gastroenterology.

We recommend you follow-up with Gastroenterology for repeat 
endoscopy as noted below.
