Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with a history of HTN, HLD, CAD,
prostate cancer s/p XRT w/ recurrent disease on leuprolide, GIST
s/p partial gastrectomy (___), pre-diabetes, CKD who presented
with atypical chest pain and underwent a chest CTA notable for 
left sided PNA with small pleural effusion. He tolerated 
antibiotic regimen and was able to be discharged the day after 
admission.

# Acute LLL bacterial PNA:
Although without leukocytosis or cough, patient presented with 
fevers as well as radiographic evidence of left lower lobe PNA 
on CTA with small parapneumonic effusion. Patient was initiated 
on ceftriaxone/azithromycin on night of admission and was able 
to be transitioned to Cefpodoxime/azithromycin without issue. He 
was afebrile on the floor and able to be discharged to complete 
5 day course. Patient pleural effusion did not impair patient 
respiratory status or require any intervention during the course 
of his admission. 

# Atypical Chest Pain:
Presented with two days of non-exertional somewhat reproducible 
chest pain, atypical for cardiac ischemia. His presentation was 
notable for new TWI in leads II, III however his cardiac enzymes 
were negative x2. Patient EKG exonerated pericarditis and CTA 
exonerated PE. No sign of volume overload on exam. Pain most 
likely multifactorial in setting of musculoskeletal component 
(reproducible on palpation) as well as at site of PNA/effusion. 
However, given patient multiple cardiac risk factors, he would 
likely benefit from stress test as an outpatient. Of note, 
however, patient is already on aspirin, beta blocker, and 
statin. 

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:
======================

# Hypertension 
SBP consistently greater than 180 on home atenolol and 
amlodipine. Atenolol dose was increased prior to discharge. 
# CKD
Cr 1.3, baseline 1.1-1.2. 

# Pre-diabetes
A1c 6.3 in ___

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[ ] New Medications: Cefpoxodime, azithromycin
[ ] Changed Medications: Atenolol 50 to 75
[ ] Held Medications: None

[ ] Consider outpatient stress vs ischemic cardiac work up in 
setting of risk factors and uncertain etiology of chest pain
[ ] Continue to titrate patient's anti hypertensive regimen. 
consider increasing amlodipine
[ ] Consider transition to more cardioprotective beta blocker
