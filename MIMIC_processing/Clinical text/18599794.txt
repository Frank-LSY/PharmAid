difficulties in his life and had a desire to "punish" himself, 
or "at least hurt" himself for perceived academic difficulties 
in college. He stated that he had a desire to live and did not 
want to die. Following the attempt, he emailed his therapist and 
reached out to 2 of his close friends. 
.

verbal and physical ("pushing", "not punching") altercation with 
his close friends, that left him with intense negative feelings 
and "impulsivity". He has been dealing with depression for ___ 
years, at times severe, and also deals with intense anxiety 
relating to his academics and future career. He states that 
these factors contributed to his suicidal thoughts.
.
 At the time of the interview, he reported he was regretful of 
his suicide attempt, noted that the first 12 hours following it 
were "scary", but that now he feels "fine". He reiterates that 
his attempt was "impulsive" and denies SI currently. He 
describes great difficulty dealing with depression his first 
year of college, which was severe and led to hindered academic 
performance (which continues to cause him anxiety), but 
describes strong family support and good relationship with his 
therapist. He endorses hopefulness. Patient repeatedly states 
that he "feels fine" and does not want to stay in the hospital.
.
 Since this ___, the patient has started seeing two new 
therapists (The ___ in his native ___ over ___ break, and the 
___ at ___ Student Health Services). He has a provider that he 
sees every 10 days that prescribes him Prozac, which he feels

sleep. He mentions in his first year of college with severe 
depression and insomnia. At times he would stay up all night 
till 8AM, and then fall asleep, missing up to ___ of his classes 
and many assignments. His depression greatly hindered his 
academic performance and GPA. Since this Fall semester, he is 
sleeping ___ hours nightly, going to bed early, and using his 
"new mindset" and coping techniques to address his anxious 
racing thoughts before bed, allowing him to sleep. Additionally, 
he takes Benadryl about every other night (~4x a week) to help 
him sleep.
.
He now still misses about ___ of his morning classes and is 
unable to get out of bed in the morning. However, he feels that 
his mental health has been overall improving. Academically, he 
feels that he is doing much better this semester. Having changed 
majors, he continues to face intense anxiety over his academics, 
career, and the "uncertainty" of his future.
.
Per the BU therapist's collateral (see OMR note by Dr. ___, 
patient reported a suicide attempt which failed when the belt 
broke. The patient saw the therapist on call (not his regular 
therapist) who instructed him to go to the hospital. The 
therapist strongly felt that the patient needed to be 
hospitalized. This is the patient's third suicide attempt ___ 
in the ___ and ___ in the ___, all three by 
hanging with a belt. Previously, patient did not report the 
attempts until some months afterward. Patient reported to 
therapist that he intended to die and did not cease the suicide 
attempt voluntarily."    
.
In the ED, no chemical or physical restraints were required.
.
On interview today, patient notes feeling "worried" and 
"nervous" regarding this admission. He feels the admission is 
unnecessary because with this suicide attempt he reached out for 
help telling two close friends ___ and ___) about 
the suicide attempt and he went to his therapist. He notes his 
problems won't be fixed through an inpatient admission and 
rather require more long term treatment. 
.
Regarding the most recent suicide attempt, he reiterates what 
was said above. He mentions that he got into a conflict with a 
friend, and he "lashed out" and acted "impulsively". He 
currently denies suicidal ideation. He notes a history of 
emotional dysregulation, letting his emotions "pile up" to the 
point of an emotional outburst with verbal altercations with 
people. Denies physical harming another individual. He notes for 
the past month his mood is "generally good" although he 
typically feels "down" ___ a day. He does state some difficulty 
with concentration and motivation regarding school. He states 
however, that these symptoms and his mood have somewhat improved 
over the past year, and he notes being more, "self-confident". 
Denies changes/problems with sleep, energy, and appetite. He 
states he last had suicidal thoughts 8 months ago. Regarding his 
previous suicide attempts, he stated he "forgot" the 
circumstances prior to these events, but believes the 
medications he was on at the time were not working. When asked 
what things he is looking forward to he stated "I don't think 
about the long-term, but for the short-term going home and 
graduating." 
.
He stated the Prozac was increased in the last month, and he has 
been on this medication for 3mo. He feels it has helped some 
with improving his mood. He currently endorses some nausea and 
GI upset with the increase, but he does not find these side 
effects intolerable.

that level of observation throughout while being unit 
restricted.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
___ y/o male college student with history of 2 suicide attempts 
who was BIBA on a section 12a from ___ health ___, 
following a suicide attempt by hanging with a belt. Initial 
interview significant for high lethality and low-rescue suicide 
attempt. He notes the suicide attempt occurred "impulsively" 
after a trivial argument, and he notes a history of emotional 
dysregulation. He denies the involvement of alcohol during the 
incident, but does report history of 2 x weekly binge drinking. 
His current report of him aborting the suicide attempt is in 
contradiction to the collateral report from his therapist. He 
denies current suicidal ideation, however, he does not elaborate 
on things he is looking forward to in the future, which is 
concerning. He reports many depressive symptoms namely low 
motivation, irritability, poor concentration, and hypersomnia.  
He also notes anxiety and stress regarding his school work. 
Mental status exam significant for patient with good grooming 
who appears anxious with increased psychomotor agitation. He has 
poor insight and judgment.
.
Diagnostically, the presentation is concerning for major 
depressive disorder, recurrent with anxious features. The 
patient is noted to have some maladaptive behavior namely 
emotional dysregulation and impulsivity. The patient's alcohol 
use could be contributing to both the depressive mood and 
emotional dysregulation. 
.
Initially, he was noted to have poor limited insight into what 
led him to become acutely emotionally dysregulated, stating, "We 
got in a fight about taking out the trash. I don't know what 
happened after that, but then I had a belt around my neck." 
Similarly, patient was unable to provide much insight regarding 
his thought process or emotional state during prior suicide 
attempts by strangulation/hanging (both within the past ___ 
years). Given patient's report of episodic, but persistent, 
emotional dysregulation over the past couple of years, the team 
introduced DBT concepts to the patient. He worked on the DBT 
crisis survival skills worksheets and functional analysis 
worksheets. The patient showed a willingness and openness to 
completing the worksheets, verbalizing his goal of achieving 
improvement in his emotional dysregulation and a decrease in his 
impulsivity. With functional analysis the patient identified 
other preciptating events that likely contributed to his 
heightened distress the day of the suicide attempt (e.g not 
doing well on a test, pledge season at his ___, and 
argument with family member). He listed things he would do if he 
noticed himself becoming emotionally dysregulated, including 
splashing cold water in his face, playing xbox, and/or flashing 
a light into his eyes. The team counseled pt on deleterious 
effects of alcohol both on his mood and emotional dysregulation 
and encouraged alcohol cessation. He noted a willingness to 
discontinue alcohol use with the treatment team, but then later 
with his mother he stated some ambivalence regarding long term 
alcohol cessation.  
.
Given that the patient's fluoxetine had been increased 2 weeks 
prior to his admission and he felt some improvement in mood and 
sociability, he was just continued on home fluoxetine dose. 
While in the hospital the patient noted disruptive sleep and 
complained of feeling groggy with benadryl. The patient was 
switched to trazodone 50mg, which he tolerated for sleep. While 
hospitalized the patient adamantly denied ongoing thoughts/urges 
of suicide or self-harm, and he verbalized a willingness to 
reach out to outpatient providers following discharge if 
thoughts/urges to engage in self-harm return. On discharge 
mental status exam notable for mood congruent euthymic affect 
and verbalized future oriented noting goals to get back to 
school and finish out the school year.
.
The team communicated with outpatient psychiatrist who had 
recommended initiating lithium for both augmentation to 
depression treatment and anti-suicidal effects. The treatment 
team discussed lithium treatment in detail with the patient's 
mother and the patient. We provided a literature review of the 
evidence and information regarding the side effects of the 
medication. Ultimately, the patient declined initiating lithium 
in the hospital, but he voiced wanting to continue the 
conversation about lithium trial with his outpatient 
psychiatrist. Recommend continued behavioral therapy in the 
future. 
.
3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
# Alcohol misuse (Binge Drinking) - (see psychiatry above) 
counseled pt on deleterious effects of alcohol both on his mood 
and emotional dysregulation and encouraged alcohol cessation
.
4. MEDICAL
# No medical issues (see lab section for pertinent labs 
including BMP, CBC, TFTs, LFTs, Lipid Panel, and A1c)
.
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient declined to  attend these groups that focused on 
teaching patients various coping skills, noting a preference for 
individual therapy rather than group therapy. He was often 
isolative and kept to his room during the hospitalization.
.
#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
A family meeting occurred with the patient's mother and the  
primary treatment team which provided her the opportunity to 
discuss the patient's diagnosis, treatment  plan, prognosis, and 
aftercare planning. The patient's mother was in agreement with 
overall treatment plan and discharge plan.  
. 
Additionally the treatment team spoke to both the outpatient 
therapist and psychiatrist regarding patient's presentation, 
history, treatment suggestions, plan, and aftercare planning.
.
#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: initiated trazodone 50mg
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Coordinated w/ BU, outpatient 
psychiatrist
- Behavioral Interventions (e.g. encouraged DBT skills, ect): 
Crisis intervention DBT worksheets and functional analysis 
worksheets
.
INFORMED CONSENT:  Trazodone
The team discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, 
and possible side effects and risks of starting this medication, 
and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medication, with this patient.   We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any questions about medications 
with the treatment team.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.
.
RISK ASSESSMENT 
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself  based upon "impulsive" 
suicide attempt.  Their static factors noted at that time 
include history of suicide attempts, chronic mental illness, 
history of substance abuse, male gender, and Caucasian race, 
age.  The modifiable risk factors included ongoing substance 
use, impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and limited coping 
skills. These were addressed by behavioral interventions (e.g 
DBT worksheeting and functional analysis) and alcohol use 
counseling. Additionally, the patient was started on trazodone 
to improve sleep. Finally, the patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors, help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint,  life satisfaction, reality testing 
ability, good coping skills, good problem-solving skills, 
positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, 
lack of suicidal ideation, and strong social supports. At the 
time of discharge the pt demonstrated preserved capacity to 
engage in meaningful conversation about safety planning and what 
he would do if thoughts of suicide or self harm returned. The 
patient verbalized a willingness to reach out to outpatient 
mental health providers if suicidal thoughts/urges returned. 
Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at this time, 
the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others.
