IMAGING STUDIES
================
CXR ___
The appearances uncharacteristic for pulmonary edema.  The 
differential 
diagnosis would include viral pneumonia and inhalation injury.  
Correlation with history is recommended. 

CXR ___
Persisting, but decreased extent of interstitial abnormalities, 
differential considerations are unchanged including pulmonary 
edema, viral pneumonia and inhalation injury.

MICROBIOLOGY
============
Blood and urine cultures negative at time of discharge.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with asthma, opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and 
recent discharge from OSH ___ after a fentanyl dose presented to 
___ following a fentanyl overdose. He was found down by family 
and given Narcan. Hospital course complicated by hypoxemic 
respiratory failure requiring brief MICU admission for BiPAP.

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure
CXR concerning for pulmonary edema that is suspected to have 
been from inhalation injury vs. aspiration event vs. Narcan 
administration. Patient was initially admitted to MICU for BiPAP 
given his respiratory failure but did not require intubation. On 
the day after admission, he was weaned off of BiPAP and 
transferred to the medical floor for further management. On the 
medical floor, he was weaned to room air. Notably, the patient 
had a fever the night of transfer to 101.2 associated with a WBC 
of 27.7, for which CAP treatment with ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin were initiated. The following morning, the 
patient's WBC downtrended to 12.9 and he had no recurrences of 
his fever, so antibiotics were discontinued. He remained 
afebrile after antibiotic discontinuation.

# Fentanyl overdose s/p Narcan
There was some concern by family that this may have been a 
suicide attempt, however the patient adamantly refused this 
notion. He was assessed by psychiatry who felt that 1:1 sitter 
was not necessary. They suggested consider naltrexone, suboxone, 
or methadone for pharmacologic treatment of his opioid use 
disorder. This can be considered in the outpatient setting.

# ___
Presented with Cr reportedly 1.7 at OSH, downtredned to 0.9 
while at ___. Suspect that it was likely prerenal, though the 
possibility of rhabdomyolysis in the setting of a elevated CK 
(2885) was also considered. IVF were deferred in the setting of 
pulmonary edema. UA was negative for myoglobinuria. His Cr prior 
to discharge was 0.9.

Transitional Issues
=====================
[ ] Opioid use disorder treatment - as above. Patient will 
likely need to be plugged in with OBAT as outpatient for 
consideration of pharmacologic treatment of his opioid use 
disorder.
[ ] Discharged w/ prescription for Narcan
