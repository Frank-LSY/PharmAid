Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was transferred from OSH with tSAH on CT s/p fall 
with headstike and LOC while being transferred to his wheelchair 
in his nursing home. 

#tSAH:
The patient appeared to be at his neurologic baseline with known 
history of dementia and right sided weakness secondary to 
history of L CVA. Repeat NCHCT showed stable tSAH. He remained 
neurologically stable on exam. 

#CV:

acute intracranial hemorrhage. He is to hold his anticoagulation 
until follow-up with repeat NCHCT in clinic.

trended down on repeat labs. Medicine was consulted and 
recommended decreasing Lasix to 20mg daily and to monitor for
