IMAGING:
CT abdomen/Pelvis ___
IMPRESSION: 
Bladder wall thickening is most likely related to chronic outlet 
obstruction
the setting of prostatic hypertrophy, however may be seen in the 
setting of
cystitis.  Please correlate with urinalysis.

Scrotal ultrasound ___
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of abscess, orchitis, or epididymitis.
2. Moderate right-sided hydrocele with a small amount of debris.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ presents with 2 days of chills, rigors, fever and dysuria 
admitted with urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis.

# UTI/Pyelonephritis: Urine cultures grew out pansensitive E. 
coli.  Patient was started on IV ciprofloxacin therapy, though 
despite several days of this he continued to spike fevers.  To 
rule out nontreated nidus of infection, he was sent for a CT 
abdomen and pelvis, and subsequently a scrotal ultrasound, both 
of which revealed no acute pathology.  A rectal exam was also 
performed, during which she had no prostatic tenderness, ruling 
out prostatitis.  Eventually he was evaluated by the infectious 
disease service, who felt his clinical picture was consistent 
with simply a UTI/Pyelonephritis with a delayed response to 
treatment. His leukocytosis resolved and his fever curve 
eventually did improve, and by hospital day 5 he remained 
afebrile Ã—24 hours.  He was cleared to return home, and will 
complete a 14 day total course of therapy with p.o. 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily on discharge.

#Prostate enlargement, urinary retention: Patient gave a history 
of progressive trouble voiding, urinary retention, and weak 
stream over the past several months.  This is likely due to 
progression of underlying BPH, and likely contributed to his 
development of a urinary tract infection.  He will be started on 
Flomax 0.4 mg nightly on discharge.  He already has a urologist 
through which he has regular PSA monitoring.  He was encouraged 
to follow-up with his urologist in the next few weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
You were admitted with a urinary tract infection treated with IV 
antibiotics. Urine cultures ended up growing E. coli, which was 
the cause of your infection. Despite being on the right 
antibiotic therapy, you continued to have fevers for a few days 
into your admission. A CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, as 
well as an ultrasound of your testicles were performed, which 
showed no other source of infection. To make sure we weren't 
missing something, you were seen by our Infectious Disease 
service, who agreed that your fevers were likely due to urinary 
tract infection with involvement of your Kidney, a condition 
called Pyelonephritis. Your fevers eventually resolved on 
hospital day 5, and it was felt safe for you to return home. We 
will send you home on a longer course of oral antibiotic therapy 
for your urinary tract infection. 
 
Followup Instructions:
