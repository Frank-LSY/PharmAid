History of Present Illness:
HPI(4): Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who is admitted to the
medical floor on a ___ for paranoia and agitation, being
treated for a urinary tract infection. Earlier today, ___ was in
the hospital visiting her sister who had just had surgery. ___
tells me that she was "just so worried" about her sister and got
in an altercation with the surgical team, and a "Code Purple" 
was
called. She was therefore placed on a ___ and sent to the
emergency room. In the ED, laboratory work up showed a UA c/w a
UTI. Both psychiatry and neurology were consulted. Neurology
recommended a lumbar puncture in the ED to evaluate for a
subacute meningoencephalitis. Psych stated that the patient did
not have the ability to make her own medical decisions, and
recommended treating of her UTI prior to further evaluation. She
was given a dose of IV ceftriaxone. The ED team spoke with both
the neurological and psychiatric team and decided to defer LP
given other likely diagnosis, and difficulty performing in a
patient who would not consent. She received several doses of
olanzapine IM for agitation.

On arrival to the floor, ___ was calm and gives a clear history.
She told me what happened above. Over the past several days, she
denies any urinary symptoms -- no dysuria, polyuria, or burning
on urination. She denies any headaches, fevers, chills, changes
in bowel habits. She denies any agitation, though tells me she
has been very anxious, especially about her sister. She denies
any joint pains, neck stiffness, vision changes. She does tell 
me
that around ___, she had what appeared to be a tickbite --
she allowed the insect to stay there for three days before it
fell off, and there was a ~1cm red lesion in that spot. She was
never tested or treated for Lyme disease. No joint pains. She 
ran
out of her thyroid medication last week, and had not yet picked
up her refill -- went a total of a week without medications.

I also spoke with her PCP on the phone. He has not had any
concerns about ___'s mental status (though was very concerned
about her sister). Tells me they have no family support, but 
that
he hadn't noticed anything otherwise wrong.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI.  All
other systems were reviewed and are negative.

IMAGING:
========

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormality on noncontrast CT head.  
Specifically no acute large territory infarct or intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
2. Additional findings described above, including opacification 
and sclerosis of the right mastoid tip.

MRI Brain ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute findings intracranially. 
2. Findings consistent with mild chronic small vessel ischemic 
changes. 

EEG ___:
Report Pending 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HLD and Hypothyroidism who was admitted with altered 
mental status and confusion. She was visiting her sister, who 
was hospitalized, when she had an acute behavioral outburst, 
prompting sending her to the ED. In the ED, her UA was 
consistent with a UTI, so she was started on IV ceftriaxone and 
admitted. Psychiatry evaluated her and placed her on a ___ initially, as she wanted to leave AMA and was determined to 
not have capacity to do this. On follow-up with psychiatry as an 
inpatient, the ___ was discontinued, but she continued to 
lack capacity to make the decision to leave AMA for several days 
due to persistent altered sensorium. Neurology also evaluated 
her and recommended workup for neurologic causes of sudden 
altered sensorium including stroke (CT and MRI were both 
negative, though with evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease) and auto-immune encephalitis (serum paraneoplastic 
antibodies and anti-TPO antibodies were pending at the time of 
discharge) and seizure (EEG was performed, preliminary results 
negative, final report pending). Of note, she had not been 
taking her levothyroxine for approximately a week prior to 
admission; her TSH was minimally elevated and her T4 was normal. 
Levothyroxine was restarted at her usual dose. Her urine grew 
>100k of 2 morphologies of E. coli. She was transitioned to oral 
Nitrofurantoin to complete a total of 7 days of antibiotics. 
Occupational therapy evaluated her and determined she did not 
require 24 hour care, as she was independent in ADLs and iADLs 
She was set up with ___ and Elder Services and was discharged 
home.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Pending tests at the time of discharge include the final EEG 
report, anti-TPO antibodies, free T4, and serum paraneoplastic 
antibody panel. These will be followed-up by neurology as an 
outpatient
- Patient has a reported penicillin allergy but received 
ceftriaxone without incident. She should undergo allergy testing 
in the future to verify whether or not she has a true PCN 
allergy.
- Patient would benefit from an outpatient neurocognitive 
evaluation given signs and symptoms concerning for mild 
cognitive impairment. 
- Patient set up with ___ and elder services. Would benefit from 
outpatient OT and outpatient referral to psychiatry. 

___ is clinically stable for discharge today.  On 
the day of discharge, greater than 30 minutes were spent on the 
planning, communication, and coordination of the discharge.  
 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
1. Levothyroxine Sodium 75 mcg PO DAILY 
2. Pravastatin 40 mg PO QPM

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital with 
confusion and agitation.  We found that this was most likely 
caused by a urinary tract infection.  We treated you with 
antibiotics, and your symptoms improved.  

Because the change in your thinking was so abrupt, our 
neurologists and psychiatrists both evaluated you.  They were 
concerned about a problem in your brain that could be causing 
your symptoms.  We did a CT scan of your head, an MRI, and an 
EEG.  The CT scan and MRI did not show any evidence of a stroke, 
and the results of the EEG are pending.  Because your thinking 
improved back to your baseline, the neurologists determined that 
you did not need further testing in the hospital and that you 
should follow-up with them in the clinic.  The psychiatrists 
determined that you should have some services at home to ensure 
your safety.  When these services were arranged, you were 
discharged home.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.
