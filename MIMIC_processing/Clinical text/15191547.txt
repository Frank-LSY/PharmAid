Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with a history of HTN, HLD, CAD s/p stent 
placement ___, paroxysmal Afib on apixaban, s/p pacemaker 
placement for bradycardia who presented with weakness
and fatigue and elevated CK. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# RHABDOMYOLYSIS 
Elevated to 7799 in the ED. Along with her elevated CK, she had 
elevated transaminases that likely also represent muscle injury. 
Unclear etiology. No evidence of increased exertion or heat 
stress. A rheumatologic cause was considered given elevated ESR 
at outpatient, but rheumatology believed this to be unlikely. 
She had a mildly elevated TSH with normal T4. Potentially in the 
setting of a drug reaction although she has stably been on her 
medications for a long time. She was recently given a course of 
ciprofloxacin, but this is not known to cause rhabdomylosis. She 
was given a total of 3L IVF with improvement in her CK, which 
had decreased to 3208 on the morning of discharge. 

# ___ on CKD 
She presented with a Cr of 1.5. This was likely in the setting 
of rhabdomyolysis and improved to her baseline with IV fluids. 

# NSTEMI
She presented with a troponin of 0.22 in the ED that slowly 
downtrended to 0.13 on the day of discharge. She had no chest 
pain. Cardiology saw her and believed that this was most likely 
demand ischemia in the setting of stress from her 
rhabdomyolysis. 

# TRANSAMINITIS 
Her AST and ALT were elevated, most likely in the setting of her 
rhabdomyolysis with muscle damage. They decreased at the time of 
discharge. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION 
She was continued on metoprolol (fractionated) and her home 
apixaban. 

# BREAST CANCER 
S/p surgery and radiation. She was continued on tamoxifen.

#HTN, HLD, CAD
Her statin and ___ were held in the setting of rhabdomyolysis 
and ___. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Please repeat the patients CK, LFTs, and BMP given her 
presentation with rhabdomyolysis with ___. 
[] HOLDING the patient's statin and ___ in the setting of 
elevated LFTs and Cr. 
[] Please recheck her TSH in 6+ weeks given subclincal 
hypothyroidism (TSH 5.9, normal T4)
