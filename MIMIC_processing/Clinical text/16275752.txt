History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo lady with h/o hypertension who presented
with acute onset substernal chest pain that started in the
morning prior to presentation. Patient's chest pain started 
while
she was on the phone and heard the bad news that one of her 
close
friend has passed away. Describes the pain as a dull, squeezing
pain localized over the sternum with radiation to the left
scapula. Pain is associated with nausea, subjective dyspnea,
palpitations, and DOE. Pain is constant and stuttering, with
stress and exertion worsening her chest pain. She also noted 
some
lightheadedness/dizziness which she attributes to her chronic
vertigo.

She notes dry cough for the past few months that she attributed 
to dry air (improved with humidifier). She denied rhinorrhea,
coryza, sore throat, fever, chills, presyncope, syncope, history
of DVT/PE, recent travel or recent surgery. 

 She presented to ___ with the above symptoms and was
noted have TWI/flattening involving leads V1-V2, V5-V6 along 
with
a troponin I elevated to 2.80. She received ASA 325 mg Ãâ"1,
Lovenox ___ mg subq and was started on nitroglycerin gtt. She 
was
transferred to ___ for further management. 

At the time of evaluation in our emergency room she reported 
that
her chest pain has significantly improved (now ___ in intensity
compared to ___ in intensity when it started) in the setting of
being started on nitroglycerin gtt.

Her exam otherwise remarkable for BP 120-150/60-80s, HR 60-80, 
RR
18, O2 sat 98% room air, temp 98.1. Cardiovascular exam with JVP
~7 cm H2O, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g, lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally, abdomen soft, NT/ND with NABS, no peripheral edema.
EKG with NSR 65 bpm, leftward axis, isolated Q waves in lead 
III,

IMAGING
=======================
___ Cardiovascular Cath Physician ___ 
___: Right
The LMCA is normal.
The LAD is normal.
The Circumflex is normal.
The RCA is a very large vessel with 40% concentric stenosis in 
the mid segment. There is no change in appearance after IC NTG.
There is question of weak collateral branch from a septal branch 
of the LAD to a branch of the RCA, but on careful review of the 
RCA, distal branches appear normal and no cut-off seen.
Intra-procedural Complications: None
Impressions: No hemodynamically significant CAD. Could postulate 
that may have had ruptured plaque in mid RCA with distal 
embolization, but not clear
evidence for this, and stent to mid RCA does not seem indicated.

___ Cardiovascular ECHO  LVEF 40% to 45% 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size 
are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with focal akinesis of the distal ___ of the left 
ventricle. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 
40-45 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w 
possible stress-mediated/Takotsubo cardiomyopathy vs. distal LAD 
CAD. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 
Elevated PCWP. No valvular abnormalities or pathologic flow 
identified.

acute onset of chest pain, not alleviated by nitro, EKG with 
isolated Q waves in lead III, T-wave inversions V4-V6 (dynamic) 
and a trop leak to .4. Decision was made to cath. Results showed 
large RCA vessel with 40% concentric stenosis in the mid segment 
and no change in appearance after IC NTG. Given concern for 
Takatsubo cardiomyopathy, echo was done prior to discharge with 
showed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w 
possible stress-mediated/Takotsubo cardiomyopathy vs. distal LAD 
CAD. On discharge, patient is doing well, euvolemic, no 
complaints. 

#Takotsubo cardiomyopathy 
#CAD
#NSTEMI of unclear etiology
History notable for acute onset of chest pain after hearing bad 
news of her friends passing. VSS, EKG with dynamic changes as 
above, trop peak to .4. Patient given nitro with no relief. Cath 
was done which showed 40% stenosis of large vessel RCA. Echo 
showed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w 
possible stress-mediated/Takotsubo cardiomyopathy vs. distal LAD 
CAD. Patient was discharged on aspirin, metoprolol, eplerenone. 
We recommended she start atorvastatin 80mg daily given CAD and 
risks vs benefits of atorvastatin treatment. Patient voiced 
understanding but patient declined atorvastatin therapy. She was 
evaluated by ___ prior to discharge who recommended home. Per 
discussion with attending patient does not need to be continued 
on Plavix or Imdur at discharge given high suspicion of 
Takatsubo cardiomyopathy.

#Hypertension
Several different adverse reactions to several different 
medications. Outpatient, she is maintained on clonidine. 
Continued while in house but held on discharge give normotensive 
during hospital stay and addition of metoprolol on this 
admission, with no orthostasis.

#Smoking
Counseled extensively on smoking cessation, and patient declined 
nicotine replacement therapy. Patient expressed interest in 
outpatient smoking cessation program at ___. 

#GERD
Continued home ranitidine 

Transitional issues:
[] Follow up with outpatient cardiologist in ___ weeks.
[] Consider outpatient behavioral support given recent death of 
friend 
[] Consider starting atorvastatin when patient more amenable 
[] Consider further counseling regarding smoking cessation.
[] Please follow up patient's blood pressure and adjust blood 
pressure medication dosage as needed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___.

What happened while you were in the hospital?
- You presented with concerning chest pain. We gave you 
medications to try to help alleviate the pain and it did not 
work. This made us very concerned. We saw that the protein 
"troponin" was found in your blood. Troponin is only found in 
the blood when there is injury to the heart. We did an EKG of 
your heart which did not show you were having a major heart 
attack, but it did have a few concerning changes.
- This all prompted you to have a coronary angiography. This is 
a study that looks at your heart vessels to find any blockage.
- The study showed that one of your heart vessels is 40% 
blocked, so no stent was placed. 
- An ultrasound of your heart was done or an echo which showed 
only the bottom part of your heart is not functioning the way it 
should. This is concerning for the diagnosis of takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome or stress induced 
cardiomyopathy.
- Because we started you on a new medication- metoprolol, and 
your blood pressure was normal, we discontinued your blood 
pressure clonidine to prevent low blood pressure.

What to do after discharge?
- Your abnormal echo and chest pain is likely from stress. To 
protect your heart as it recovers, we are prescribing new 
medications. 
1. Aspirin 81mg- take every day. This prevents future heart 
attacks by thinning the blood and ensuring blood and oxygen can 
get past any blockage. 
2. Metoprolol 25mg - take every night. This improves your heart 
function by helping it beat slower and better. 
3. Atorvastatin 80mg - although this is indicated, you shared 
you did not want to take this. This medication prevents further 
blockage of your heart vessels and also decreases your 
cholesterol. It also improves heart function. Consider starting 
this outpatient.
4. Eplerenone 12.5mg - take daily. This medication will help 
your heart recover. 
 
- Please follow up with your primary care doctor within 1 week 
and your new cardiologist within 2 weeks. Dr. ___ 
will call you to make an appointment. 

We are happy to see you feeling better.

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
