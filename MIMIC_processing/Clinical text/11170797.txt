History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a recent history of R 
peritonsillar abscess drained at OSH on ___, who presented back 
to the ED today due to persistent symptoms. Following the 
initial drainage on ___ she was discharged home but did not 
complete the PO abx she was prescribed because she had the 
liquid form of augmentin and did not realize that it required 
refridgeration, so it spoiled. She subsequently presented back 
to the ED yesterday with worsening pain, at which time she 
underwent repeat CT of the neck, which showed a small 1.3 cm 
abscess with surrounding phlegmon. She was noted to have a 
leukocytosis but no fever, mild trismus, and tender LAD. She was 
seen by ENT who offered to drain the remaining abscess, but the 
patient refused due to fear of needles. She was amenable to 
undergoing the procedure under anesthesia but the risks of this 
were felt to outweigh the potential benefits. She received 
unasyn and decadron in the ED yesterday, and returned home with 
PO antibiotics but then returned to care today due to persistent 
odynophagia. She notes severe pain with swallowing although no 
difficulty with breathing or obstruction to passage of 
secretions. She notes mild ear pain but denies changes in 
hearing or mastoid pain. She endorses some sweats overnight but 
no measures fevers or chills. She also endorses continued 
muffled voice. She continues to decline drainage without 
anesthesia. The case was discussed again with ENT who 
recommended admission for IV abx.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:

___ year old with no significant medical history presenting with 
persistent R-sided PTA in setting of antibiotic nonadherence 
(not intentional). She has small persistent residual abscess and 
surrounding phlegmon. Her failure to improve is most likely due 
to the lack of antibiosis and is expected to improve with 
successful antibiotic treatment. She has no signs of threatened 
airway. Appreciate ENT involvement. Will admit for pain control, 
IVFs in setting of severe odynophagia, and IV abx given 
inability to tolerate POs. 

#R Peritonsillar abscess
Had CT scan with small peritosilliar abscess. ENT was consulted 
and offered drainage which patient refused unless she could be 
under complete anesthesia. Given the size of the PTA the risk of 
this did not support moving forward.  She was started on IV 
unsayn transitioned to augmentin once she was able to take POs. 
She was given PRN chlorseptic spray, scheduled liquid tylenol, 
PRN liquid morphine for pain. She will need ENT f/u on d/c -

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted after you were unable to swallow your 
antibiotics to continue to treat your Peritonsillar abscess. You 
were seen in the ED where a CT scan was done which showed the 
small peritonsilar abscess. ENT was consulted and followed you 
while you were here. You were started on IV Unasyn and pain 
medications. As your pain improved you were able to eat normally 
and swallow oral antibiotics. You will need to complete 10 more 
days of Augmentin. You already had the medication at home. You 
will need to follow with ENT on discharge. 

It was a pleasure caring for you, 
Your ___ doctors
