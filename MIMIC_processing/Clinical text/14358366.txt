Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ with subacute cholecystectomy p/w 
jaundice and abdominal pain without fever, labs consistent with 
cholestasis and pancreatitis. Likely with choledocholithiasis 
from residual
stone, subsequently spontaneously passed given resolution of 
nausea/abdominal pain and improving LFTs. MRCP findings raised 
concern for mild cholangitis and acute pancreatitis.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Suspected choledocholithiasis, likely passed stone
# Acute pancreatitis
# Mild cholangitis
Given improved symptoms and improved LFTs, she likely passed the 
obstructing stone. Discussed with ERCP fellow, she was treated 
for cholangitis with cipro/metronidazole for ___ days after 
obstruction relieved (day ___. Reassuringly, she has no 
leukocytosis, fevers, or hemodynamic instability.
 - TI: ___ year follow up noncontrast MRCP is recommended for 3 mm
cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail (likely side-branch IPMN)

# Acute diarrhea
# C.diff colitis
C.diff PCR came back positive so she was empirically started on 
PO vancomycin. Her diarrhea rapidly improved after she was 
started on PO vancomycin. The C.diff toxin antigen came back 
negative, however given her dramatic response to treatment for 
C.diff, she was continued on PO vancomycin to complete a full 
course (10 days after she completes the cipro/metronidazole). 

# Moderate malnutrition in the setting of acute illness
She reported losing significant weight in the past 2 months. She 
was seen by nutrition who provided education and recommended 
meal supplements (Ensure Enlive TID) and multivitamin with 
minerals.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] ___ year follow up noncontrast MRCP is recommended for 3 mm 
cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail (likely side-branch IPMN)
