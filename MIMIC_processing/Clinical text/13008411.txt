HPI: The patient is an ___ year old man with a past medical
history of HTN, HLD, DMII, CAD s/p CABG ___ years ago, vtach s/p
AICD who presents to ___ s/p tPA for acute onset expressive
aphasia, right face and arm weakness with NIHSS 5. 
Patient reports that he was in his usual state of health today
when he was speaking with his daughter and his wife.  He said
that suddenly he was unable to get the words out that he was
thinking.  This began at 4:50 ___.  He said that he was able to
understand what people were saying to him, and knew what words 
he
wanted to say but felt that there was a disconnect between what
he wanted to say and actually getting the words out.  He said he
did not feel that his speech was slurred.  His daughter noticed
that he had a right facial droop, as well as right arm weakness
and EMS was called.
He was brought to ___ and he was found to have
an ___ stroke scale of 5 for expressive aphasia, right facial
asymmetry, right upper extremity weakness and he was given TPA
starting at 18:20. He improved while receiving tPA, and then
symptoms re-appeared during infusion, so CTH was repeated. There
was no bleed on CTH, so the infusion was continued. He was
subsequently transferred to ___ for post TPA care. There was 
no
LVO occlusion on CTA so patient was not deemed a candidate for
thrombectomy.
On admission to ___, the patient was back to his neurologic
baseline and reported no further or finding difficulties.  He
said that his speech improved while he was receiving TPA and on
the drive over, and he feels it resolved within 20 minutes of 
the
medication.  Currently, he feels so well that he would like to 
go
home.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient currently denies
headache, lightheadedness, or confusion. Denies difficulty with
producing or comprehending speech. Denies loss of vision, 
blurred
vision, diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty,
dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies focal muscle weakness, 
numbness,
parasthesia. Denies loss of sensation. Denies bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

Patient denies any recent illnesses, fever, chills.

IMAGING:
===========
CTH ___ (24 hours s/p tPA)
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of large territorial 
infarction,hemorrhage,edema,or 
mass-effect.  There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci 
suggestive of age-related atrophy. Periventricular white-matter 
hypodensities are 
nonspecific, but likely represent sequela of chronic small 
vessel ischemic 
disease. 
  
There is no evidence of acute fracture.  The visualized portion 
of the 
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities 
are clear.  The visualized portion of the orbits are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
No acute intracranial process. 

TTE:
====
TTE: The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction 
is
45-50%. No structural cardiac source of embolism identified. 
Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional dysfunction
c/w CAD (LCx/ RCA distribution), with mildly depressed overall
systolic function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with 
borderline
free wall hypokinesis (likely
intrinsically further depressed) with moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Mild aortic, mitral and pulmonic regurgitation.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is an ___ year old man with a past medical history 
of
HTN, HLD, DMII, CAD s/p CABG ___ years ago, vtach s/p AICD who
presents to ___ s/p tPA on ___ at 16:20 for acute onset 
expressive aphasia,
right face and arm weakness with NIHSS 5. 

On presentation to ___ NIHSS 0 and 48 hours after receiving 
tPA NIHSS was still 0. He reports his symptoms resolved while 
receiving tPA and only lasted about 70minutes in total duration. 
Neurological exam on admission notable for mild right deltoid 
and IP weakness on the right in the 5- range which had resolved 
the morning after presentation. Etiology of patient's acute 
onset aphasia and right sided weakness is concerning transient 
ischemic attack vs. aborted stroke. No stroke was seen on CTH 
and CTH and clinical exam remained stable after tPA. His 
defibrillator was interrogated by cardiology and had reported 
normal function and battery. He was found to have new atrial 
fibrillation seen on telemetry and a 12 lead EKG. After 
discussion with his cardiologist Dr. ___ aspirin was 
discontinued and he was started on apixaban 5 mg BID. TTE did 
not show structural or cardioembolic source of infarct. Other 
stroke risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, and high 
cholesterol. Further toxic, infectious, and metabolic workup was 
unrevealing. Day of discharge patient reported to be at his 
neurologic baseline.

# Aborted Stroke vs. Transient Ischemic Attack
- Stroke Risk factors: A1c: 6.5, LDL:37
- Apixaban 5 mg BID
- Stop daily aspirin
- Continue atorvastatin 40 mg daily

# CV:

bradycardic to high ___ during admission. Can be increased by 
outpatient cardiologist

#Diabetes

==================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[]Follow up with neurology for aborted stroke vs. TIA in setting 
of new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation
-Apixaban 5 mg BID started after discussion with patient's 
cardiologist Dr. ___ 81 mg daily
[] Follow up with Cardiology as scheduled

- Decreased metoprolol to 12.5 mg BID as heart rate was as low 
as 39 in the hospital

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of acute onset expressive
aphasia, right face and arm weakness with NIHSS 5 resulting from 
a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK versus an ABORTED ACUTE ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation 
- Diabetes
- 

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Decrease metoprolol tartrate to 12.5 mg twice daily as your 
heart rate was as low as 39 in the hospital. This can be 
increased by your cardiologist as needed.
- Stop taking Aspirin daily
- Start taking Apixaban 5 mg twice daily for your atrial 
fibrillation to prevent clot formation

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology, cardiology and your primary 
care physician as listed below.  

 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 

Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team
