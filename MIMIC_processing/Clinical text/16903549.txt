ERCP:
performed with sphincterotomy/sphincteroplasty and extraction of 
3 large stones (8-12mm). Cholangioscopy with ___ performed for 
fragmentation of a retained 15mm stone followed by extraction of 
stone fragments. Given high stone burden, double pigtail plastic 
stent placed.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ ___ male with 
history of HTN, GERD and ? chronic hep B on tenofovir who 
presents with 3 days of epigastric and RUQ pain and jaundice, 
found to have choledocholithiasis on outpatient MRCP.

# Biliary obstruction
# Choledocholithiasis
# Concern for early cholangitis
Presented with episodic abdominal pain and found to have 
choledocholithiasis on outpatient MRCP. He then was told to 
present to the ED where he was found to have a mild 
leukocytosis. RUQ US was obtained and was notable for CBD 
dilation.
He had chills but no observed objective fevers, but was started
on antibiotics in the ED due to concern for cholangitis. He was 
transferred to ___ for ERCP. He underwent ERCP which revealed 
multiple filling defects consistent with stones. Stone 
extraction, lithotripsy, spinchterotomy, and plastic stent 
placement were performed. He will need a repeat ERCP in ___ 
weeks for stent pull. Antibiotics were discontinued after ERCP 
given lack of any purulence or findings concerning for infection 
during procedure. Post-ERCP he was hydrated with fluids 
overnight. The following morning diet was advanced and he was 
tolerating a regular diet at time of discharge. General surgery 
was consulted and recommended further evaluation for 
cholecystectomy as an outpatient. He was instructed to discuss 
with PCP to arrange outpatient evaluation. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:

# HTN: held home antihypertensives due to initial concern for 
infection. BP remained well controlled off medications so they 
continued to be held on discharge. Consider resuming as needed 
as an outpatient.

# HLD: Continued on home simvastatin

# GERD: continued home PPI

#? Chronic Hep B: continued home tenofovir 

Transitional Issues:
====================
- needs repeat ERCP in ___ weeks for stent pull
- needs outpatient referral for cholecystectomy 
- monitor BP and consider resuming anti-hypertensive regimen as 
needed
