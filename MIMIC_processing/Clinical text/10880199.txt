Brief Hospital Course:
=====================================
BRIEF SUMMARY 
=====================================

___ is a ___ year old women with a history of 
pulmonary fibrosis on Esbriet and prednisone, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, obesity (BMI 35), and acid reflux who presented 
with chest pain. 

On evaluation her troponin was elevated without ST elevations on 
EKG. She underwent cath for presumed type I MI but there was no 
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. 

We recommended an outpatient cardiac MRI for further evaluation 
to exclude alternative diagnoses such as myocarditis. 

The only medication change we made was adding atorvastatin 20mg 
daily for primary prevention after her lipid panel returned with 
an LDL of 189.
