Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of chronic 
alcohol use who presented to ___ on ___ with a 
pre-syncopal episode associated with diaphoresis, pallor, 
tremulousness found to have serum + for EtOH.
.
Active Issues:
.
#Pre-syncope: Differential diagnosis of his presyncopal event 
includes vasovagal, cardiogenic, orthostatic, or drug effect. 
Patient endorsed prodrome of lightheadedness, diaphoresis, 
pallor that occurred over minutes that supports vasovagal 
syncope. This was likely exacerbated by his recent alcohol use 
(serum tox level was 51 on admission)and he was possibly 
somewhat volume depleted given his ketonuria. Initial physical 
exam showed diaphoresis, tremulousness, and cerebellar signs 
consistent with alcohol intoxication/early withdrawal. ___ in ED 
was WNL, so hypoglycemia was unlikely contributing factor. Had a 
similar, but less severe episode ont he commuter rail 2 weeks 
ago, also after a weekend of drinking EtOH. His episode did not 
occur after rising to standing position so unlikely to be 
orthostatic syncope. Cardiogenic syncope (arrhythmia, 
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) was considered less 
likely given that he did not lose consiousness suddenly and did 
not have a true LOC. He underwent an ECG which showed normal 
sinus rhythm with left axis deviation as well as left 
ventricular hypertrophy and was placed on telemetry which 
demonstrated no electrical abnormalities. There was no evidence 
on history or physical exam to suggest seizure or TIA as cause.  

.
#EtOH Abuse/Tobacco use: Patient reported drinking ___ cups of 
vodka daily for the past ___s having recent 
alcohol use with serum tox positive for alcohol on admission. 
Therefore, there was concern for withdrawal and he was placed on 
a CIWA scale, although did not require any diazepam and 
manifested only mild tremulousness. He was started on folic acid 
1 mg QD and thiamine 100 mg QD daily and will be discharged on 
these as well. He was also placed on a nicotine patch given his 
significant tobacco use and supplied with prescriptions for 
nicotine patch and gum. 
.
#Gait disturbance: Patient describes feeling unsteady on his 
feet, particularly in shower and when he closes his eyes that 
has developed slowly over past year. His neuro exam was notable 
for proprioceptive loss in b/l toes, and wide-based gait with 
short steps, with an inability to tandem walk which was 
consistent with a sensory ataxia (disturbance of the dorsal 
columns or of peripheral nerves). This was thought to be 
secondary to a direct toxic alcoholic peripheral neuropathy 
complicated by concurrent nutritional deficiencies, although 
vitamin B12 level was normal. He was started on thiamine and 
informed that his alcohol use was the likely cause. 
.
#Hypertension: Patient was found to be hypertensive (max 
177/100) while in house and was started on chlorthalidone prior 
to discharge. He will need follow-up with PCP in next few days 
to address his blood pressure response. 
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#Depression: Patient stated that he has felt depressed over the 
past year, especially since the loss of his girlfriend ___ year 
ago. He expressed interest in mental health services and social 
work was consulted. 
.
#Tongue polyps: Incidentally found over ___ years ago and have 
not been a significant issue and been stable in size. However 
given his significant alcohol/tobacco history, his risk of 
tongue cancer is increased. THere was no friable tissue on exam 
and no associated lymphadenopathy. Follow-up of polyps by PCP is 
___. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. EtOH abuse: Patient drinking large amounts of alcohol daily 
and would benefit from supportive groups like AA, and continual 
counseling on the harmful effects of alcohol as an outpatient.
2. Hypertension: Patient started on chlorthalidone while in 
hospital. Blood pressure response/screening for side effects as 
outpatient is needed.
3. Depression: Patient admitted to feelings of sadness over the 
past year and was interested in speaking with outpatient 
psychiatrist. Should monitor symptoms of depression, consider 
treatment with SSRI/psychotherapy on an outpatient basis. 
Patient has had an extensive discussion with a social worker, 
who recommended grief counceling as outpatient. 
4. Tongue Polyps: Patient found to have two <1cm polyps on left 
lateral aspect of tongue. Should monitor growth/changes as an 
outpatient. 
5. Peripheral Neuropathy: most likely related to chronic ETOH 
abuse though pt was referred to neurology for outpt follow up 
and additional work up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ on ___ 
due to an episode of lightheadness and near fainting. You were 
worked up for possible causes of this episode including heart 
problems, problems with your blood, kidneys, or nerve problems. 
You underwent an electrocardiogram, which measures the 
electrical activity of the heart. This showed that part of your 
heart, the left ventricle, is enlarged (the wall is thicker), 
but did not show any abnormal rhythms or reasons to believe your 
episode was due to your heart. You also had a chest x ray which 
showed that the heart and lungs were normal. 

You were also found to have high blood pressure, which explains 
why the left side of your heart is larger (it must pump against 
a higher pressure). Your blood pressure can be controlled with 
the antihypertensive medication, chlorthalidone and you will 
need to follow-up with your new Primary Care Doctor to address 
your blood pressure response.

You mentioned also that your felt unsteady on your feet, 
particularly when closing your eyes. On your neurological exam, 
we found evidence of dysfunction of your peripheral nerves, 
which is likely directly related to toxic effects from alcohol. 
This can be treated by abstaining from alcohol and taking the 
vitamin, thiamine, which we prescribed.

We highly recommend that you cut down the amount of alcohol that 
you drink given that is having significant, harmful effects on 
your health. We hope that you also consider quitting smoking to 
avoid serious health consequences from this. In fact, if you 
quit smoking, your blood pressure will improve greatly. We have 
prescribed both nicotine patch and gum to help you with this.

The following changes were made to your medications:
-thiamine - take 1 tablet daily 
-folate - take 1 tablet daily
-chlorthalidone - take ___ of a 25mg tablet once a day
-nicotine patch - apply one patch to your skin (different place 
each day) daily
-nicotine gum - use this to control cravings. 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. Please 
follow-up at the below appointments.
