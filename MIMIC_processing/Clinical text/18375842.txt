Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with hx of HLD, GERD presenting with 
epigastric and RUQ pain x2 days, with lab evidence of 
cholestasis and cholelithiasis.  She was initially admitted to 
the medical service and her hospital course while on the medical 
service is addressed below: 

# ?Biliary obstruction:
# Elevated LFTs, cholestatic pattern: History was highly 
suggestive of biliary obstruction, although no biliary ductal 
dilation was seen on RUQ u/s from ___. She underwent MRCP 
which did not show any ductal dilation or obstructing stones but 
notable for gallstones. Her LFTs slowly improved. ACS was 
consulted and recommended ___. Patient went to OR on ___.   

# Thrombocytopenia: Patient with mild thrombocytopenia on 
admission with normal coags and albumin therefore not thought to 
be due to liver disease. Plts improved without intervention. 

# HLD:
- Held home atorvastatin in setting of LFT elevation

# GERD:
- Continued home omeprazole
- Discussed discontinuation of diclofenac as this may be 
contributing to GERD symptoms - pt has decreased to once daily

# Anxiety/agoraphobia:
- Continued home sertraline
- Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO q8h prn

On ___, the patient was taken to the operating room and 
underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intra-operative 
cholangiogram.  This procedure went well (reader, please refer 
to operative note for further details). After a brief, 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor 
tolerating on IV fluids, and oxycodone and acetaminophen for 
pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and 
abnormal liver function tests which were likely related to a 
gallstone you passed. You had an MRCP which did not show any 
stones in the biliary ducts or any blockages. You were taken to 
the operating room and underwent laparoscopic removal of your 
gallbladder. This procedure went well.  You are now tolerating a 
regular diet and your pain is better controlled.  You are now 
ready to be discharged home to continue your recovery.

Please note the following discharge instructions:

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

you did before, unless you have been told differently.

take, please call your surgeon.
