Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD #1, she was tachycardic and was given a 500ml bolus of 
normal saline.  The following day, she was given another bolus 
of fluid (one-liter) for persistent tachycardia.  She remained 
tachycardic post-bolus and was requiring additional oxygen.  She 
was sent for a CT to rule out pulmonary emboli.  CT was negative 
for pulmonary embolus.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing was changed and the Silverlon dressing was removed on 
POD#2. The surgical incision was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen 
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the 
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity. 
 
Mrs ___ is discharged to home with services in stable

4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These 
medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be

anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs such as Celebrex, 
ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, naproxen etc) until cleared by 
your physician.
 
8. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your Lovenox for four (4)
