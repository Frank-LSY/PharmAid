was well controlled on PCA, hydrated with intravenous fluids for 
urine output >30cc/hour, provided with pneumoboots and incentive 
spirometry for prophylaxis, and he ambulated once. On POD1, the 
patient was restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet for breakfast and lunch.  Diet 
was advanced to regular after lunch and with further ambulation, 
the JP drain was removed.  Foley catheter care and leg bag 
teaching was provided by nursing. The remainder of the hospital 
course was unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable 
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, and with pain 
control on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, dry, 
and intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection or 
infection. The patient was given explicit instructions to
