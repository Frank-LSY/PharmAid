Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___. You were 
admitted for observation after a mechanical fall resulting in 
rib fractures. Your pain was well-controlled with tylenol and 
tramadol. Incentive spirometry and early ambulation were 
encouraged, and you are breathing well on room air. You worked 
with Physical therapy, which cleared you for home with 
outpatient physical therapy. You are now ready for discharge 
home with pain medications and clinic follow-up. Please follow 
the below instructions for a safe and speedy recovery.

Rib Fractures:

* Your injury caused right-sided 3, 5, 10th rib fractures which 
can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow 
breaths because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).
