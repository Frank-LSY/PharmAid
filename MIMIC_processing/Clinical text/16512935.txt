Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of HTN who 
presented to BI-N for worsening fatigue, polyarthralgias, 
low-grade temp, and nausea/vomiting. She was noted to have 
hyponatremia of 125 that appropriately corrected. Labs and 
imaging were concerning for rheumatologic process for which 
rheumatology and pulmonology were consulted. Bronch was deferred 
and she was discharged home with plans for further outpatient 
work-up.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
PCP
[] Discharge Na+ 132. Home lisinopril and HCTZ were held as 
systolic BPs in 120s and hyponatremia still resolving. Please 
recheck sodium at first PCP appointment and consider restarting 
anti-hypertensives
[] Having mild nausea on discharge, sent home with ondansetron 
rx. Please follow-up resolution of nausea

Rheumatology/Pulmonology:
[] Multiple autoimmune labs pending at time of discharge. Please 
follow-up labs.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Cough
#Polyarthritis
Most likely undiagnosed rheumatologic process. Initial 
presentation notable for dry crackles and inflammation of PIP 
joints and wrists bilaterally. At BI-N, labs notable for ___ 
titer 1:160 in speckled pattern and CT finding of "Patchy 
peripheral opacities with subpleural extension within bilateral 
lower lobes, with basal predominance" that was suggestive of 
infectious vs nonspecific interstitial pneumonia; with the later 
being favored. Infectious workup was negative, including lyme, 
erchiliosis, babesia, anaplasma, monospot (EBV), HBV/HCV, and 
Legionella, was negative. She completed course of doxycycline as 
outpatient before presenting to hospital without resolution of 
symptoms, and was initially given IV CTX and azithromycin in the 
ED, which was discontinued due to lack of convincing objective 
and subjective evidence of infection. Rheumatologic workup to 
identify a specific autoimmune diagnosis (including anti-CCP, 
dsDNA, RNP, ___, Scl-70, SSA/SSB, centromere, and C3/C4) was 
sent (still pending) with plans for rheumatology outpatient 
follow-up. Pulmonary was consulted to consider a 
brochoscopy/BAL, but this was deferred given low suspicion for 
infection with plans for outpatient follow-up.

#Hyponatremia
Presented with sodium of 125 in setting of vomiting and poor PO 
intake which may caused her to become more sensitive to home 
HCTZ. HCTZ was held. Sodium appropriately improved with PO 
intake. Discharge Na 132 with HCTZ and lisinopril held until 
follow-up with PCP at which point she should like restart these 
medications.

#Nausea
Still having some nausea at discharge. Sent home with 
ondansetron.
