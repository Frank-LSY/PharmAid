HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. A
1.8 cm hypodense lesion in the liver segment 2 and 1.3 cm lesion

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain. 
Abdominal/pelvic CT revealed acute appendicitis. The patient was 
consented for surgery and she underwent laparoscopic 
appendectomy in the early morning of ___, which went well 
without complication. For further details of the procedure, 
please see the Operative Report. The patient remained in the 
PACU for several hours while awaiting a bed on the floor. 

The patient did very well in the PACU. She was hemodynamically 
stable. Her pain was well-controlled on minimal oral medication. 
She was tolerating a diet with no nausea or vomiting. The 
patient voided without issue. 

While still in the PACU, the surgical team received an email 
from the patient's PCP office stating that her urine culture 
taken the prior day was positive for E. coli. The patient does 
have a history of UTIs. The patient has not tolerated 
ciprofloxacin well in the past, so she was given a script for a 
5-day course of Macrobid on discharge.

The patient requested to be discharged while still in the PACU. 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled on oral medications. The patient was discharged home 
without services. The patient and her husband received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions. They verbalized 
understanding and agreement with the discharge plan. She was 
discharged with an incentive spirometer and prescriptions for 
acetaminophen and oxycodone, as well as a 5-day course of 
Macrobid. She was discharged with a follow-up appointment in 
place with Dr. ___.

laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and are now 
being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic.  More 
information is below.

Please continue all your home medications. You may take Tylenol 
(acetaminophen) for pain. We are also giving you a prescription 
for oxycodone for pain that is not controlled with Tylenol.
 
We also found that you had a UTI on testing that was done before

to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness".

medicine at one time than prescribed.

medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
