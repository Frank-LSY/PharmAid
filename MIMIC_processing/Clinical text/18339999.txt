Brief Hospital Course:
#Legal/Safety:
Patient was admitted to ___ on ___ and signed a 
Conditional Voluntary form. She remained on 15 minute checks and 
had monitored sharps access. She remained unit restricted given 
recent impulsive self-harm/suicide gesture of overdose by 
ingestion. Throughout the hospitalization, she remained in good 
behavioral control and without acute safety issues. She did not 
require any chemical/physical restraints.

#Major depressive disorder:
At the time of admission, patients presentation was notable for 
three weeks of labile mood (complaints of on/off 
euthymic/depressed days, with depressive mood not lasting more 
than one or two days), intermittent nights of sleep disturbance 
primarily with notable psychosocial stressors (such as exams), 
low energy, and four weeks of poor concentration. Exam was 
notable for mildly anxious-appearing affect, but grossly 
euthymic/reactive affect and future/goal oriented thought 
process. She denied persistently depressed mood lasting longer 
than 2 weeks, hopelessness, excessive guilt, or recurrent 
thoughts of death and was not thought to meet criteria for major 
depressive disorder at this time. However, given the potentially 
serious consequences of the impulsive overdose attempt by 
ingesting up to 20 tablets of sertraline in the setting of mood 
lability and anxiety, discussion was held with the patient and 
risks/benefits of lamotrigine was discussed, which she expressed 
an understanding of and being on-board with initiation. 

Patient was started on lamotrigine 25mg PO QHS on ___, which 
she tolerated without notable side effects. She reported 
improved mood and sleep since initiation of lamotrigine. By time 
of discharge, lamotrigine uptitrated to 50mg PO QHS which she 
tolerated with good response without concerning side effects. By 
time of discharge, patient had stable euthymic mood and affect, 
consistent lack of suicidal ideation, lack of desire to 
self-injure, improved sleep, increased energy, hopefulness, and 
had notable future/goal oriented thinking with actively engaging 
in disposition planning include re-entry to school. She also did 
not show signs of anhedonia, as she was engaged in the 
milieu/group therapy sessions, and also reported looking forward 
to getting back into performing with her ___ group once 
discharged.

#Sertraline overdose:
Patient reported having taken up to 20 tablets of sertraline 
25mg at the time of presentation. She was cleared by Toxicology 
in the ___ and was not found to have signs/symptoms necessitating 
medical interventions. Since admission to Deaconess 4, patient 
initially complained of mild weakness in her legs, tremulousness 
in her upper extremities, and lightheadedness. She was monitored 
closely for signs/symptoms of serotonin syndrome. After the 
initial night, patient no longer complained of weakness, 
tremulousness, or lightheadedness, and vitals remained stable. 

#Social:
After verbal consent was obtained from the patient, the 
treatment team contacted patients mother to update her 
regarding the presentation, reasons/indications for 
hospitalization, treatment goals/progress, and the disposition 
plan. Patients mother was on-board with the treatment plan and 
goals, as well as the disposition. Treatment team also worked 
cooperatively with patients ___ to schedule a re-entry 
date and appointment, with psychopharmacology bridging through 
the ___ until patients intake for the 
local psychopharmacologist/therapist referral. Patient was also 
provided with a primary care physician referral through ___ 
___ Associates as she did not have a local primary care 
physician. 

#Consent:
Risks and benefits of initiating lamotrigine for mood control 
was discussed with patient. She was provided with details of 
potential adverse effects, including nausea, drowsiness, 
fatigue, skin rash, as well as the importance of re-starting the 
medication if she were to discontinue for longer than 48 hours. 
Patient verbalized understanding of the risks/benefits and gave 
verbal consent for initiation.

#Risk assessment, prognosis:
At the time of admission, the patient was determined to be at an 
elevated risk of harm to self due to symptoms of an unspecified 
depressive disorder. Static risk factors that increase the risk 
of the patients potential for self-harm include history of 
self-injurious behavior by cutting, age of ___, single marital 
status, LGBTQ identity, and possible presence of a concurrent 
personality disorder. Modifiable risk factors present at the 
time of admission which were addressed throughout the hospital 
course include medication nonadherence (patient was initiated on 
lamotrigine and was compliant with daily doses), limited coping 
skills (was provided coping skills/techniques through daily 
individual/group therapy sessions, no established outpatient 
treatment in the local area (referral made for post-discharge 
follow-up), and impulsivity (patient was guided through a chain 
analysis regarding her impulsive action of overdosing on 
medications in a time of distress, was also given 
tools/techniques to avoid impulsive reactions in times of 
distress). At time of discharge, protective factors that help to 
mitigate the risk factors include help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, no 
irritability/agitation, reality testing ability, lack of 
suicidal ideation, no history of substance use disorder, no 
history of abuse, and strong social supports. With adherence to 
medications and post-discharge aftercare as recommended, the 
treatment team found the patients prognosis to be fair.
