thrombus. He also had bilateral carotid carotid duplex studies 
which showed less than 40% narrowing bilaterally.

arterial line removed, and he was tolerating a regular diet

bed to chair, his left thigh dressings were taken down as 
normal. 

Neuro: Pain was well controlled on oral medications¦
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. 
Pulm: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
oxygen saturation was routinely monitored. Had good pulmonary 
toileting, as early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
