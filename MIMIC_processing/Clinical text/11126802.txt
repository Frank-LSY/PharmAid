you underwent repair of the hernias with the placement of mesh.

discharge home with the following instructions:

feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.

weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.)

You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.

sense and go slowly at first.
You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL:

nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.

throat during surgery.

unappealing.

away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Your incision may be slightly red around the stitches or 
staples. This is normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin 
paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if they fall 
off before that that's okay).

go away.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

otherwise.

resume tub baths or swimming.

less prominent.

of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon.

medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine 
as directed Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do

surgeon has said its okay.
