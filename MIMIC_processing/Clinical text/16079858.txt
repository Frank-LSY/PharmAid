Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with carotid stenosis who was 
admitted to the ___ on ___. The patient was taken to the endovascular suite and 
underwent a right R transcarotid stent and L venous access. For 
details of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative 
note. The patient tolerated the procedure well without 
complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit 
in stable condition. He was noted to have some swelling at his 
right carotid entry site. The swelling remained stable, he was 
without any difficulty swallowing, dyspnea, or new neurologic 
deficits. He has an asymmetric smile which was evident prior to 
the operation. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred 
to the vascular surgery floor where he remained through the rest 
of the hospitalization. 

Post-operatively, he did well with some evidence of groin 
swelling. He retained 800cc in his bladder in the morning after 
his first void. He was straight cathed for 830cc. He 
subsequently retained again and had a foley place which produced 
another 800cc. He was given the choice of a second voiding trial 
in the morning or of being discharged with a leg bag and 
following up with his PCP early next week. He decided to go home 
with the leg bag and was instructed to call his PCP ___ to 
arrange for the voiding trial. At the time of discharge on POD 1 
he was able to tolerate a regular diet, ambulate well, void 
without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications 
alone. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the 
appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions.
