IMAGING:

CT/ANGIO CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS - ___ (OSH) - IMPRESSION:
-No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
-6 mm nodule in the right lung base along the major fissure
follow-up is recommended.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.
-Focal dissection near the origin of the celiac artery.  There
does appear to be flow distally in the hepatic and splenic
arteries.
-Right common internal and external iliac arteries are patent.
-Left common internal and external iliac arteries are patent.
-Ectatic arch of the aorta and abdominal aorta with mild
atherosclerotic change.
-Multiple cysts within the liver and kidney.
-The tail of the pancreas is enlarged at 3.5 cm recommend 
further
evaluation with dedicated assessment.

___: RUQ Abdominal ultrasound
1. Multiple hepatic cysts, the largest in the left lobe 
measuring up to 2.0 cm. 
2. Gallbladder sludge.  No cholelithiasis or other findings to 
suggest acute cholecystitis.  The CBD is normal caliber without 
sonographic evidence of choledocholithiasis. 
3. 4 mm nonobstructing right renal stone. 
4. Simple left renal cysts, the largest measuring up to 1.3 cm 
containing 
either coarse calcification or dependent layering internal 
debris. 
  
___ CTA abdomen:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Compared to ___, unchanged dissection involving 
the proximal celiac artery without extension distally into its 
branches or proximally into the abdominal aorta. 
  
2. Multiple simple left renal cysts.  A single left renal cyst 
demonstrates Hounsfield units slightly above expected for a 
simple cyst and may represent a hemorrhagic cyst.  If clinically 
indicated, consider ultrasound for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ on ___ with complaints of 
abdominal pain and found on imaging to have a celiac artery 
dissection. She was placed NPO and ordered for Aspirin 81mg 
daily. Her blood pressure was closely monitored and her home 
lisinopril dose (10mg daily) was increased to 10mg BID for 
better control. 

On hospital day #2 her labwork revealed an elevated bilirubin of 
1.9 and therefore a RUQ ultrasound was performed. This 
demonstrated biliary sludge only and no evidence of 
cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, or choledocholithiasis. 

On HD3, she underwent repeat CTA abdominal imaging which 
demonstrated stability of her celiac artery dissection. She was 
trialed with a regular diet--she initially experienced some 
persistent upper abdominal upper that resolved later in the day. 
She remained nontender on exam. Her labwork demonstrated 
persistent hyperbilirubinemia with TBR 2.1 ___s a new 
leukopenia with WBC 2.8. The medicine service was consulted 
given the constellation of lab anomalies and felt they were 
unrelated. The medicine service attributed the 
hyperbilirubinemia to likely ___ syndrome and recommended 
repeat CBC w/ diff as an outpatient in ___ days after discharge. 


On HD4, the patient continued to tolerate a regular diet and was 
discharged home in stable condition to continue aspirin therapy. 
Her labwork demonstrated a WBC of 3.5 and TBR improved to 1.3. 
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout her 
stay. Her blood pressure was well controlled on lisinopril 10mg 
BID. She will follow up with her PCP ___ ___ days for repeat 
labwork as noted above, in vascular surgery clinic in 4 weeks 
with repeat CTA abd imaging, and with her PCP ___ ___ weeks to 
monitor her blood pressure control.
