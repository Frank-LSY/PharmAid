History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old female with a long history 
of smoking and breast cancer diagnosed ___ years ago s/p 
lumpectomy and radiation who now presents with gradual onset 
progressively worsening SOB and DOE for 2 weeks followed by 
acute onset ___ left-sided back pain x3 days. Patient states

ambulating and talking. She denies cough, chest pain, 
fevers/chills, weight
loss or any other symptoms. She describes her back pain as sharp 
non-radiating pain in left flank to lower ribs with associated 
tingling in left shoulder. Pain exacerbates with deep breathing. 
She also reports significant decrease in appetite for several 
weeks. She quit smoking a week ago and endorses to being a 
smoker for ___ years (0.5 - 2.5 packs) with intermittent attempts 
to quit. 

She initially presented to the urgent care clinic 3 days ago for 
back pain. Following a CXR which was inconclusive she was 
scheduled for a CT-scan this afternoon at ___. Her chest 
CT showed multiple lobular and confluent pleural masses at the 
left lung base concerning for metastatic disease with large 
left-sided pleural effusion as well as collapsed left lung and
mediastinal shift. She was then transferred to the ED and 
thoracic surgery was consulted. Patient received IV morphine in 
the ED with improvement in pain and currently reports to be
comfortable. Patient has no obvious dyspnea and is able to speak 
in full sentences effortlessly.

MICROBIOLOGY
============
___ 10:33 am PLEURAL FLUID

   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: 
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR 
LEUKOCYTES. 
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. 
      This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, 
please refer to
      hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count.. 

   FLUID CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. 

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH. 

CYTOLOGY
=========
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
Consistent with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.
Note: The tumor cells are immunoreactive for TTF-1 and Napsin 
and negative for ER, PR, GCDFP and mammaglobin. 

IMAGING
=======
Chest CT ___:
1. Compared with the outside hospital chest CT of 3 days prior, 
there has been interval placement of a left-sided pleural 
pigtail catheter, with significant drainage of the pleural 
effusion. Only a small amount of pleural fluid remains. 
2. In the left lower lobe, a large area of peribronchovascular 
consolidations surrounded by ground-glass is presumably due to 
re-expansion pulmonary edema. This could be confirmed by serial 
radiographs, which are recommended at this time. 
3. In the lingula, a large mass corresponds with findings on the 
recent chest CT, and is concerning for a primary lung 
malignancy. Given the nodular pleural thickening and history of 
prior treated breast cancer, metastatic disease is also 
considered. 
4. Supraclavicular, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy is 
detected, as described above. 
5. Irregular soft tissue mass in the region of the left adrenal 
gland appears contiguous with nodes in the retroperitoneum, also 
concerning for malignancy/metastatic disease. 

CT from ___ (___): Multiple pleural masses at the 
left lung base consistent with metastatic disease. Large left 
pleural effusion occupying most of the left hemithorax. Collapse 
of most of the left lung. 5cm mass in left prevascular region 
extending into the anterior left mediastinum which could 
represent metastatic disease or pleural disease involving the 
mediastinum. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with h/o L-sided breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy, XRT) 
and ___ smoking history presenting with 2 weeks dyspnea on 
exertion found to have massive left-sided pleural effusion and 
pleural nodules concerning for metastatic disease.

#Pleural Effusion: Most likely malignant given history of breast 
CA and long smoking history with concern for metastatic disease 
on CT. If malignant, most likely primary lung CA given recent 
negative mammogram. Less likely infectious given absence of 
fever, cough and CT findings. Less likely auto-immune given no 
history of auto-immune conditions, no associated symptoms and CT 
findings. Thoracentesis drained more than 5L of serosaguinous 
fluid; chest tube was in place through ___. Pleural fluid 
with ___ RBCs, 450 WBCs, TP 4.7, LDH 338, glu 92, pH 7.39, 
most consistent with non-infectious exudative effusion. CT from 
___ confirming lingular mass concerning for primary lung 
malignancy as well as nodes in the retroperitoneum concerning 
for metastatic disease. Cytology shows adenocarcinoma of the 
lung. Serial CXRs and CT showed continued reexpansion pulmonary 
edema which was treated with lasix. Patient has primary care 
follow up and will be referred for oncology followup from there 
with her prior breast cancer oncologist. She had an MRI done at 
___ in the past several months, so no repeat MRI for 
staging was conducted. She should have a PET scan done as an 
outpatient for further staging purposes. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
-follow up additional cytology results
-close follow up with outpatient oncology- could consider 
speaking with breast oncologist Dr. ___ (former 
oncologist for breast cancer) about who she would recommend.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

Thank you for choosing to receive your care at ___. You were 
admitted with shortness of breath, and found to have a large 
left-sided pocket of fluid at the base of your lung called a 
pleural effusion. The interventional pulmonology team here was 
able to insert a drain into the pocked of fluid and evacuate it. 
Studies of the fluid suggest that it may be coming from a tumor 
in your lung, identified as a type of lung cancer called 
adenocarcinoma, which was also seen on a cat scan of your chest. 


You should avoid stressing your lungs (heavy lifting or 
exercise, airplane flights) over the next 2 weeks. 

We're sorry to give you such concerning news, and will make sure 
you are connected with close outpatient care so that you can 
continue the process of managing this illness moving forward. 
Your follow up appointments are listed below. 

We wish you all the best with your ongoing recovery. 

Sincerely, 

Your ___ care team.
