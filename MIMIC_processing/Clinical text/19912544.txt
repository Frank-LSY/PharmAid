Brief Hospital Course:
___ male transferred from OSH where he presented with 
headache as well as an acute episode of nausea and dizziness. 
CTA head/neck revealed a basilar aneurysm, so he was transferred 
to ___ for escalation of care. On arrival to the ___ 
ED, the patient was back to his neurologic baseline and denied 
any current nausea or dizziness. He endorsed a continued 
headache, although it was significantly improved with Tylenol. 
The patient was initially admitted to the ___ with the plan to 
take him for a diagnostic angiogram, but per conversation with 
his family, it was discovered that his aneurysm has been known 
for some time. No intervention was indicated, as it is already 
partially thrombosed. He was instead admitted to the floor for 
overnight observation to ensure that his presenting symptoms had 
resolved. He was kept on his home medications, including Aspirin 
and Plavix. On ___, he endorsed a slight headache, but no 
dizziness or nausea. Social work was consulted as he stated he 
only ate one meal a day at home, so he was provided with 
information for elder services. He remained neurologically 
intact and at his baseline throughout his admission, and was 
discharged home on ___. No neurosurgery follow-up indicated. He 
should follow-up with a Neurologist outpatient for his history 
of strokes.
