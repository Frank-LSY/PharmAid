Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ PMH of FAP (s/p colectomy ___, Recently Diagnosed
Intrabdominal Desmoid Tumor (initially resected in ___ in ___
when smaller, now recurrent and much larger), who was referred 
by
soon to be oncologist Dr ___ in advance of her 
initial
appointment for rapid workup and improved control of abdominal
pain.

As per review of records from ___, ___ has 
been
seen from ___ to ___ in the emergency department where
she has been noted to have increased in size of abdominal tumor,
for which a ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was performed
whose pathology revealed desmoid fibramatosis.  She was seen by
colorectal surgery at ___ who declined to offer
therapy as they felt her abdominal tumors were too large and too
complicated to be operated on at a community ___.  She has
not yet established care with an outpatient oncologist but was
due to see Dr ___, who referred her to the emergency
department for pain control and further workup. 

Pt reports that she has had left lower quadrant mass for many
years and was initially resected in ___ when it was much
smaller.  After resection it recurred and has grown since.  She
noted that she has persistent abdominal pain that is typically
left-sided and also occasionally in the right lower quadrant,
which is sharp/stabbing, and aggravated by long periods in the
same position (sitting/standing).  She noted that with taking
Percocet temporarily gets better but never is fully resolved. 
She notes that it interferes with her daily life and she is
unable to tolerate a normal diet as result.  She notes that she
frequently has diarrhea, that is nonbloody.  She noted that she
has fevers and chills at night. Noted that she presented on this
admission to initiate care with oncologist for surgical
evaluation as she would like the mass removed.

She otherwise noted that she was without sore throat, cough,
headache, shortness of breath, dysuria, rash

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.8 100 132/99 18 98% RA. WBC 9.5,
Hgb 14.3, plt 251, LFTs/CEHM/Lactate wnl. UA with 10WBC +
ketones, ___ prot, mod bld, mod ___, then was repeated and had 3
WBC, +keton, Tr prot, sm bld, tr ___.
 
CTH revealed:
No acute intracranial process. Please note that MRI is more
sensitive in detecting small intracranial lesions.

CXR revealed:
No definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 2 mm left
apical punctate opacity may represent vessel on end, calcified
granuloma, or a tiny pulmonary nodule. Please note that CT is
more sensitive in assessing for small pulmonary nodules.

___ was given dilaudid, Tylenol, IVF and admitted to 
oncology
for further care. 
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
A complete 10-point review of systems was performed and was
negative unless otherwise noted in the HPI.  

******************OSH IMAGING & PATHOLOGY*****************
CT A/P ___ from ___:
Compared to prior CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated ___
1.  There is a large persistent soft tissue mass involving the
left rectus musculature.
2.  Additional spiculated peritoneal masses are noted. 
Possibilities again include desmoid tumor or GI stromal tumor
3.  There is a persistent lobulated left adnexal cyst measuring
up to 2 cm there is a stable 1.5 subcentimeter area of subtle
enhancement within the inferior right hepatic lobe.  If
clinically indicated, this may be evaluated with MRI.
4.  Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation,
possibly due to chronic postcholecystectomy change, although
intrahepatic ductal prominence appears slightly more evident 
than
on prior study

CT A/P ___ from ___:
Since previous CT scan of abdomen and pelvis performed on
___
1.  Persistent large left suprapubic abdominal wall mass lesion
with interval increase in size, could be due to postbiopsy
hemorrhage.
2.  Persistent right lateral abdominal possibly mesenteric 
tumor,
with no significant interval change in size.
3.  Persistent possible slight interval increase in size of a
hyperenhancing subscapular right hepatic lobe segment 6 mass
lesion
4.  Unchanged status post cholecystectomy

MRI Abdomen ___:
8.2 x 8.0 x 10.1 cm markedly heterogeneous enhancing mass in the
left lower abdominal wall.  Differential diagnostic
considerations include desmoid tumor, soft tissue sarcoma,
endometriosis, and others.  3 nonspecific enhancing lesions in
the liver possibly focal nodular hyperplasia or less likely 
flash
filling hemangiomas.  Other etiologies cannot be excluded. 
Follow-up MRI abdomen in 3 months without and with contrast is
suggested to document stability

Pathology ___
Left lower quadrant abdominal mass, ultrasound-guided core 
needle
biopsy: Desmoid fibramatosis.  Specimen shows a cytologically
uniform fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferation with an
orderly fascicular architecture and a collagenous stroma.  There
is no atypia or pleomorphism.  The lesional cells are
multifocally positive for SMA and show multifocal nuclear
positivity for beta-catenin.  The appearances indeed fit very
well for a desmoid fibromatosis.  There is no evidence of
malignancy
