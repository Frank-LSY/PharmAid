Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ PMH Alzheimer's dementia p/w presyncope, fever and 
leukocytosis, found to have C. diff colitis

ACUTE ISSUES
==============
#C diff colitis: 
Patient unable to report symptoms, however with fever, diarrhea, 
leukocytosis, and CT A/P w/ evidence of colitis. She was found 
to be C. diff PCR and toxin positive. She was started on PO 
vancomycin on admission, as well as cipro/Flagyl for empiric 
colitis, which were discontinued once her C. diff resulted. Her 
leukocytosis improved and she was afebrile for 24h prior to D/C. 
She should complete a course of PO vanc until ___.

#Pre-syncope 
Felt to be ___ orthostasis iso diarrhea, no further events while 
inpatient. Given prior history of seizures, evaluated by 
Neurology in the ED who felt not a likely etiology. She didn't 
demonstrate orthostatic vitals, ambulated without issues, and 
received fluid resuscitation prior to D/C. No arrhythmia on 
telemetry.

#Iron deficiency anemia
Patient on admission w/ Hgb 12.1, felt to be hemoconcentrated 
from hypovolemia. Her iron studies were consistent with iron 
deficiency. Per her son, has not had a colonoscopy recently and 
prior ones had been unremarkable. Her Hgb slowly downtrended 
while hospitalized with no signs of bleeding. Discharge Hgb was 
10.3. Recommend discussion about outpatient work up of her 
anemia if within her goals of care. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
================= 
#Alzheimer's dementia
Continued home donepezil and memantine

#Hx of hypokalemia
Continued home potassium 

#Hyperthyroidism
Continued home PTU

#Hyperlipidemia
Continued home statin

#CODE: Full (confirmed)
#CONTACT: ___Son) ___

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Patient w/ iron deficiency anemia, discharge Hgb 10.3. If 
within GOC, work up for iron deficiency anemia should be pursued 
- endoscopy/colonoscopy
[] Evaluated by Neuro for possible seizure, was not felt to have 
contributed to presentation. An outpatient EEG with her 
neurologist could be further pursued. 
[] Incidental 3 mm lung nodule in the right upper lobe; no CT 
scan required if low risk patient, optional CT Chest in 12 
months is recommended in a high-risk patient. 
[] Please encourage hydration. Son was educated that in the 
future he should lie the patient flat during an episode, as 
propping her up will prolong the episode (if it is syncope) and 
could be more dangerous to the patient if she does proceed to 
have a convulsive seizure.
