History of Present Illness:
___ pmhx of CKD III (b/l Cr 1.2-1.3), HLD, AV insufficiency who 
presented to ___ after episode of syncope found to 
have Inferior MI on EMS EKG taken in the field. 

Patient reports a long standing history of Left arm pain with

also reported II/III/aVF ST elevations and reciprocal V5/6 
elevations on EKG.

He was taken to ___ where upon arrival to the ED his EKG was

to ___ for cath.

SUMMARY
=======
This is a ___ year old male with a past medical history of CKD 
III, HLD, and aortic valve insufficiency who presented with 
syncope and hypotension in the setting of alcohol and THC 
intoxication. At the OSH he was found to have EKG changes which 
were initially concerning for inferior ST segment elevations, 
but without enzyme elevations. These changes subsequently 
resolved.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Syncope
# Hypotension
The patient presented with hypotension and syncope which was 
thought to be a result of recreational drug-induced hypotension 
in setting of aortic insufficiency resulting in decreased 
coronary filling pressures and syncope. The patient was 
reportedly hypotensive however unclear severity and quickly 
resolved. EKG changes at initial presentation were reviewed and 
were not convincing for classic Type I inferior MI/STEMI. The 
patient does have multiple risk factors for CAD (smokes 
marijuana, HLD though well-controlled on statin, and has a 
positive family history), however had negative exercise stress 
test in ___. His ASCVD score is 16.8%. A cardiac cath 
was not indicated at this time. A coronary CTA was not able to 
be done as an inpatient, so we arranged for the patient to have 
this done this week as an outpatient. TTE was done which showed 
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/ global biventricular systolic function. Mild 
aortic regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets. Mild mitral 
regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Normal estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure. No structural cardiac cause 
of syncope identified. He was briefly on a heparin gtt which was 
discontinued. His home atorvastatin was increased to 40mg PO 
QHS.
