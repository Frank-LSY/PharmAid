History of Present Illness:
___ is an ___ yo right handed man with a history 
of metastatic SCLC with solitary left cerebellar brain met s/p 
gamma knife radiosurgery in ___ (gets care at ___) who 
presents with transient left arm weakness, as well as abnormal 
sensation in his face. 

The day of presentation he tried to pick up a glass of juice 
with his left hand at around 6:30 pm but found he was unable. He 
could reach to the glass and wrap his fingers around it, but 
couldn't bring it to his mouth. He denies having shaking in his 
arm. At the same time his left face began to "feel funny" like a 
swollen numb feeling. The arm was weak for ___ minutes. The left 
face was numb for ~7 minutes. Then, the sensation he had on his 
left face moved to his right face. He walked to the kitchen and 
told his daughter about his symptoms, who called an ambulance. 
He was taken to ___ where ___ was read as having a SAH 
vs. laminar necrosis with edema in the right parietal cortex. He 
was transferred to ___ for neurology evaluation. He denied 
trouble talking or walking. He doesn't know if his face was 
drooping. This morning, he feels back to normal apart from a 
mild headache, though this is similar to his chronic headaches 
which are a pressure like sensation in his forehead bilaterally. 


He gets care at ___ for "brain cancer and lung cancer". He's 
had radiation treatment for the brain cancer. He doesn't know 
what type of cancer it is, but denies it being a metastasis from 
his lung cancer. He says he was treated for his cancer ___ years 
ago and he's been told he is currently cancer free.

Images:

NCHCT ___
- ___ PRIMARY READ: ribbon-like high density in the right 
parietal lobe superiorly with surrounding mild intra-axial 
edema. Finding is nonspecific may be secondary to small 
subarachnoid hemorrhage or possibly laminar necrosis secondary 
to recent infarct in this area.
- ___ SECOND READ: 
1. Right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
2. Reported brain tumor not visualized on this non-contrast 
enhanced study and review of prior imaging is recommended. 

CTA HEAD & CTA NECK: WET READ ___
Non con head: Stable to perhaps minimal increase in right 
frontal 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Otherwise no significant change from 
prior. 
CTA: Final read pending 3D recons. The carotid and vertebral 
arteries and 
their major intracranial branches are patent with no aneurysm 
greater than 3mm, high-grade stenosis or other vascular 
abnormality. Numerous pulmonary 
nodules bilaterally. Comparison with prior imaging would be 
helpful to 
evaluate stability. 

MR HEAD W & W/OUT CONTRAST: ___
1. Sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity and leptomeningeal enhancement 
involving the right central, precentral and superior frontal 
sulci. Additional focus of leptomeningeal enhancement at the 
left frontal superior gyrus. Findings may represent reactive 
changes secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage versus 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, given clinical history of lung 
cancer.  
Consider correlation with CSF cytology and/or follow up imaging 
to 
characterize the evolution of these findings. 
2. Extensive bilateral cortical siderosis consistent with prior 
subarachnoid hemorrhages. 
3. No discrete parenchymal lesion. 

CXR PA & LAT: ___
The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  The cardiomediastinal 
contour is within normal limits.  The heart is not enlarged.  
There is a slightly prominent epicardial fat pad along the right 
heart border.  No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural 
effusion seen.  There are moderately severe multilevel 
degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is an ___ yo R-handed man with a history of 
metastatic SCLC (with a single cerebellar met s/p knife 
radiosurgery) who presented to OSH with transient left arm 
weakness, as well as left followed by right face numbness. A 
___ at ___ demonstrated a right frontal convexal 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, which may have prompted a seizure 
leading to his transient symptoms. The etiology of his SAH is 
unclear; the differential includes metastatic lesion from his 
known expanding primary lung cancer (no current evidence of 
MRI), amyloidosis (no evidence on MRI), AVM (no evidence on 
CTA), traumatic (no history but patient poor historian), 
aneurysm (not seen on CTA), or RCVS. 

Upon admission to ___, all of his labs were within normal 
limits; he was given Keppra 1000mg PO for seizure prophylaxis. A 
CTA of the head and neck showed no aneurysms with patent carotid 
and vertebral arteries. An MRI did not show any discrete masses 
or evidence of amyloid. It did show sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity 
and leptomeningeal enhancement involving the right central, 
precentral and superior frontal sulci. Additional focus of 
leptomeningeal enhancement at the left frontal superior gyrus. 
This could be consistent with reactive changes secondary to SAH 
versus leptomeningeal carinomatosis. The MRI also showed 
evidence of extensive bilateral sidersosis from prior SAHs. He 
improved over the course of his admission, and his neurological 
exam was unremarkable the day after admission. He was discharged 
home on 1g Keppra BID with plans to follow-up with his 
oncologist at ___ for further workup regarding the etiology of 
his SAH including outpatient LP once SAH resorbs and plans to 
have his PCP refer him to a neurologist for outpatient titration 
of Keppra.

Transitional Issues:
-Spoke with outpatient ___ on-call oncologist, Dr. ___ 
agreed to pursue further work-up for etiology of ___ as 
outpatient
- Will need to follow-up with oncologist, Dr. ___ evidence of mass or amyloid on MRI
- Will need outpatient referral by PCP to neurologist in home 
network for titration of Keppra; currently on 1g Keppra BID due 
to concern for seizure
- Will need outpatient monitoring of blood pressure (goal 
BP<140/90)
-CTA final read pending (wet read only)
-Numerous pulmonary nodules on CTA

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted with a brain bleed ("subarachnoid 
hemorrhage"). There was no evidence of a new mass on your MRI. 
It will be important for you to buy a blood pressure cuff and 
measure your blood pressure once daily at home and keep a diary 
of blood pressures. Bring this diary to your primary care 
doctor. Your goal blood pressure should be less than 140 for the 
top number and less than 90 for the bottom number. 

We are concerned that your symptoms may have been due to a 
seizure due to irritation of your brain by the blood. We have 
started you on a seizure medication (Keppra); you will need to 
take 1 gram twice a day.

We spoke with the on-call oncologist at the office at ___ that 
follows you for your cancer. It will be very important that you 
call them to make a follow-up appointment due to the growing 
cancer in your lungs and for further work-up to make sure you do 
not have a new mass in your brain. 

It was a pleasure meeting you!
Your ___ Neurology Team
