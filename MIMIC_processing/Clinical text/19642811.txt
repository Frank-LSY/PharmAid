 PSYCHIATRIC:
   #).Schizoaffective Disorder:
On admission interview, patient demonstrated clear paranoia and 
delusions.  He talked at length about concerns that he was being 
monitored by the CIA, and expressed concerns that there could be 
ninjas hiding among the hospital staff.  Patient endorsed clear 
AVH on discharge, reporting that he saw snipers outside of the 
building.  Patient had also made suicidal statements, stating 
that he had been thinking about eventually shooting himself at 
some point in the future in order to protect the President of 
the ___.  Patient also demonstrated some mood lability and 
expansiveness, and was at times hypersexual, verbally flirting 
with females on the unit, but notably was redirectable and 
maintained behavioral control overall.  In turn, patient's 
clinical presentation was most consistent with a decompensation 
of his schizoaffective disorder, likely in the setting of 
medication noncompliance.
.
From a psychopharmacological standpoint, patient was restarted 
on risperidone, which was gradually uptitrated to 3mg po BID. 
Patient was also written for Cogentin 1mg po BID to prevent EPS, 
as well as hydroxyzine 50mg po BID prn anxiety, insomnia.  To 
target mood lability, patient was started on Depakote, which was 
uptitrated to 750mg po BID.  Patient continued to demonstrate 
some paranoia and delusions on risperidone alone, so risperidone 
was augmented with ziprasidone, which was slowly uptitrated to 
ziprasidone 80mg po BID.  Patient tolerated this medication 
regimen well, and reported no adverse effects.  Platelets were 
somewhat low on admission at 144, and patient reported that this 
has been a chronic problem in the past.  Platelets were 
rechecked several times while on Depakote, and remained stable, 
last platelet count was 132 on ___.  Patient's outpatient 
provider should continue to monitor CBC as appropriate.  On this 
regimen, patient demonstrated much less paranoia.  He no longer 
reported any AVH, and did not appear to be internally 
preoccupied.  He reported that his overall mood was "better," 
more balanced, and demonstrated less mood lability.  Patient 
denied SI and HI consistently for several days prior to 
discharge.  Again, on day of discharge, patient denied SI, 
denied HI, denied AVH, and remained future oriented, with plans 
to clean up his apartment in ___ and go shopping for 
groceries with his PACT team.  Patient was  actively engaged in 
the therapeutic process, meeting with treatment team daily for 
individual therapy, and also participating in some group and 
milieu therapy as tolerated. Upon discharge, patient was 
provided with prescriptions for benztropine 1mg po BID, Depakote 
750mg po BID, Vistaril 50mg po BID prn anxiety/insomnia, 
risperidone 3mg po BID, and ziprasidone 80mg po BID.  Patient's 
PACT team was contacted during this hospitalization and again 
prior to discharge to coordinate aftercare.  On discharge, 
patient was sent via ambulance to his PACT team, and patient's 
PACT team case manager planned to meet with patient on each day 
of weekend following discharge.  Patient was also scheduled for 
a follow-up appointment with his PACT team psychiatrist on 
___.  Patient was in good understanding and agreement with 
this aftercare plan.
.
 GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
  #).Chronic tooth pain: Patient did complain of some chronic 
tooth pain, for which he had been taking ibuprofen.  Patient 
remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and demonstrated no 
signs of infection during this hospitalization.  Patient was 
continued on ibuprofen 600mg po q6h prn pain.  Patient should 
continue to follow-up with his PCP and dentist upon discharge 
for ongoing management.
.
 PSYCHOSOCIAL:
 #) GROUPS/MILIEU: Pt was encouraged to participate in unitÂ’s 
groups/milieu/therapy opportunities as appropriate. Patient was 
at times noted to be somewhat intrusive in milieu, but 
ultimately was responsive to staff redirection. He was more 
visible in the unit as the hospitalization progressed, and had 
conversations with peers. He attended groups as tolerated. He 
never engaged in any unsafe behaviors. He ate all meals in the 
milieu, slept well, and cooperated with group rules.
.
 #) COLLATERAL CONTACTS:  Patient's PACT team and PACT team 
psychiatrist, Dr. ___ contacted by the primary 
treatment team for collateral information, and were provided 
with clinical updates on this hospitalization.  PACT team was 
contacted by our social worker prior to discharge in order to 
coordinate aftercare plans.  As detailed above, at time of 
discharge, patient was sent via ambulance to his PACT team, at 
which time PACT team case manager will resume coordinating 
outpatient care.
.
 #) INTERVENTIONS:
 - Medications: risperidone, ziprasidone, Depakote, Vistaril
 - Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and 
milieu therapy.
 - Coordination of aftercare: coordinated in conjunction with 
patient's PACT team as detailed above 
 - Behavioral Interventions (e.g. encouraged DBT skills, ect):  
Patient was encouraged to continue to participate in groups as 
tolerated, with particular emphasis on identifying positive 
coping mechanisms
.
 INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting these medications, and risks  and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to   
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I 
answered the patient's questions. The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.
.  
 RISK ASSESSMENT:
 #) Chronic/Static Risk Factors:
-history of chronic mental illness with many prior 
hospitalizations
-history of numerous failed medication trials, including 
failures on IM depot medications 
  
 #) Modifiable Risk Factors:
-chronic history of medication noncompliance and poor follow-up 
with established aftercare plans
-reported history of self injury and suicide attempts

 #) Protective Factors:
-patient has established outpatient treatment through his PACT 
team
-patient is currently medication compliant
.
 PROGNOSIS:  Overall, patient has a very guarded longterm 
prognosis, given his history of numerous prior hospitalizations, 
numerous failed medication trials, and history of not following 
through with established after care plans.  However, protective 
factors at this point include the fact that the patient has very 
comprehensive, involved outpatient treatment though his PACT 
team, he is currently medication compliant, and upon discharge 
from this hospitalization, he is being sent by ambulance 
directly into the care of his PACT team, who will continue to 
monitor him.  Patient will continue to require longterm 
intensive outpatient follow-up as facilitated via his PACT team, 
in order to help him manage his psychopharmacology regimen, to 
provide him with outpatient therapy, and to help provide him 
with additional outpatient supports in the community.
