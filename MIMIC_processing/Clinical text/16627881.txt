History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mr. ___ is a ___ M with no past medical or 
psychiatric history who presented to the ED with SI with plan to 
overdose in the setting of multiple psychosocial stressors.

On interview, the patient reports that he feels overwhelmed, 
with no one to turn to.  He is acutely aware of the needs of 
others and describes himself as "the person who's always helping 
other people", particularly his family.  He cares for his 
mother, who is chronically ill and currently in a rehab facility 
having recently fallen and sustained a head injury; supports his 
___ year old daughter, who lives with him 5 days out of the week; 
and supports his sister, who has health concerns of her own, as 
well as and his young niece and nephew.  His father died when he 
was ___, and his older brother filled the role of male figure for 
many years, until he himself died when ___ was a teenager.  He 
feels, since then, his family has looked to him as a leader, and 
he has successfully shouldered that responsibility.  Lately, 
however, he has grown to feel that everything has become too 
much, and that the concerns and problems are overwhelming, 
stating "everytime [he] fix[es] one thing there's another thing 
that needs to be fixed".  

Unwilling to be a burden to his family or his friends, he 
"bottle[s] everything up inside", the stress of which 
occasionally causes him to act out:  he reports pushing his now 
ex-girlfriend following an argument, and hitting his nephew out
of frustration.  He says he is not a violent person, but does 
admit to having "anger issues", and although he has been able to 
check his temper for many years, is frightened by this 
intermittent explosiveness.  He says "[he has] a boiling point, 
and when things get to be too much, [he] just blow[s] up."  He 
expresses regret for these actions, and believes he would 
benefit from having someone to talk to outside of his family or 
social circle.

___ questions his purpose in life, concerned that he has lost 
himself consumed by his family's many needs.  He states that he 
is unhappy, and is unsure whether he deserves to be happy.  He 
has intermittently since his break-up under the weight of these 
many stressors begun to hear the voice of the devil in his head 
encouraging him to "end it".  He is not frightened by this 
voice,
and has not, until today, had a desire to act on such impulses.  
He denies that he has had thoughts of suicide prior to today but 
was deeply frightened by his desire to overdose on his mother's 
medications, or to stab himself with a knife.  He cites an 
impulsive suicide attempt following a break-up at the age of ___ 
in which he swallowed a handful of pills, but denies additional
history of self-harm.  He cites his daughter's presence this 
morning as a protective factor against a similarly impulsive 
attempt, and was able to call his sister in order to assist him.

With regard to psychiatric ROS, the patient does endorse poor 
sleep, saying that he often ruminates on his family's concerns 
and "stay[s] up all night" watching TV in an attempt to distract 
himself.  He claims that he never leaves the house, needed to 
care for his mother and his daughter, and states that he no
longer enjoys producing music or spending time with his friends. 
 He endorses a sense of purposeless, as above, but at the same 
time expresses hopefulness, and is optimistic that this 
hospitalization will prove beneficial in that it might connect 
him to a therapist.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the Mr. ___ signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission.  He was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Unspecified Mood Disorder
On presentation, Mr. ___ was irritable, with rapid speech, 
and expressing SI  with plan (placed on red sharps initially) in 
the setting of multiple psychosocial stressors; he desired help 
with feeling so overwhelmed.  His anger and SI dissolved after a 
few hours on the unit, there were no concerns for safety so he 
was transitioned to ___.  He denied depressed mood 
throughout admission, stated his mood was much improved and was 
very grateful for the opportunity to attend groups.  He had good 
insight into his need for ongoing therapy and how not having 
someone to talk to previously was detrimental to his mental 
health.  He was started on oxcarbazepine 150 mg BID due to mood 
instability given his history of having a temper and having 
struck his nephew, ex-girlfriend.  He tolerated this medication 
with no adverse effects so it was increased to 300 mg BID 
(discharge dose).  On discharge, his mood was stable, no SI, and 
he was ready to engage in outpatient therapy/psychiatry 
appointments.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
(From Dr. ___ ___ ED Collateral Note)
Collateral from patient's sister, ___ (___) who 
called ___ on pt:
She states that patient's depression has been going on for much 
longer than the last few weeks. She states this is the "third 
major episode" of patient stating that he was going to kill 
himself in the last year. He has been endorsing feeling 
worthlessness, stating that he doesn't have the support that he 
needs. Things have been very difficult for him and she is in 
100% agreement that patient needs to be admitted inpatient. She 
does not know of any attempts at self-harm. No concerns for any 
episodes of mania. No concerns for substance abuse or alcohol 
use either. She states she has been specifically looking out for 
this and that patient has only been drinking socially.

INFORMED CONSENT
Medication: Trileptal (oxcarbazepine)
Mr. ___ was informed of alternative treatments, the 
consequences of no treatment, and the expected duration of 
treatment. He appeared to appreciate the information conveyed in 
the consent process by asking appropriate questions, which were 
answered by the treatment team, and expressing understanding of 
the potential risks (lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, 
confusion, rash, nausea, vomiting, hyponatremia) and benefits 
(mood stabilization).  The team also discussed the patient's 
right to decide whether to take this medication as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment.  Mr. ___ understood the above and consented to 
begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, Mr. ___ was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon SI with plan to 
overdose on medication or stab self with knife.  His static risk 
factors noted at that time include history of impulsive suicide 
attempt, history of substance abuse (cannabis), male gender, 
single relationship status.  His modifiable risk factors were 
also addressed at that time: his suicidal ideation with 
intent/plan and agitation/irritability dissolved with admission, 
he was assisted in establishing care with outpatient treaters, 
he increased his number of coping skills by attending groups, 
and was assisted with mood stabilization/impulsivity with 
initiation of oxcabazepine.  Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective risk factors, help-seeking 
nature, future-oriented viewpoint, sense of responsibility to 
family, children in the home, life satisfaction, reality testing 
ability, lack of suicidal ideation, no prior self-injurious 
behavior, no access to lethal weapons, and strong social 
supports.  Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at 
this time, Mr. ___ is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others.
