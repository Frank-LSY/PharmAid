History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of ulcerative

The patient reports that she was in her usual state of health

___ in early ___ and saw her PCP, who prescribed a trial of 
buspirone; however, this made her feel unwell and foggy, so it 
was subsequently discontinued. Her Ativan dose was increased 
instead to treat her anxiety.

She subsequently developed unsteady gait, and left facial droop 
and slurred speech. She also reports mental fogginess and 
short-term memory loss. She presented to BID-N for these issues 
on ___, where she had a MRI/MRA of the head and neck that 
revealed small-vessel ischemic disease but no acute process to

was prescribed a course of valacyclovir and prednisone. She 
reports that her facial droop and speech have improved since 
then. However, her gait instability and mental processing issues 
have persisted. She denies any numbness, tingling, or focal 
weakness. She denies fevers or chills. No abdominal pain or

IMAGING:

___ CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

___ ABD U/S
1. No evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.  Mildly 
prominent CBD measures 10 mm, within the upper limits of normal 
given patient's age.  However if elevated liver function tests 
is suggestive of an obstructive etiology, then further 
evaluation with MRCP could be considered.
2. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of ulcerative 
colitis s/p colectomy, anxiety/depression,
recent Bell's palsy who presented with weakness, confusion, and 
___, found to have profound hypothyroidism.

# Hypothyroidism
# Gait instability
# Encephalopathy
Patient presented with several weeks of gait instability, 
encephalopathy, and some  dysarthria. TSH on admission was 111, 
Free T4 <0.1, which may ultimately be the cause of her symptoms 
and further lab abnormalities detailed below. Endocrinology was 
consulted for further management. She began to improve after 
receiving a loading dose of 300 mcg Levothyroxine, continued on 
50 mcg daily maintenance with plan to follow up outpatient in 6 
weeks. Patient had recent MRI/MRA without acute process. 
Neurology was consulted in the ED, initially recommended a 
toxic-metabolic workup (including vitamin B12, folate, Tox 
screen, Treponemal antibodies, blood and urine cultures workup), 
which was unremarkable (apart from ___, then recommended 
patient follow up in Cognitive Neurology Clinic if symptoms do 
not improve with treatment of hypothyroidism. ___ was consulted 
and recommended home with home ___. Patient's daughter/HCP will 
check on patient frequently at her ALF after discharge.

# Acute kidney injury: 
Patient with recent creatinine of 1.3 on ___, 2.6 on admission. 
Improved to ___ s/p 2L IVF in the ED, did not further improve 
with more IVF though urine lytes were consistent with prerenal 
etiology. No evidence of hydronephrosis on ultrasound. Possibly 
some dysfunction related to hypothyroidism vs valtrex (though 
suspect less likely). Please repeat 1 week after discharge and 
if worsening, consider nephrology referral.

# Abnormal LFTs
Also noted on labs prior to hospitalization. Mixed picture with 
mild AST elevation (which could be related to mild CK elevation, 
though this is of unclear etiology). Tbili mildly elevated as 
well but predominantly indirect, which can be seen in 
hypothyroidism. Ultrasound showed no evidence of intrahepatic 
biliary ductal dilation, though CBD
was within the upper limits of normal. Would recheck at 
followup. 

# Thrombocytopenia 
Noted incidentally on routine CBC, no signs of bleeding, please 
repeat at followup. As above, she had mildly elevated indirect 
hyperbilirubinemia. She also had elevated LDH, but no anemia or 
other signs of hemolysis.

# Anxiety/Depression:  Continued citalopram, held lorazepam 
briefly for AMS as above.

# History of breast cancer:  Continued anastrazole

# Hyperlipidemia:  Continued statin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===============
[] Needs repeat CBC, CMP in one week (communicated to patient, 
family, and PCP)
[] If LFTs still abnormal at followup and following an 
obstructive pattern, consider MRCP
[] Nonurgent thyroid ultrasound to assess for nodules
[] Continue Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily, TSH check prior to 
endocrine followup appointment
[] Patient should follow up in Cognitive Neurology Clinic if 
symptoms do not improve with treatment of hypothyroidism
[] Held lorazepam given encephalopathy; could restart if 
improving 
[] Left anterior fascicular block noted on EKG
[] Discharged home with home ___.

>30 minutes spent in coordination of care and discharge planning
