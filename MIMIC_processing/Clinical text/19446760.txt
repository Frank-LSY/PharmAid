Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
Patient failed to void post-op, then was straight cathed. She 
was again unable to void, and Foley was placed, then removed the 
following morning. Patient was voiding independently at time of 
discharge. On the night of POD#1, patent became confused. She 
was found running down the hall and a code purple was called. 
Her confusion and agitation improved after being administered 
Haldol.  On POD#2, the patient was taken off Oxycodone and 
started on Tramadol due to residual confusion.  Urines were also 
collected to check for infection.  Urine studies showed a 
positive urinalysis.  She was started on a 5-day course of 
Cipro.  Her urine culture was pending at time of discharge.  The 
patient will be contacted with the results once back.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1. Drain was removed 
on POD#1.  The surgical dressing was changed and the Silverlon 
dressing was removed on POD#2. The surgical incision was found 
to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. 
The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were 
checked throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly. 
At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular 
diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain 
was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.
