History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of medially
refractory HTN, PRES (___), childhood epilepsy on 
phenobarbital,
who presents with transient, right eye monocular hemi-visual
field loss. 

Ms. ___ reports she was in her usual state of health until
approximately 1:30 ___ on ___, several hours prior to
presentation.  She was at a family ___.  At that time, she
was leaning over a table to set up silverware, and when she
looked up after doing so, she noted that both upper quadrants
acutely went "black" out of her right eye and she lost vision in
those areas specifically. Both lower quadrants had normal 
vision.
She closed either eye and confirmed that it was right eye
monocular loss only.  She did have some floaters at that time,
and intermittently has had them since.  There was no pain, no
headache, no flashing lights, no numbness/tingling, no
difficulties understanding or expressing speech, no weakness. 
She continued to have the field loss for 20 minutes.

Over the next several hours, her visual loss resolved, however
she has had "gray and dark spots" out of the right eye that has
been improving.  She reports feeling about 75% back to normal. 
She was brought to ___, where her
blood pressure was 160/92.  She was transferred to ___ for ophthalmologic evaluation.

At our ED blood pressure is 123/53, vitals otherwise
unremarkable.  Her only complaint at this time the gray and dark
spots out of the right eye field only, improving, as above.

Regarding her neurologic history,:
- ___ years ago she developed PRES in the context of preceding
sepsis.  She was febrile and suffered a pneumonia, for which she
was started on IV antibiotics.  Shortly thereafter, she acutely
developed bilateral vision loss, where the entire visual field 
of
both eyes went completely black.  Her blood pressure at that 
time
was 240/140, she underwent a workup, which revealed that she had
MRI findings consistent with PRES - bilateral T2 white matter
hyperintensities ("predominantly within the posterior 
circulation
indlucing the bilateral parietal and occipital lobes" per ___ report). since then, she has had very mild generalized
blurry vision, described as 97-98% of normal.  She is followed
closely by ophthalmology where she has visual field testing 
every
6 months.  She notes that she has AV nicking from long-standing
hypertension.
-She carries a diagnosis of childhood epilepsy, having had
seizures as an infant. Specifics of her seizure semiologies are
unclear. She has been on phenobarbital 97.2mg daily for many
years. Her last seizure was ___ years ago, when she was
hospitalized with an infection.  

Finally she does have a history of medically refractory HTN, for
which she is on 4 antihypertensive agents (Inderrall, HCTZ,
amlodipine, losartan) and notes that her SBP is usually >150. 
 
On neuro ROS, the pt otherwise denies headache, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

MRI ___
FINDINGS:  
  
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, masses, 
mass effect, 
midline shift or infarction.  No diffusion abnormalities are 
detected.  The 
ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.  
Minimal 
periventricular and a few bilateral deep white matter foci of 
T2/FLAIR signal 
hyperintensity are nonspecific but compatible with minimal 
changes of chronic 
white matter microangiopathy.  The visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoid 
air cells appear clear.  The globes and orbits are within normal 
limits.  
Major intracranial vascular flow voids are preserved. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No acute intracranial abnormality.  No acute infarction. 

CTA ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. No acute intracranial process by unenhanced head CT. 
2. Inferomedially-projecting 1 x 1 mm infundibulum or tiny 
aneurysm arising 
from the distal right A1 ACA. Areas of mild bilateral cavernous 
segment ICA 
luminal narrowing due to calcified atheromatous disease.  
Otherwise, 
unremarkable CTA head. 
3. Calcified plaque causes < 10% luminal narrowing of the 
proximal right ICA 
by NASCET criteria.  Otherwise, unremarkable CTA neck. 
4. 4 mm solid pulmonary nodule at the right lung apex.  
Recommend correlation 
with patient risk factors in consideration of dedicated 
follow-up CT chest 
imaging, as below.  Other incidental findings, as above. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of
medially refractory HTN, PRES (___), childhood epilepsy on
phenobarbital, who presents with transient, right eye 
hemi-visual field loss. History is notable for background of
significant HTN for which she is on four antihypertensives, and
history of PRES ___ years ago. She presents with acute onset of
painless loss of vision in the superior quadrants OD, which
improved over several hours. Neurologic exam notable for no
cranial nerve palsies, normal visual acuity, normal disc margins
with tortuous vessels, no RAPD, normal visual fields at this
time. She was seen by ophthalmology as well who confirmed no
evidence of retinal pathology including no evidence of retinal
tear or retinal detachment, and no signs of vein or artery
occlusion.

Given her underlying vascular risk factors, transient monocular 
visual loss, and right ICA calcified plaque on imaging, the most 
likely diagnosis is TIA.  Giant cell arteritis was considered in 
the differential diagnosis, but was r/o due to lack of pain and 
other associated features such as jaw claudication and normal 
CRP and sed rate. MRI was negative for acute stroke. TTE was 
within normal limits. Patient was started on rosuvastatin for 
hypercholesterolemia (has had elevated LFTs in the past on 
atorvastatin; LFTs normal this admission). Of note, SBP has been 
averaging in 110s this admission off all hypertensives except 
half of her home propranolol dose.

Transitional Issues:
-Follow-up event monitor
-Continue losartan, propranolol; hold amlodipine. Follow up with 
PCP regarding ___ management
-Recheck LFTs in several months

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with symptoms of right eye 
vision loss. You were seen by ophthalmology who did not see any 
signs of retinal tear, detachment, or vein or artery occlusion. 
Your MRI did not show an acute stroke. The imaging of your 
vessels showed that you had some plaque at the junction of where 
your common carotid artery splits into the internal and external 
carotid artery on the right side. This is the most likely source 
of the clot that traveled up to one of the vessels supplying 
your eye to give you your symptoms. We call this a transient 
ischemic attack, or TIA. 

 Stroke/TIA can have many different causes, so we assessed you 
for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having 
stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify 
those risk factors. Your risk factors are:  
 High cholesterol
 Hypertension

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 START rosuvastatin 10mg daily
 STOP taking hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine until your blood 
pressure can be reassessed by your primary care physician as you 
have had lower blood pressures while in the hospital.

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
