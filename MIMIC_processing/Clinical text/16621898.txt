IMAGING:
___ KNEE/TIB/FIB XRAY
FINDINGS:  
The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  No acute 
fracture or 
dislocation is present.  No concerning lytic or sclerotic 
osseous 
abnormalities are seen.  Mild joint space narrowing is noted 
involving the 
patellofemoral compartment.  There is a small superior patellar 
enthesophyte.  
No radiopaque foreign bodies are noted.  There are minimal 
vascular soft 
tissue calcifications. 
IMPRESSION:   
No acute fracture or dislocation. 

___ CXR PA/Lateral
IMPRESSION:   
1. Marked cardiomegaly, increased from the previous study, with 
mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural 
effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right. 
2. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis 
though 
infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
3. Background of mild chronic interstitial abnormality, perhaps 
progressed 
since the previous chest radiograph from ___. 

___ CT Head without contrast
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of acute territorial infarction, 
hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  There is prominence of the 
ventricles and sulci suggestive of 
involutional changes. Periventricular and deep subcortical white 
matter 
hypodensities suggest chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  
Mild 
atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the cavernous 
carotid arteries. 
There is no evidence of fracture.  Mild mucosal thickening is 
seen within the right maxillary sinus.  The visualized portion 
of the remaining paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and 
middle ear cavities are clear.  The visualized portion of the 
orbits are unremarkable.  
IMPRESSION:  
No acute intracranial process. 

___ CT C-spine without contrast
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of acute fracture or traumatic 
malalignment.  No 
prevertebral soft tissue swelling is present.  Mild to moderate 
degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical spine with 
mild anterolisthesis of C6 on C7, intervertebral disc space 
loss, vacuum disc phenomena, and minimal osteophytic spurring.  
No critical central canal stenosis is present.  Facet 
arthropathy and uncovertebral spurring is noted at multiple 
levels resulting in mild left neural foraminal narrowing at 
C5-6.  Of note, there is a 8 mm hypodense lesion within the 
right lobe of the thyroid.  A left pleural effusion is partially 
imaged.  Note is made of biapical scarring within the lungs. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of acute fracture. 
2. Mild to moderate cervical spondylosis with mild C6 on C7 
anterolisthesis, 
felt to be degenerative in etiology. 
3. Left pleural effusion, incompletely imaged. 

MICROBIOLOGY:

DISCHARGE LABS:

___ 05:25AM BLOOD Calcium-8.3* Phos-4.2 Mg-2.___ with afib not on anticoagulation who presented after a fall 
with delirium in the setting of narcotic pain medications.

#Encephalopathy - Likely due to morphine and tramadol received 
at OSH in ___. Improved with holding narcotics. It was 
unclear what tramadol and morphine doses she received, but the 
discharge summary from ___ was requested and will be faxed 
to her PCP's office. No evidence of infection on UA, cultures, 
CXR. At discharge, she was oriented to self and year, as well as 
all her family members. However she does have baseline 
forgetfulness of recent events.

#Frequent falls - Has had 3 falls in the past 3 months, likely 
due to proprioceptive and neuropathic gait dysfunction. Not 
orthostatic and no arrhythmia on tele other than a-fib with 
ventricular rates ___. Her anticoagulation was held and she 
was started on aspirin given frequent falls recently. 

#Afib with rapid ventricular response - CHADSVasc is 4. However 
given her advanced age and frequent falls, bleeding risk may 
outweigh stroke risk. Rate was well-controlled on her home 
metoprolol. Her anticoagulation was held at discharge, and she 
was started on aspirin 81mg daily pending further discussion 
with her PCP and cardiologist.

#Hypertension:  
-continued home metoprolol
-recently stopped amlodipine with goal SBP<150 per outpt records

#Rib fracture: Still had some pain with cough.
-APAP standing
-Incentive spirometry started

#Pseudogout
-chronic, no active flare at present

#Osteoporosis
-continued calcium, vitamin D. Was previously on Fosamax.

#Seborrheic keratosis.  The patient followed up with Dr. ___ Dermatology.  No skin cancer, precancerous lesions or 
dysplastic nevi identified.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Opioids were added to allergy list given acutely altered 
mental status. Please avoid narcotic medications.
- Warfarin was held at discharge given frequent recent falls. 
Please ensure patient has followup with cardiologist Dr. ___ 
___ to discuss anticoagulation for her a-fib in the setting 
of fall risk.
- Please encourage incentive spirometry, getting out of bed and 
ambulation to prevent atelectasis/pneumonia given recent rib 
fractures.
- Please maintain sleep/wake cycle and frequently reorient 
patient to prevent delirium.
- Code status: FULL CODE
- Contact: Daughter (HCP) ___ ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for confusion after getting pain 
medications at an outside hospital.  This is a common effect in 
elderly patients who take narcotic pain medications, and you 
improved after we stopped giving you these medicines.  We also 
checked for a urine infection and pneumonia, and you did not 
have either of these infections.

Please continue to work with physical therapy at your facility, 
which will help your pain.  Please avoid taking any opioid or 
narcotic medications in the future.

Best wishes,
Your ___ Providers
