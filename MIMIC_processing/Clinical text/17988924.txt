Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the ___ Spine Surgery Service on ___

through an anterior approach. Please refer to the dictated 
operative note for further details. The surgery was without 
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a 
stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative 
DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard 
protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 
she returned to the operating room for a scheduled L4-5 
decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 2-part procedure. 
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details. 
The second surgery was also without complication and the patient 
was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. Postoperative 
HCT was low and she was transfused 2 units PRBCs with good 
results. A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at the time 
of the posterior surgery remained in place until postop day one. 
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was 
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain 
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#2 
from the second procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar 
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
