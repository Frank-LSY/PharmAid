On interview, pt readily reported she experienced a manic 
episode prior to arrival to the ED. Pt described feeling like 
she was, "Bouncing," w/ very high energy, moving fast, racing 
thoughts, reduced inhibition, and increased impulsivity. Pt 
stated that she thoughts w/ friends that she usually wouldn't, 
specifically that she has daily thoughts of "passive suicidal 
ideation," that she'd be better off dead. Pt also discussed 
thoughts of wanting to harm her self via cutting w/ exacto knife

increased frequency of intrusive
thoughts to harm herself, via cutting or to hit her head on the 
wall. Pt reported that she did not take actions towards self 
harm this evening. Pt denied past similar episodes. Pt denied 
new or a change in stressors today. 

Pt was asked to account for her day. Pt reported waking up at 
1pm after sleeping x12 hours. Pt then showered and got food by 
herself at a local diner. Pt was invited to a movie, but decided 
not to go and returned to her dorm by herself. Around 7PM pt 
went to her friends place to watch a movie. It was at this time 
that she felt her thoughts and energy markedly change. Her 
friends suggested she return to her room and take her medication 
(Venlafaxine ER), which she did. Today she did not take her 
Adderall, which she is prescribed for fatigue. Pt's friends 
became quite worried about her due to her discussion of wanting 
to harm herself and "passive suicidal ideation," and they 
contacted her RA. Pt was then sent by ambulance to ___ ED for 
further evaluation. Upon arrival to the ED, pt reported feeling
that her manic episode had subsided and her energy decreased. Pt 
denied substance use today and in recent past. Pt denied any 
other impulsive or dangerous behaviors. Pt denied sx of 
psychosis. 

Pt described her mood as, "Down." Pt reported depressed mood for

stressors, noting that she does well in class and has many 
friends. However, pt later discussed ongoing emotional abuse at 
home, and reported returning to school from home 2 weeks prior 
to presentation. Over the past 2 weeks, pt experienced 
disturbance in neurovegetative sx. Pt reported the past 2 weeks 
she felt more depressed than usual, characterized by extreme 
self hate, low
energy, fatigue, and poor sleep (frequent awakenings, x2-3 per 
night). Pt attributed the change in mood to the stress from 
being at home. Pt denied other stressors. Pt reported doing well 
at school, currently taking classes towards earning a degree in 
behavioral neuroscience, and getting all As. Reported skipping 
one class this past week when feeling unmotivated and stress, 
which is unusual for her. Over the past 2 weeks, pt denied 
change
in impulsivity, racing thoughts, activity, sleep, concentration, 
and talkativeness. Pt endorsed recent self harming behaviors, 
specifically cutting her thighs w/ an exacto knife as a way to 
cope w/ anxiety. Pt endorsed suicidal ideation, and denied 
suicidal planning or actions. Pt denied change in suicidal 
ideation, and stated it was longstanding "for years."

mood changes, reported her outlook changes, but denied any

Brief Hospital Course:

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC:
#Depression: Ms. ___ has a long standing self reported 
history of depression who was admitted following an episode of 
elevated mood and egodystonic intrusive thoughts to harm 
herself. On admission to the unit, she was dysthymic, tearful 
and apprehensive about the admission. She does acknowledge a 
history of depressed mood that has acutely worsened in the past 
couple weeks coinciding with restarting school. She noted that 
the intrusive thoughts on ___ were the most concerning to 
her. Prior to admission, she had been taking Venlafaxine 112.5mg 
as an outpatient for about a year. She said that initially she 
felt like it was helping but she no longer felt that way 
anymore.  Given her ongoing symptoms of depression, the team and 
patient decided to try sertraline.  She was cross tapered on 
both medications, initially placed on 50mg at night of 
sertraline and 75mg of Effexor.  The next day she received 
37.5mg of Effexor and 75mg sertraline.  Pt tolerated the 
medication well and denied any symptoms of withdrawal from 
Effexor. She was discharged on 75mg Sertraline. Upon discharge 
pt denied any suicidal or self injurious thoughts. She was 
determined to be safe for discharge on ___. 

Diagnostically, the etiology of her current presentation of mood 
liability is unclear. Ms. ___ does have a longstanding 
history of depression that has been treated with an SSRI with 
limited success. She is expressing neurovegetative symptoms 
making this episode like a current depressive episode of her 
Major Depression Disorder.  The team discussed augmentation of 
her sertraline with Wellbutrin to provide synergystic benefits, 
and the pt was instructed to discuss this with her outpatient 
team. 

#ADHD: Pt reports a history of ADHD treated with Adderall ER 
30mg daily. She said that the Adderall helped her to wake up in 
the morning or else she would sleep for many hours in a day.  
She noted that she only experiences hypersomnia when she is 
depressed.  The team expressed how sleeping too much is likely a 
symptom of her underlying depression and if this were adequately 
treated she may not need the Adderall to give her energy.  She 
expressed that she would like to get off the Adderall. It was 
held while inpatient and she was instructed to follow up with 
her outpatient providers.  It was also suggested that adding 
Wellbutrin could providing some activating benefits as well as 
help with the depression.  She should speak to her providers.
