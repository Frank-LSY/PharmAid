IMAGING: 

___ CTA CHEST 
FINDINGS: The thyroid is normal.  There is no supraclavicular or 
axillary 
lymphadenopathy.  A left paratracheal lymph node is enlarged and 
measures 
approximately 1.8 cm x 2.8 cm, series 3, image 69.  A subcarinal 
lymph node measures 1.2 cm x 1.9 cm, also enlarged.  An enlarged 
right hilar lymph-node measures up to 1.2 cm (2;43. The heart 
size is normal.  Note is made of a small pericardial effusion.  
The esophagus is normal without evidence of wall thickening, or 
a hiatal hernia. 
  
CTA:  A small 4 mm hypodense thrombus is seen eccentrically 
along the superior wall of the left main pulmonary artery 
(series 3 image 76).  The remainder of the lobar, and segmental 
pulmonary arteries are well opacified without evidence of a 
filling defect concerning for a pulmonary embolus.  Evaluation 
of the subsegmental branches is limited due to extensive motion 
artifact.  Pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber.  The aorta 
is unremarkable, normal in caliber without evidence for 
dissection or intramural hematoma. 
  
A 5 mm nodule is seen within the left lung apex (___).  
Diffuse bronchial thickening suggests bronchitis.  No concerning 
focal consolidation is present. Small left pleural effusion is 
seen with adjacent atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
  
The study is not tailored for the evaluation of the 
subdiaphragmatic 
structures.  Bilateral breast prostheses are seen in place.  No 
acute 
intra-abdominal abnormalities are seen.  Incidental note is made 
of a gastric diverticulum in the left upper quadrant. 
  
Osseous structures:  No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for 
malignancy are identified. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Small 4 mm eccentric thrombus seen along the superior wall 
of the left 
main pulmonary artery concerning for a tiny pulmonary embolism.  
No other 
evidence of pulmonary emboli. Evaluation of the subsegmental 
branches is 
limited secondary to extensive motion artifact. 
2.  Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy may be reactive, 
however a 
follow up in 3-months with dedicated chest CT is recommended as 
the 
lymphadenopathy may be due to an underlying neoplastic process. 
3.  A 5 mm nodule is seen within the left lung apex. 
4.  Small left pleural effusion. 
5.  Small pericardial effusion. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow up chest CT in 3-months to reassess 
the mediastinal 
and right hilar lymphadenopathy as well as the 5 mm left apical 
pulmonary 
nodule.

(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

Conclusions   
 The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 
___ mmHg. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function.   
 
___ Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left 
lower extremity 
veins. 
2. Right ___ cyst. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, sarcoidosis 
and HTN presenting with acute onset of chest pain and dyspnea on 
exertion after recent flight from ___. 

#Pulmonary Embolism: On presentation to the ED was found to be 
in sinus tachycardia with rate 111, BP 190/75 with O2 saturation 
99% RA. During ED course was noted to be mildly hypoxic to the 
low ___ on room air, requiring 2L NC. Labs were notable for neg 
trop x2 and BNP 1063 with normal lactate. CTA showed small 4 mm 
eccentric thrombus seen along the superior wall of the left main 
pulmonary artery, small left pleural effusion and small 
pericardial effusion, although due to motion artifact unable to 
visualize all subsegmental arteries. Started on heparin gtt with 
a bolus and was admitted for further management. On arrival to 
the floor, hypoxia had resolved. ECG showed diffuse nonspecific 
ST segment and T wave changes. Given proBNP elevation, obtained 
TTE which showed normal systolic function and no evidence of 
right heart strain. Bilateral lower extremity duplex ultrasound 
showed no evidence of DVT. Her chest pain resolved and she was 
able to ambulate without shortness of breath, lightheadedness, 
dizziness, chest pain, palpitations or hypoxia (ambulating O2 
sat no lower than 95% on RA) and she was transitioned to 
apixaban for anticoagulation with instruction to follow-up with 
PCP right away on return to ___. 

#DOE: Likely related to PE, Trop neg x 2, ECG with nonspecific 
ST-T wave changes making ACS less likely, although history of 
chronic DOE concerning for additional underlying cardiac or 
pulmonary process.  Given mediastinal LAD on CT chest, could be 
related to flare of sarcoidosis, however seems to be a remote 
diagnosis. Prior to discharge, ambulated without dyspnea or 
hypoxia. 

#CKD: Cr 1.2 on presentation, per patient has history of renal 
insufficiency so likely at baseline. Recevied 1L NS and 
maintenance fluids and creatinine remained stable. 

#HTN: Hypertensive to 190/75 on initial presentation. Likely 
secondary to sympathetic response from chest pain, improved with 
pain management. Normotensive on arrival to the floor, so home 
antihypertensives were held. On day of discharge, blood 
pressures trended up to systolic pressure of 150s. Home 
antihypertensives were not formulary, so instructed patient to 
resume home antihypertensives after leaving the hospital.

#History of breast and ovarian cancer: Per patient, history of 
breast cancer (BRCA positive) diagnosed in ___ with recurrence 
in ___ s/p bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy and more recently 
ovarian cancer, diagnosed ___ with history of colectomy, 
hysterectomy and BSO, chemotherapy in the end of ___. Noted on 
CTA to have mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, with 
recommendation for f/u imaging in 3 months to assess for 
underlying recurrence of malignancy. 
 
====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
- Found on CTA chest to have mediastinal and right hilar 
lymphadenopathy which may be reactive, however a follow up in 
3-months with dedicated chest CT is recommended to rule-out 
recurrence of malignancy versus sarcoidosis. Also was noted to 
have a 5 mm nodule within the left lung apex. CD with CTA images 
was provided to the patient on discharge. 
- PE: Discharged on apixaban for anticoagulation, 10mg BID x 7 
days, then 5mg BID ongoing for at least 6 months. Patient given 
30 day supply while in the ___. ___ have been provoked from 
recent international flight, but unclear if underlying 
recurrence of malignancy also contributing. If concern for 
recurrence of malignancy, may benefit from using lovenox for 
anticoagulation. 
- Dyspnea on exertion: Pt endorses DOE for the last year or so, 
sarcoidosis may be contributing given lymphadenopathy seen on 
CTA; if persists and clinically indicated could consider stress 
test, pulmonary function tests to further evaluate

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came into the hospital because you were having chest pain 
and shortness of breath. You had a CAT scan of your chest which 
showed a blood clot in your lungs called a pulmonary embolus so 
you were started on a blood thinner called heparin. Your blood 
tests and EKG showed that the clot may be causing strain on your 
heart, so you had an echocardiogram which was normal. You were 
switched to a different blood thinner called apixaban. It is 
very important that you take this medication every day as 
directed and follow-up with your doctor when you return to 
___ to decide how long you will need to take a blood thinner 
for. For the first week, you need to take a higher dose of 
apixaban (10mg) twice daily. Starting on ___, 
please decrease the dose to 5mg twice daily. If you have any 
bleeding, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, 
dizziness after you leave the hospital you must return to the 
emergency room for evaluation right away. Please follow-up with 
your doctor right away when you return to ___. 

Once you leave the hospital, please take your blood pressure 
medications candesartan and adalat. If you experience 
lightheadedness or dizziness after doing so, please seek medical 
attention. 

It was a pleasure being involved in your care, 
Your ___ Care Team
