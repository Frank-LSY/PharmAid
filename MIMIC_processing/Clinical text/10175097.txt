Brief Hospital Course:
#Non fluent aphasia with right sided weakness: Patient presented 
with acute onset dysphagia followed by dysarthria and right 
sided weakness, and was admitted to Neuroscience ICU for BP 
monitoring post tPA (tPA given at 0010 on ___.  She was 
monitored with q1 hour neurologic checks and BP monitored and 
within ranges per post tPA protocol. Glucose remained well 
controlled. She had significant improvement and resolution of 
her presenting complaints within 24 hours of arrival. Her 
dysarthria and aphasia resolved, and she passed bedside swallow 
evaluation. She was advanced to regular diet on ___ and 
tolerated well.  In terms of her neurologic exam, she did not 
have any focal deficits, apart from mild weakness in distal UE 
and symmetric proximal ___ weakness, increased tone and 
hyperreflexia, which is consistent with patient's cervical 
myelopathy. Her weakness was difficult to assess given 
significant joint pain at baseline from her history of RA.  She 
did not have a clinical exam consistent with stroke given her 
improvement.  She had an MRI performed ___ which revealed no 
acute infarcts or other significant abnormalities on MRI brain. 
It did reveal a small area of left frontal FLAIR hyperintensity 
but this was not felt to be clinically significant. Given upper 
motor neuron signs on exam and concern for cervical myelopathy, 
MRI of cervical ___ was performed which revealed changes of 
cervical spondylosis, with "mild spinal stenosis at C3-4, 
moderate spinal stenosis at C4-5, and mild to moderate spinal 
stenosis at C5-6 level; deformity of the spinal cord by disc 
bulging at C4-5 level with spinal cord  contact by disc bulging 
at C3-4 and C5-6 levels. No abnormal signal within the spinal 
cord." There were no indications for inpatient neurosurgical 
intervention given her exam was back to her baseline. On day of 
discharge (___) patient continued to have clinical improvement, 
and reported feeling back to her baseline. She was ambulated 
around unit without difficulty. She was evaluated by physical 
therapy who felt that she could benefit from outpatient physical 
therapy, which patient was already arranged for via ___ per 
family and case management. Patient was discharged on ___ at 
her baseline condition. No medication changes were made. She was 
given referral to follow up with neurosurgical ___ surgery and 
stroke team after discharge for further workup/evaluation of 
cervical myelopathy.

#HTN: Patient's BP was maintained per post tPA protocol with SBP 
less than 180 and DBP less than 105. Given clinical stability 
over next ___ hours, patient's BP was allowed to autoregulate 
<160 systolic and was well controlled. Patient was resumed on 
home propranolol 60mg daily upon discharge. 

#Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on home statin once 
swallow evaluation was passed.  

#Rheumatoid arthritis: Patient has a history of RA, and reported 
joint pain on arrival but no evidence of acute flair. Her home 
methotrexate was held until she passed swallow evaluation, then 
resumed upon discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
You were admitted to the hospital with difficulty speaking, 
swallowing and muscle weakness. After evaluation by the medical 
teams, there was a concern that these symptoms could be caused 
by a stroke. For this reason, you were given tPA (the "clot 
___ medication, and you were admitted to the ICU for close 
monitoring after receiving this medication. Your symptoms 
improved over 24 hours.  We had an MRI of the brain, which did 
not reveal any evidence of stroke.  You had an MRI of your ___ 
to see if this could explain any of your symptoms. It did show 
narrowing in some areas of the ___, which we recommend you see 
a Neurosurgeon in clinic after you leave the hospital to look 
at.  Finally, you were seen by physical therapy team who felt 
that you could continue to build up strength with outpatient 
physical therapy.
