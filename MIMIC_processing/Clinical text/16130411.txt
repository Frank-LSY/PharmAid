FLOW CYTOMETRY: 
============== 
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Immunophenotyping = Peripheral blood

Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed 
by 
___ ___. ___ 

DIAGNOSIS: 

The following tests (antibodies) were performed: ___, Kappa, 
Lambda, nTdT, cMPO, cCD79a, cCD3, cCD22, and CD antigens 
2,3,4,5,7,8,10,11c,13,14,16,19,20,23,33,34,38,45,56,64,117.

RESULTS:

10-color analysis with linear side scatter vs. CD45 gating is 
used to evaluate blasts.

The viability of the analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD 
is 99.4%. 

Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells 
isolated from this peripheral blood are in the CD45-dim/low 
side-scatter "blast" region. They express immature antigens 
CD34, and myeloid associated antigens CD117, CD13, CD33. A 
subset (~40%) express HLADR, and the blasts have equivocal dim 
subset expression of CD11c, CD11b, CD4, CD64. A subset 
co-express CD56. 

They lack B (cCD79, cCD22), T cell associated (cCD3) antigens, 
are CD10 (cALLa) negative, and are negative for nTdT, cMPO and 
CD14. 

CD34(+) blasts comprise 79% of total analyzed events. 

CD45-bright, low side scatter gated lymphocytes are 8.3% of 
total analyzed events. Of these, ~62% are T-cells that express 
mature T-cell antigens and have a helper-to-cytotoxic ratio of 
1.5. B-cells are ~28% of lymphoid gated events, do not express 
aberrant antigens and appear polytypic. CD56(+), CD3(-) natural 
killer cells are ~5% of lymphoid gated events.

INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by ACUTE 
MYELOID LEUKEMIA. A subset have possible monocytic 
differentiation. Please correlate with morphologic, cytogenetic 
and molecular findings for exact nosologic subclassification.

Note: The Technical component of this test was completed at 
NeoGenomics ___, ___ / ___ / ___ # ___. The 
Professional component of this test was completed at ___ 
___, ___, ___, ___ / ___. This test was 
developed and its performance characteristics determined by 
NeoGenomics Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by 
the ___ Drug Administration. The FDA has determined 
that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is 
used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as 
investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified 
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of ___ 
(CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with history of ovarian cancer s/p TAH BSO + 6 
cycles of ___ in ___ c/b recurrence in ___ s/p 6 
cycles of ___ in remission, who presented with acute 
leukemia. 

#Acute Leukemia: She initially presented to her PCP's office 
with fatigue and fever. She went to ___ and was found to have a 
WBC 15 with 57% blasts, Hct 20, LDH 1198. An attempt was made to 
transfer to ___ but a bed was not available. Upon presentation 
to ___ WBC 12.5, 8% PMN, 71% blasts, Hb 5.8, PLT 21, UA 6.2. 
Patient was admitted to the leukemia service for monitoring. She 
was started on allopurinol ___ daily, maintenance IVF and was 
transfused 2U pRBC and 1 pack platelets. TLS and DIC labs were 
monitored q6hr and remained stable. Decision was made to 
transfer the patient to ___ per patient preference. Flow 
cytometry via peripheral blood was consistent w/ acute leukemia 
likely AML, without auer rods, low concern for APML. Bone marrow 
biopsy was not performed, awaiting transfer per patient 
preference. Labs prior to transfer were WBC 12.7 67% blasts Hgb 
7.1 plt 49, UA 5.3. 

#Neutropenic Fever: Reportedly with fever to 101 at home, temp 
100.4 in the ED. OSH CXR neg. UA unrevealing and no localizing 
symptoms. Blood and urine cultures were sent, with no growth to 
date. Started empirically on vanc/cefepime. On the day of 
transfer febrile to 100.4, repeat blood cx sent. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================== 
- will require bone marrow biopsy for further evaluation of 
acute leukemia
- blood cx, G6PD pending on discharge
- noted to have mild transaminitis the day of transfer (ALT 52, 
AST 66), continue to monitor
- will require baseline echocardiogram pre-chemo

- CODE STATUS: Full code (confirmed)
- CONTACT: ___ (husband): ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It has been a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You presented with fatigue and you

service. You received blood transfusions and platelet 
transfusions as your counts were low. You were monitored closely
