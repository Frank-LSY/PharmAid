Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of mantle cell 
lymphoma and reactive airway disease who presented with a 
pruritic rash for 7 weeks.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
--------------
# Rash:
Patient reported history of initial spider bite 7 weeks ago at 
home in the ___ since then, she has developed a diffuse pruritic 
rash that involves her scalp, torso and extremities, with 
lesions that initially form as blisters, then break or dry up. 
On exam, she had diffuse rash in the described distribution with 
a few tense bullae, many red scaly patches, many with overlying 
eschar. Question of potential mucosal involvement with R eyelid 
lesion and on soft palate, though not concerned for SJS. Concern 
for bullous pemphigoid or potentially paraneoplastic process. 
Dermatology was consulted and performed skin biopsy on an intact 
bullae in the RLE. She was treated with Betamethasone ointment 
to trunk and extremities, Desonide cream to affected areas of 
scalp and face, hydroxyzine prn for pruritis as well as began 
Prednisone 60mg daily (1mg/kg dosing) on ___ due to prelim 
pathology concerning for bullous phemphigoid. Final pathology 
pending on discharge. Patient will have close followup in ___ 
clinic. She will remain on Prednisone until outpatient derm 
evaluation.

# Ocular involvement of rash
# Left eye lesion/?lymphoma:
Dermatology raised concerns for ocular involvement and patient 
underwent full dilated slit lamp exam. Exam of her right eye was 
notable for a small area of skin ulceration adjacent to the 
medial canthus on the right lower eyelid. This is likely of the 
same etiology as her systemic body rash. There was no 
conjunctival or corneal staining to indicate ocular involvement 
of the process. She was prescribed fluorometholone eye ointment 
to the medial right lower eyelid lesion 4 times daily and will 
follow with opthalmology. She was noted to have a salmon colored 
patch appearing lesion of the conjunctiva of her left eye 
concerning for lymphoma. There were no orbital signs to raise 
concern for orbital involvement. Further evaluation by cornea 
specialist for consideration of biopsy to be scheduled for the 
week of discharge.

# Oropharyngeal/oropharengeal plaque
# Odynophagia
Patient presented with odynophagia and cough, with thick white 
posterior pharyngeal exudate. HIV negative. She was treated for 
presumed candidiasis with fluconazole for one day (___). On 
reexamination,lesion was felt to be less consistant with 
candidiasis and fluconazole was discontinued. Pending final 
pathology, further etiologies of this lesion may be explored. 
Please consider ENT evaluation as an outpatient, particularly if 
her rash is bullous phemphigoid as oral involvement would not be 
expected. She started viscous lidocaine before meals and magic 
mouthwash for comfort.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
---------------
# Mantle cell lymphoma
Patient follows with Dr. ___ at ___ for ___. Initially 
diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma in ___, with disease 
recurrence but characterized as slowly progressive disease. She 
has been treated at various points with R-CHOP, 
R-velcade-decadron chemotherapy, rituxan, radiation. She most 
recently completed a course of rituxan ___. She reportedly 
has been maintained on low dose radiation treatment every 9 
months. She most recently received radiation therapy in ___ before travelling to ___. At that time, 
PET ___ showed: interval increase in overall tumor burden, 
new FDG avid lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. She has 
outpatient followup scheduled.

# Asthma: continued albuterol PRN.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
