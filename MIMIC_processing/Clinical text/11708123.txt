IMAGING
=======
CT Head w/o Contrast ___  
IMPRESSION:   
- No acute intracranial abnormality on noncontrast CT head. 
Specifically no intracranial hemorrhage or large territory 
infarct.  
- Small midline parietal scalp hematoma without underlying 
calvarial fracture. 

CT ___ w/o Contrast ___  
IMPRESSION:  
- No acute fracture, malalignment, or prevertebral soft tissue 
edema.  
- Minimally prominent left level 2B 1.2 cm lymph node in long 
axis, which may be reactive in nature. Clinical correlation is 
recommended. Otherwise, no cervical lymphadenopathy by size 
criteria.  

CXR PA/Lat ___  
IMPRESSION:  
- No acute cardiopulmonary process. Fullness of the right 
mediastinal border may reflect mass, lymphadenopathy, or 
ascending aortic aneurysm.  
 
CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ contrast ___  
IMPRESSION:  
1. No acute abnormality within the chest. Mediastinal widening 
seen prior radiograph is attributable to the presence of vessels 
and mediastinal fat. No aortic dissection or aneurysm.  
2. 4 mm right upper lobe nodule, for which a dedicated ___ 
CT in 12 months is recommended if patient has risk factors for 
lung cancer.  
3. Diffusely heterogeneous hepatic parenchyma could be secondary 
to hepatic congestion, for which correlation with LFTs is 
recommended.  
4. Markedly enlarged prostate gland measuring up to 9.2 x 7.7 
cm, likely benign prostatic hypertrophy, with mild bladder wall 
thickening suggestive of chronic bladder outlet obstruction.  
5. Subcentimeter left adrenal nodule, not fully characterized on 
this exam, but statistically likely an adenoma.  

TTE ___   
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated 
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with hx of HTN who presented with 3 days of malaise, 
___ cough, nausea, some diarrhea, and syncope x 2 
found to be flu positive. For his flu, patient was treated with 
Oseltamivir with plan for ___ course (ending ___ given age 
___. Syncope thought to be ___ dehydration given history of 
low PO intake and ___ with high BUN:Cr ratio, and he was treated 
with 3L IVF resuscitation - after which Cr improved. 
___ was held until f/u with PCP given 
hypovolemia. Multiple ECGs in the ED and on the floor were 
unremarkable. Telemetry had no significant events and was 
discontinued after the first night. His last TTE in ___ showed 
normal systolic function without valvular disease. There was low 
concern for valvular disease as cause of syncope so echo was not 
performed while inpatient. CT head, CT ___, and CT torso in 
ED were unremarkable with exception of 4 mm right upper lobe 
nodule and 1.2 cm cervical lymph node, for which a dedicated 
___ CT in 12 months is recommended. 

--------------------
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-------------------- 
- continue Oseltamivir through ___
- f/u PCP within one week
- consider TTE as outpatient
- BP medicine was held during admission and at time of discharge 
given hypovolemia. Please assess whether or not to restart at 
f/u appt with PCP

node (1.2 cm); recommend f/u CT in 12 months
