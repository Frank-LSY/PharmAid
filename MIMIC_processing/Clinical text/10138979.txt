#L2 Fracture
The plan for T2-L4 fusion and L1-L3 laminectomy was discussed 
with the patient who became increasingly agitated with the 
surgeon, nursing, and his girlfriend. He asked about 
non-surgical options, which included strict bed rest for 3 
months. The risk of paralysis with bed rest verses surgery were 
discussed at length with the patient. He refused to have the 
procedure. Urgent MRI was ordered to further assess the injury 
to evaluate need for surgery, patient refused MRI. The patient 
refused to wear C-spine collar. The patient's behavior continued 
to escalate and he became more verbally abusive towards staff 
and his girlfriend, he then began throwing objects. Psych was 
consulted. The patient was given Valium, Dilaudid, and Oxycodone 
to manage agitation and pain. The patient requested transfer to 
___ which was approved by Dr. ___. 

#Psych
Due to increased agitation and patient request psych was 
consulted. They deemed him competent to make his own decisions. 
They recommended keeping pain controlled and allowing comforts 
such as eating to manage agitation. Additionally, they 
recommended a 1:1 sitter to make sure the patient did not get 
out of bed. The patient continued to increase in agitation and 
became more violent. He was put in seclusion and security was 
brought in. An EKG was attempted to establish a QTC, however, 
the patient refused aggressively.
