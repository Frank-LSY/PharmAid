History of Present Illness:
HPI: Dr. ___ is a ___ year old man w/ a PMH of HFrEF (EF 35%)
due to ischemic cardiomyopathy,CAD s/p PCI and repeat PCI due to
restenosis, anteroseptal MI.

He has no history of neurological symptoms and is doing well.
Retired, functions in the community normally. 

He states he was in his usual state of health leading up to
today. He does note that he hit his head on the R temporal area
on an antique cross in his house on ___ or ___, but
there was no loss of consciousness, or bruising at the site,
which he monitored carefully and he did not have any symptoms
following that. 

He notes that at baseline he has low energy and feels drained
with doing anything activity easily and gets sleepy in the
afternoon, he states he thinks this is because his cardiologist
has a low SBP goal for him, with a target of SBP <110. He states
his SBP is usually in the 90-100s. The previous day prior to
presentation, he had felt especially low energy compared to
normal. He states he never measures his blood pressure at home.
He notes that when he woke up this morning, he actually felt
better than he typically does.  He was planning on going to the
___ with his wife and friend today. He ate breakfast normally.
His wife and friend left the house at 10:___n errand.
When they came back around 12:00pm, they noted that Dr. ___
was acting oddly. He was standing next to the breakfast table,
dressed appropriately, and appeared ready to go to the ___. He
stated to them "I know I'm ready, but I don't know where I'm
going." He did not recall that they planned on going to the ___.
They then noted he pulled a pocketwatch out of his pocket and
asked "where did this come from? the time is also not right on
it." He currently states he had put the pocketwatch into his
pocket in order to take to the store to have the battery 
replaced
on his way to the ___. He looked at a book that was on the 
table,
which he had been reading earlier in the morning, and had 
checked
out from the library the day before and asked "What is this
book?" As they were preparing to leave, his friend and wife 
noted
that over a 3 minute period he asked 4 times what the weather 
was
going to be like and whether he should bring an umbrella. His
wife also notes that he seemed like he was in the "twilight 
zone"
and almost seemed like he was sleep walking. She notes his
movements seemed slower globally during this as well. He was
otherwise speaking to them normally. They are not sure whether 
he
recalled more remote events, as they did not discuss anything
pertaining to this. He did have problems with recent events at
the time this occurred, as noted in the examples above. His
friend and wife did not note any repetitive movements, did not
say anything about odd smells or tastes. He did not mention
anything about any visual symptoms at the time.

They got into a Lyft, during the ride, his friend called the
nurse for his cardiologist and mentioned the symptoms he was
having. They advised he present to the ED for evaluation.
Sometime in the ED, he appeared to have improved and was near 
his
baseline mental status. He arrived to triage at 1:45pm, so
sometime within an hour after that he had improved.

When asking Dr. ___ the events, he states that he
remembers after his wife and friend had left the house, getting
ready to go out. He took a shower, got dressed, he states he
remembers them coming back into the house and going to greet
them, after this point, he does not remember events. His next
clear memory was leaving the house. He recalls wondering about 
an
umbrella, but does not recall asking about it multiple times. 
His
wife states that his recollection of events upon leaving the
house are not entirely accurate to what occurred. At the time of
the interview in the ED around 5pm, he feels that he has 
improved
and does not particularly notice any issue anymore. His review 
of
systems is negative as below. He denies any recent emotional
stressors, strenuous physical work recently.

He also notes he is a participant in an aging study (where he
takes batteries of cognitive tests) and is in the normal group
for his age.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital after  you had an episode of 
amnesia for a period of about ___ minutes on ___. You were 
evaluated in the emergency room by neurology and underwent head 
imaging including a CT head/CTA head and neck which did not 
reveal any acute pathology. You were then admitted to the stroke 
neurology service for further evaluation and observation for 
TGA- Transient Global Amnesia. 

While admitted, you underwent an MRI of your brain without 
contrast which did not show any acute pathology such as 
microbleeds, large infarcts, bleeds, tumor, swelling, or 
hippocampal involvement to explain your amnesia. You remained 
stable without further amnestic episodes during your stay. 

You had an episode of lightheadedness and a sensation of 
warmth/heat that corresponded to a 29 beat run of v-tach on 
telemetry. We contacted the EP/Cardiologists here who reviewed 
your telemetry and recommended continuation of 25mg metoprolol 
BID (which you are taking at home). Your cardiologist, Dr. 
___ placing an automatic internal 
defibrillator as primary prevention of cardiac arrest from 
lethal arrhythmia as you are at an increased risk due to your 
cardiomyopathy and it was possible that arrhythmia contributed 
to your episode of TGA.
Your nurse ___ review activity restrictions and care of the 
pacemaker site prior to discharge.
We decreased your Metoprolol to 12.5mg Daily per ___ this 
new prescription was sent electronically to ___ in ___.
If you have any questions related to your admission prior to 
your follow up please call ___ to speak with a 
cardiologist or ___ cardiology NP.
It was a pleasure working with you and we wish you the best in 
health!
