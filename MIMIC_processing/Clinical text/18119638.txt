History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with a PMH of hypertension, who 
presented to ___ with hypertensive urgency and chest 
tightness last night, and was found to have NSTEMI with troponin 
of 3.24. According to the patient he was having some chest 
tightness at home which was mild. He subsequently went 
downstairs to open the door and when he came upstairs his chest 
tightness appears to worsen. He initially thought this could be 
due to the cold however his chest tightness persisted for about 
an hour at which time he decided to come to the hospital by 
ambulance. He had mild headache but no blurred vision or 
diaphoresis. He was also slightly short of breath. No nausea no 
vomiting no weakness in his arm. He was recently started on 
Norvasc but ran out a month ago and did not go for refill. In 
the ED he was noted to have a blood pressure of 230/147. He was 
started on labetalol IV 20 mg and nitro paste. His blood 
pressure improved. His chest tightness has also improved. 
Troponins were initially negative. EKG did show sinus rhythm at 
80 beats per minute with ST depression in the lateral leads 
consistent with possible LVH and a strain pattern. He was 
admitted overnight for blood pressure control, which improved, 
however his troponins rose to 3.24. He was started on heparin 
gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, aspirin 325 mg, and oral labetalol, and 
transferred to ___ cath lab. 

Labs at ___ were notable for initial troponin at 9 ___ on 
___ of <0.01, with subsequent check at 0500 ___ of 3.24. 
Chemistries with Na 143, K 3.8, Cl 103, HCO3 28, BUN 22, Cr 1.3, 
Gluc 101. Ca 8.4, Mg 1.9, Phos 3.9. CBC with WBC 5.0, H/H 
13.4/39.3, PLT 201. Pt 1.11, PTT 30.0. 

He underwent cardiac catheterization with a radial approach, and 
was found to have proximal and mid 80% stenosis of his ___ 
diagonal branch of his LAD, and underwent successful PCI with 
DESx1.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, denies any prior 
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint 
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies 
recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional buttock or 
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CARDIAC CATH (___):
Coronary anatomy
Dominance: Right
*Left Main Coronary Artery
The LMCA is normal.

*Left Anterior Descending
The LAD is normal.
The ___ Diagonal has a proximal 80% stenosis and a mid 80% 
stenosis.

*Circumflex
The Circumflex has mild disease.

* Right Coronary Artery
The RCA has mild diffuse disease.

Impressions:
Successful PCI of single vessel disease involving first diagonal

Post MI care, echo, BP control  

US RENAL ARTERY DOPPLER (___):
FINDINGS:  
The right kidney measures 10.2 cm. The left kidney measures 9.9 
cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stones, or masses bilaterally.  
Normal cortical 
echogenicity and corticomedullary differentiation are seen 
bilaterally. 
  
Renal Doppler:  The right and left intrarenal arteries 
demonstrate sharp 
systolic upstrokes and continuous antegrade diastolic flow.  The 
resistive 
indices of the right intrarenal arteries range from 0.61-0.73.  
The resistive indices on the left range from 0.65-0.72. 
  
Bilaterally, the main renal arteries are patent with normal 
waveforms. The 
peak systolic velocity on the right is 55.5 centimeters/second. 
The peak 
systolic velocity on the left is 42.5 centimeters/second. Main 
renal veins are patent bilaterally with normal waveforms.  Small 
left upper pole renal cyst is incidentally noted. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Normal Doppler examination of the kidneys. 

ECHO (___):
Conclusions   
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the 
mid inferior wall (clip 44). The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 50-55 %) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters ascending aorta and arch are mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with focal 
hypokinesis in an atypical distribution and suggestive of 
possible myocarditis or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Mildly dilated 
thoracic aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve 
morphology.

 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
 The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ 
ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram 
is suggested in ___ years.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. 

You were admitted because you had a heart attack. You underwent 
cardiac catheterization which revealed a blockage in one of your 
coronary arteries. You had 1 stent placed. 

It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. 

You are now on aspirin. You need to take aspirin everyday. If 
you stop taking aspirin, you risk the stent clotting and death. 
Do not stop taking aspirin unless you are told by your 
cardiologist. No other doctor can tell you to stop taking this 
medication. 

You are now on Brillinta (also known as ticagrelor). This 
medication helps keep your stent open. Do not stop taking 
Brillinta unless you are told by your cardiologist. No other 
doctor can tell you to stop taking this medication. 

We wish you all the best, 

Your ___ Cardiology team
