History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with history of recent CVA in ___ 
with residual aphasia and possible ___ anopsia, atrial 
fibrillation on coumadin, HTN, HLD, and diabetes admitted to 
___ on ___ from rehab with concern for altered mental status 
and vision changes. 

Per neurology note, She has prior strokes in the R frontal and L 
occipitoparietal lobes. First stroke was ___ years ago when she 
presented with LUE sensory changes, reportedly no motor 
symptoms. She had a second stroke in ___ at ___ and 
then transferred to ___, where she presented with confusion 
and aphasia, and apparently there was hemorrhagic transformation 
requiring 3 weak hold of Coumadin. She has been on 
anticoagulation for many years, at one point transitioned to 
apixaban, but then returned to ___ after stroke. Reportedly 
recent INRs have been in goal range.

Per family, both stroke episodes were attributed to atrial 
fibrillation (per family) even though she was on anticoagulation 
during both episodes. She went to ___ rehab for 1 month 
after her stroke hospitalization this year and then was 
transitioned to ___ where she is 
residing currently. 

The patient is not able to provide history and so details are 
obtained from family and OMR notes in ED. She was reportedly in 
her usual state of health as recently as ___ per her family 
members who saw her, but this morning she was noted to be acting 
strangely by the assisted living staff. The was found in the 
bathroom with the light off, reportedly confused and having 
trouble seeing and was subsequently transferred to the hospital 
for further evaluation. Her family reports she's had some 
reported vision deficits since her recent CVA, but 
intermittently today seems to have been having trouble noticing 
family members coming in (though on arrival to the floor she has 
noticed family members on both sides of the room and is able to 
observe me talking on her R side). She also hasn't been willing 
to stand up today, even though at baseline she generally moves 
reasonably well with use of a walker. 

Otherwise there  have been no known medical issues over the past 
several days with no reported medication changes. Her appetite 
has been normal and she has not had issues with eating. She has 
reported intermittent diarrhea treated with loperamide, though 
none that the family has heard of recently. As far as I can tell 
in talking with her and her family, there have been no fevers, 
chills, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, shortness of 
breath, nausea, vomiting, weakness, numbness, tingling, myalgias 
or rashes.  Beyond the history above, full ___ ROS is 
otherwise negative.

IMAGING:
CTA Head/Neck: 
Noncontrast head CT: 
1. No intracranial hemorrhage. 
2. Old infarction in posterior right frontal and left parietal 
temporal lobes 
CTA head and neck: 
Patent intracranial and cervical vasculature without aneurysm or 
dissection. 
Final read pending 3D reconstruction. 

Shoulder/Humerus ___: 
There is no fracture or dislocation involving the glenohumeral 
or AC joint. 
There are mild degenerative changes. No suspicious lytic or 
sclerotic lesions 
are identified. No periarticular calcification or ___ 
foreign body is 
seen. 
IMPRESSION:  
Mild degenerative changes involving the right shoulder joint 

Chest ___: 
Lungs are low volume with mild interstitial prominence, is most 
likely 
chronic.  Surgical clips are seen in the left axilla.  
Evaluation for 
underlying nodules is limited.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  
There are no 
pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 

ECG/Telemetry - atrial fibrillation at rate of 85 beats per 
minute, left anterior fascicular block, ___ wave 
changes 

- TTE ___: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
small cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic 
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Minimal aortic stenosis. 
Rhythm is atrial fibrilation. No intracardiac mass/thrombus 
identified.

- EEG ___: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the awake state 
due to frequent attenuation of faster frequencies and subtle 
focal slowing seen broadly in the left hemisphere, maximal in 
the temporal region, suggestive of a focal region of subcortical 
dysfunction nonspecific as to etiology. Additional bursts of 
slowing in the temporal regions bilaterally right more often 
than left suggest independent foci of subcortical dysfunction as 
well. Diffuse slowing and disorganization present in the 
background indicates a superimposed mild diffuse encephalopathy 
nonspecific as to etiology. No epileptiform discharges are seen. 
If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may 
provide additional information.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of recent 
CVA w/ residual expressive aphasia and right hemianopsia, 
AF/warfarin admitted with acute mental status and visual 
changes, possible related to TIA or seizure. Symptoms resolved 
with negative neurology ophthalmology, and medical evaluation. 

# Transient Visual Changes
# Transient Confusion: ___ history was difficult to 
assess for patient's lack of recollection. NCHCT w/o acute 
intracranial pathology. No clear toxic, metabolic, or infectious 
trigger on metabolic/septic evaluation. WBC was mildly elevated, 
but this was noted to be a chronic finding in review of 
patient's outpatient labs with PCP. Neurology and Ophthalmology 
evaluated patient without acute findings. NCHCT negative for 
stroke. Discussed case with outpatient neurologist who requested 
spot EEG. This was consistent with general slowing and 
specifically over the left temporal lobe, c/w prior stroke - no 
epileptiform activity. Digoxin level was noted to be elevated on 
admission at 1.7. Although this may not be causal, digoxin 
decreased to every other day. Mirtazipine, which had been a 
recent additional med, was held. Patients mental status and 
neurologic exam soon returned to baseline, confirmed with 
family. ___ evaluated patient who recommended discharge to rehab. 
Hospital course was reviewed with outpatient neurologist, who 
planned to schedule ___ with patient. 

# Polycythemia: Patient's family reported has a history of 
anemia, however, Hb was consistently over 16 while hospitalized. 
Reviewed prior CBC with PCP - WBC and Hb had been elevated on 
last checks. Polycythemia in woman of this age was unusual, and 
workup attempted, but pt refused abdominal US. Iron panel 
normal. LDH slightly elevated at 300. Recommend outpatient epo 
and imaging if persists. Discussed findings with PCP office who 
said they would plan to follow up at future visits. 

# Hypertension: Continued home lisinopril and carvedilol.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Rated controlled. INR therapeutic on 
admission, although family reports fluctuating level PTA. 
Discussed with Dr ___ continuing warfarin in 
place of DOACs given history of hemorrhagic conversion after 
strokes. As noted above, digoxin level was elevated to 1.7 on 
admission. Dose changed to Q48 with effect. 

# History of CVAx2. Both have occurred while on AC, ___ on 
warfarin, second while on apixaban. ? TIA as above. Notably not 
on aspirin. Home statin continued. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Recommend outpatient neurology with Dr ___.
- Mirtazipine held at discharge, talk to PCP about if/when to 
restart
- Digoxin changed from daily to every other day for level of 
1.7. Recommend rechecking level in the future. Remained rate 
controlled. 
- Please note persistent presence ofpolycythemia ___ 
and while inpatient. Patient refused abdominal imaging. Iron 
panel normal. LDH slightly elevated. Recommend further 
outpatient workup - PCP ___. 

Time spent coordinating discharge > 30 minutes
