STUDIES:
=========
CHEST (PA & LAT)  ___ 
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs reviewed without 
comparison. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours 
are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Streaky 
linear opacity at the left base most likely represents 
atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Minimal left basilar atelectasis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ___ 
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is no mass, 
mass effect, or evidence of acute vascular territorial 
infarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and 
configuration. Incidental note is made of 4-mm rounded 
hyperdensity adjacent to the anterior aspect of the third 
ventricle, just slightly left of midline. There is no fracture. 
Visualized paranasal sinuses are normally aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Possible small 4-mm colloid cyst. MRI could be performed on a 
non- emergent basis to confirm this finding.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  ___ 
FINDINGS: There is no fracture or cervical spine malalignment. 
Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is likely due to 
positioning in collar. Prevertebral and paraspinal soft tissues 
are unremarkable. The visualized outline of the thecal sac 
appears unremarkable, but please note that CT is unable to 
provide intrathecal detail comparable to MRI.
IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y.o. F with Down's syndrome admitted after a 
witnessed syncopal episode.

# Syncope: Most likely vasovagal etiology as patient endorsed 
feeling quite warm prior to episode and was outside in hot 
weather without taking in more liquids. Orthostatics x 1 
negative. CE x 2, no tele events, so less likely etiology; 
however, as she has Down's syndrome, she is at increased risk 
from cardiac disease.  Children's Hospital records were 
obtained, and echo from ___ was reported to be negative.  It 
was felt that she could have outpatient followup and an 
outpatient echo for monitoring by her primary pediatrician.  

# Head trauma: CT head was negative for intracranial pathology.
