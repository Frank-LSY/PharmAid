Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY: 
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. She was also placed on q5 minute 
checks status on admission secondary to urge for cutting and was 
changed to q15 minute checks on ___ after improvement in 
SI/SIB, and remained on that level of observation throughout 
while being unit restricted. She was initially placed on red 
sharps status, but was switched to green sharps status on 
___. She did not require physical or chemical restraints 
during his hospitalization. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
Upon admission, the patient reported several weeks of worsening 
depressive symptoms including low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, 
anergia, fluctuations in appetite, decreased 
motivation/concentration, and SI with plan to hang herself. The 
patient purchased a rope and was practicing tying a noose. She 
had additionally resumed SIB in the form of superficial cutting 
after several years of abstinence (in rib cage and inner 
thighs-multiple healed superficial cuts visible). MSE was 
notable for casually groomed age-appearing female with good 
hygiene, affect dysphoric and tearful, thought process linear 
and logical, and content positive for ongoing SI with plan.  The 
patient's diagnosis, given absence of past or present manic or 
psychotic symptoms with negative family history, was most 
consistent with MDD, recurrent, moderate with history of PTSD 
secondary to emotional abuse from her father who had very 
restrictive and punitive upbringing. 

The patient was started on Zoloft 25 mg daily for depression and 
mood stability and Ramelteon 8 mg QHS as she experienced 
difficulty sleeping in a hospital. During hospitalization, 
patient continued to endorse feelings of SI and urges for 
cutting, so Zoloft was increased to 50 mg daily and Lamictal 25 
mg daily was added for impulsivity. These were uptitrated to 
Zoloft 75 mg daily and Lamictal 50 mg QHS. The patient tolerated 
changes in medications well and found them to be helpful for her 
mood and sleep. With time, patient's mood stabilized. She 
learned new coping skills in therapy, DBT skills, which she 
found helpful. The suicidal thoughts gradually faded away. 
Towards the end of hospitalization, patient denied having any 
SI. She was pleasant, cooperative, and engaging at all times, 
motivated to attend groups, no angry outbursts. 

At time of discharge, patient endorsed no more SI or urge to 
cut.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for,

starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team.  

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon suicidal ideation 
with plan.  Her static factors noted at that time include 
history of self harm (cutting), history of trauma, Caucasian 
race, age, marital status (single).  Her modifiable risk factors 
included suicidal ideation with plan, limited insight, lack of 
engagement with outpatient treatment, hopelessness, limited 
coping skills, no established outpatient treatment, active 
substance abuse (alcohol). The modifiable risk factors were 
addressed during hospitalization via medication management, 
psychotherapeutic intervention, and aftercare coordination.  
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including help-seeking nature, future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, life satisfaction, 
reality testing ability, and strong social supports.  Overall, 
the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others.
