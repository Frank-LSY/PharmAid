 Mr. ___ is a ___ male with factor V Leiden s/p

who presents for abdominal/chest pain found to have very large
pancreatic cyst (?walled-off necrosis vs. pseudocyst).

Patient was initially admitted to ___ and ___ for pancreatitis in late ___. He was
discharged to home, doing well for a few weeks, however suddenly
developed chest pain and finger numbness two days ago. He was
very concerned he was having a heart attack, therefore he called
EMS and was taken to ___ for cardiac evaluation. EKG
and troponins there negative for cardiac cause of his symptoms.
He ended up getting a RUQUS, CT abdomen/pelvis and chest x-ray
that were notable for very large fluid collection in pancreas 
(17
by 16.5 by 5.5 cm). Also w/ intra- and extra-hepatic duct 
biliary
dilation (mild). Labs there w/ Tbili 1.4, AST 140, ALT 41, alk

RUQUS:
1. Extrahepatic biliary dilatation and mild intrahepatic duct
biliary dilatation, findings which could be related to extrinsic
compression, although the possibility of obstructing 
intraluminal
sludge/stones is not excluded.
2. Gallbladder sludge and possible tiny gallstones. No
gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic stranding.  

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
1. Most of the pancreas is replaced by an encapsulated fluid
collection measuring 17 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm consistent with late
sequela pancreatitis.. The presence of fat within the collection
could indicate a walled off necrosis rather than pseudocyst.
Correlation with prior imaging suggested.
2. Moderate dilatation of the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile
ducts, which may be related to distortion of the ampulla and
distal duct by the pancreatic collection.

CXR:
No acute pulmonary infiltrates

 
Brief Hospital Course:
 Mr. ___ is a ___ male with factor V
Leiden s/p multiple DVTs on coumadin, and recent pancreatitis in
___, who presents for abdominal/chest pain found to have
very large pancreatic cyst (?walled-off necrosis vs. 
pseudocyst).
He was admitted for pain control and possible intervention of
fluid collection.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:

#Prior acute pancreatitis:
#Pancreatic fluid collection:
#Chest/upper abdominal discomfort:
Per GI possibly either walled-off necrosis vs. pancreatic
pseudocyst.
-no need for pain meds currently per patient, currently pain 
free
-ERCP team following-impression (WOPN vs pseudocyst) causing 
obstructive symptoms
and compression of the CBD. 
-LFTs trended down and stable
-patient tolerating diet and no pain currently
-There is plan to review case at ___ on ___ to further 
delineate
cyst characteristics - WOPN vs pseudocyst. Pending results of
___, ERCP team will plan for potential cyst gastrostomy as an 
outpatient.
-INR will need to be <1.5 for procedure. 
-Plan to hold coumaidn till decision made about drainage, 
patient anf fmailt aware of the plan
-given no. for advance endoscopy
-surgery team also evaluated the patient- no acute need
for surgical intervention

Patient requested discharge and further intervention planned as 
an outpatient

OSH records revealed normal EKG and 2 trops were negative and 
ACS was ruled out

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:

#Factor V Leiden:
#History of DVTs:
-Coumadin on hold currently for possible intervention
-has a monitor at home
-DVt were in ___, h/o IVC filter and never did bridging at home 
previously and Coumadin held for procedures before

#Low phos: RESOLVED
- look for alternative to current home phos repletion due to
difficulty tolerating this

# Contacts/HCP/Surrogate and Communication: wife ___
___ or ___

# Code Status/Advance Care Planning: FULL
