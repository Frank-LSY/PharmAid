Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a right distal tib-fib fracture and was admitted to the 
orthopedic surgery service. The patient was treated 
nonoperatively in a right lower extremity cast and worked with 
physical therapy who determined that discharge to rehab was 
appropriate. The patient was given anticoagulation per routine, 
and the patient's home medications were continued throughout 
this hospitalization.  On hospital day 4 the patient's 
hematocrit was noted to be 23.9, and 1 unit of packed red blood 
cells were transfused.  The patient remained clinically 
asymptomatic for anemia.  There was suspected that the patient's 
anemia may have been due to some bleeding from the fracture 
site.  At the time of discharge, the patient's hematocrit 
appears to be stable.  The ___ hospital course was 
otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, and the patient was voiding/moving bowels 
spontaneously. The patient is nonweightbearing in the right 
lower extremity, and will be discharged on aspirin 325 mg daily 
for 4 weeks for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will follow up with 
Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was had with 
the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected post-discharge 
course including reasons to call the office or return to the 
hospital, and all questions were answered. The patient was also 
given written instructions concerning precautionary instructions 
and the appropriate follow-up care. The patient expressed 
readiness for discharge.

your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.
