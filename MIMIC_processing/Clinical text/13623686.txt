2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Major depressive disorder
On initial presentation to the inpatient unit, patient endorsed 
attempted suicide by venlafaxine, lorazepam, and ibuprofen. 
Stated that she recently started venlafaxine, and additionally 
also recently started a new type of birth control that she felt 
was making her more depressed and tearful. Endorsed several 
psychosocial stressors, most predominantly difficulty in a 
romantic relationship. She endorsed depressed mood and chronic 
suicidality; however, denied any suicidal intent or plan. Was 
able to contract for safety on the unit, and stated that she 
felt fortunate to be alive.
During her admission, her venlafaxine XR dose was increased from 
225mg PO QD to 300mg PO QD to increase norepinephrine activity 
in the setting of her depressed mood and neurovegetative 
symptoms. She was kept on lorazepam 1mg PO QHS and 0.5mg PO BID 
PRN anxiety/insomnia in order to avoid initial activation that 
she described in previous venalafaxine dose escalations. She was 
engaged in individual, group, and milieu therapy. She had 
visitors from her friends, and remained pleasant and 
interactive. 
On discharge, patient endorses "better" mood, and denies any 
suicidal thought, intention, or plan. States that she believes 
she benefitted from taking time out on the unit to reflect on 
the importance of her not being with her present partner. She 
plans to return home to her job as a ___.

vaginal bleeding since abortion in ___, at which point she 
states an implantable (r. arm) form of

lability to this.
-Patient to follow up with her ob/gyn to discuss other birth 
control options

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patientÂ’s primary team met with her daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Collateral was obtained in the ED from patient's friend, as 
above. Additionally, patient's outpatient therapist ___ 
___ (___) and psychiatrist Dr. ___ 
(___) were notified upon the patient's discharge.

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: increased venlafaxine ER dose to 300mg PO QD
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: coordinated follow-up appointments 
with outpatient providers and provided referral information to 
partial programs, intensive outpatient programs, and weekly

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based on impulsive suicide 
attempt. Their static factors noted at that time included 
history of suicide attempts, history of abuse, chronic mental 
illness, Caucasian race, age, marital status, and impulsivity. 
There were also several modifiable risk factors, including major 
mood episode, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, agitation, 
recklessness, social withdrawal, polarized thinking, and recent 
relationship loss. These modifiable risk factors were addressed 
by increasing her venlafaxine dose, encouraging her to engage 
her support system, providing individual, group, and milieu 
therapy, and providing a list of referrals to intensive 
outpatient and partial hospital programs.  Finally, the patient 
is being discharged with many protective risk factors, including 
good connection to outpatient treaters, medication adherence, 
strong social supports, and future-orientation with plan to 
return to her job as a ___. Overall, based on the totality of 
our assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. Our Prognosis 
of this patient is good, due to the patient's aforementioned 
modified risk factors and protective factors.
