a serious suicide note to his wife, which lead to his admission, 
after his wife and therapist agreed that he was no longer safe 
at ___. We discontinued his sertraline, to which his depression 
was refractory, and began duloxetine. We impressed upon the 
patient our opinion that relief of his depression would be 
highly contingent on the cessation of his ethanol use, but the 
patient expressed doubt that he would be able to stop drinking 
and showed limited motivation to do so. We encouraged the 
patient to follow up with outpatient psychiatry and therapy, to 
engage in substance dependence treatment to minimize his chances 
of alcohol relapse and exacerbation of his depressive disorder,

contingent on the cessation of his ethanol use, but the patient 
expressed doubt that he would be able to stop drinking and 
showed limited motivation to do so. We encouraged the patient to 
follow up with outpatient psychiatry and therapy, to engage in 
substance dependence treatment to minimize his chances of 
alcohol relapse and exacerbation of his depressive disorder, and 
encouraged him to remain adherent to his medications. We asked 
that he stay on our unit for treatment of depression and for 
help with alcohol abstinence, until such time as a

him, but the patient elected to sign himself out on ___

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
presence of a suicide note, depressive symptoms, and active 
alcohol abuse and dependence.  Their static factors noted at 
that time include history of chronic depression, history of 
substance abuse, male gender, Caucasian race, age, the presence 
of a concurrent maladaptive narcissistic personality traits.  
The modifiable risk factors were also addressed at that time by 
initiated new medication treatment, encouraging compliance, 
discussing alcohol abstinence and prescribing naltrexone, 
referring patient to AA and encouraging residential substance 
treatment, encouraging engagement with outpatient treatment 
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
factors listed below. Overall, ***Based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is very guarded. 

MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
**suicidal ideation without intent/plan, medication 
noncompliance, lack of engagement with outpatient treatment, 
hopelessness, social withdrawal, limited social supports, 
limited coping skills, lack of purpose, active substance 
abuse/intoxication, recent job loss. 

PROTECTIVE RISK FACTORS
 ***children in the home, reality testing ability, no history of 
abuse, strong social support from wife.  Thus, I feel the
