Interventional Details
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) was performed on a
planned basis based on coronary angiographic findings documented 
on a prior angiogram. Angiography
Name: ___ MRN: ___ Study Date: ___ 13:25:42 
p. ___
confirmed 80% proximal LAD and 80% ostial RCA stenosis.A 6 
___ JCL 3.5 guide provided good
support. A Prowater wire was advanded to distal LAD. Lesion 
predilated with 2.5 a 8mm balloon at 8
ATM. A 3.0 x 12 mm DES was deployed at 14 ATM. The stent was 
post-dilated with 3.25 x 8 mm NC
ballono at ___ ATM. Final angio showed 0% residual, TIMI 3 and 
no dissection. Next a AR1 guide
was used to enage the RCA and provided good support. A Prowater 
wire was advanced to distal RCA.
The ostium was predilated with 3.0 balloon at 16 ATM. A 3.5 x 20 
mm DES was deployed at 16 ATM to
just cover the ostium and th eproximal disease. The stent was 
post-dilated with 3.75 x 15 NC balloon at
16 ATM and the ostium was post-dilated wih t 4.0 x 15 NC balloon 
at 20 ATM. Final angio showed
~10% residual at teh ostium, TIMI 3 flow and no dissection.
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.
Findings
 Two vessel coronary artery disease.
 Successful PCI with drug-eluting stent of the LAD coronary 
artery. Successful PCI with drugeluting
stent of the RCA coronary artery.
Recommendations
 ASA 81mg per day indefinitely.
 Plavix 75mg/day for 12 months
 Secondary prevention of CAD

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
It was a privilege caring for you at ___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You experienced chest pain that was believed to be due to an 
NSTEMI (non ST-elevation myocardial infarction) which is a heart 
attack. 

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You underwent cardiac catheterization to better examine if any 
of your heart's blood vessels were narrowed or occluded as well 
as an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound based exam that 
visualizes the performance of heart muscle. The procedure showed 
that you had blockages in two major vessels that supply blood to 
your heart. We did a repeat cath to put in a stent into the two 
blockages. You tolerated the procedure well.  
- You also received several medications to optimize your heart 
health in the setting of your heart attack and will be going 
home carvedilol, atorvastatin, aspirin, and lisinopril. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
-Please continue to take all of your medications and follow-up 
with your appointments as listed below. You have a follow up 
with your primary care doctor on ___. We offered to set you 
up with a cardiologist here at ___, but you shared that it 
would be more convenient to find one where you live. Your PCP 
can refer you to a cardiologist after your first appointment.
- Please take your aspirin, atorvastatin, Lisinopril and 
carvedilol everyday. These medications decerase the risk of 
future heart attacks and improve heart function. Please take 
your clopidogrel everyday. Missing even one dose of this 
medication can cause a fatal heart attack.   
-If you experience any of the danger signs listed below, please 
contact your primary care provider or go to the emergency 
department immediately. 

We wish you the best!  

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Team
