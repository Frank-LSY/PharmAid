MRI ___
1. Late acute infarct in the left insula. 
2. Evolving subacute infarction in the left precentral gyrus, 
without 
associated intracranial hemorrhage. 
3. Diffuse parenchymal volume loss with probable chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease, as above.

CAROTID ULTRASOUND ___
Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid 
arteries. 
  
TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with basal inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. 
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial 
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad.
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the hospital with acute onset 
aphasia. NIHSS was 3. He was eventually found to have an infarct 
in the left insula and precentral gyrus on MRI, with notable 
language deficits (Broca aphasia) with subsequent improvement. 
The most likely etiology was felt to be cardioembolic from 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, especially considering the 
possibility of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, or 
atheroembolic (artery-to-artery) from what appeared to be a left 
distal M1 stenosis on MRA. We considered further 
characterization of the possible M1 stenosis with a CTA; 
however, the patient and the family declined given solitary 
kidney and underlying chronic kidney disease. Therefore, the 
decision was made to start him on dual antiplatelet therapy and 
maximum dose atorvastatin per the SAMPRISS trial, while 
continuing to work him up for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A 
transthoracic echo did not show any evidence of intracardiac 
thrombus. Carotid ultrasound showed less than 40% stenosis 
bilaterally. He was discharged with Holter monitoring.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

We are changing your medications as follows:
<>
Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
