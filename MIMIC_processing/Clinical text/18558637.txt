PERTINENT IMAGING:
==================

OSH Colonoscopy (___):
The endoscope was passed with ease through the anus under direct
visualization; it was advanced to the terminal ileum. The scope
was withdrawn and the mucosa was carefully examined. The quality
of the preparation was excellent. The views were excellent. 
There
was evidence of moderately severe colitis throughout the colon.
The cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon,
sigmoid colon all had patches of deep ulcerations with inflamed
tissue at the margins. There were also patches of erythema. The
rectum had erythema and friability, but none of these deeper
ulcerations. Multiple biopsies were taken from the cecum,
ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid
colon, and rectum. Otherwise, the colon appeared to be normal. 

OSH PATHOLOGY:  
A. Colon, cecum, cecum, ascending, biopsy: Active cryptitis and
crypt abscesses with surface erosion and increased chronic
inflammatory cells. No dysplasia and no carcinoma seen.
B. Colon, transverse biopsy:
Active cryptitis and crypt abscesses with surface erosion and
increased chronic inflammation.
C. Colon, Descending, Descending, Sigmoid, Biopsy:
Active cryptitis and crypt abscesses with increased chronic
inflammatory cells. 
D. Focal active colitis and surface hyperplastic change. No
dysplasia and no carcinoma seen.

___ ___ L
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins. 

___ MRE
Findings likely reflective of descending colitis/proctitis.  
Small bowel 
appears unremarkable.  Constellation of findings may reflect an 
infectious 
colitis or inflammatory colitis.  No perianal fistulas 
identified. 

___ Right anterior thigh skin biopsy
Sections show dermal areas of necrobiosis with surrounding 
histiocytes consistent with palisading granulomas and foci 
showing interstitial histiocytes. There are separate areas 
showing numerous neutrophils. The combination of findings are 
best classified as a palisaded and neutrophilic granulomatous 
dermatitis (PNGD). Some authors include this diagnosis under the 
term interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. This histopathologic 
pattern may be associated with a number of underlying systemic 
processes including collagen vascular, infections, and tumors. 
While rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus are the more 
common associations; there are rare reports of PNGD associated 
with Crohn's disease. Special stains ___, AFB, Gram, GMS, and 
PAS) are negative for organisms. There is minimal increased 
mucin with alcian blue stain.

Quant Gold pending
 
Brief Hospital Course:
##Likely Crohn's disease 
Presenting with diarrhea, joint pain, and weight loss over the 
past 6 months most consistent with a new diagnosis of colonic 
Crohn's disease with extraintestinal manifestations. GI followed 
throughout admission. Symptoms improved on IV steroids and CRP 
downtrended. Transitioning to PO prednisone for discharge today. 
Will need to be initiated on anti-TNF as an outpatient for 
maintenance therapy. Also treated with empiric cipro/flagyl 
during admission. Quant gold pending.

##Transaminitis
LFTs have been persistently elevated during her hospitalization 
with ALT/AST in the 100-200s and AP around 170s. Tbili normal. 
Unclear etiology, although given association of PSC with 
inflammatory bowel disease will plan for further imaging with 
MRCP as outpatient. Hepatitis serologies negative. Elevated 
prior to initiation of steroids. Possibly with underlying NAFLD. 
Sent full workup of labs prior to discharge ___, IgG, 
AMA, IgM, ferritin, Fe, TIBC, Vit D), results pending.

##LLE swelling 
Left lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT. Improved on 
steroids.

## Skin rash 
Dermatology followed during admission, thought to be 
extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's. Improved on oral 
steroids. Skin biopsy showing palisaded and neutrophilic 
granulomatous dermatitis. Outpatient dermatology follow up 
scheduled.

Transitional issues:
- MRCP as outpatient to evaluate for PSC or steatosis
- Will need LFT check with PCP at visit in one week
- Prednisone taper on discharge
- Patient instructed to start taking calcium and vitamin D on 
discharge
