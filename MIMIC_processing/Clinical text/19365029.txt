___ Imaging LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US     ___. 
FINDINGS:  
  
LIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The 
contour of the 
liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. The main portal 
vein is patent 
with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites. 
  
BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation.  The 
common bile duct 
is enlarged, measuring up to 1.2 cm.  The distal CBD is not well 
evaluated due 
to overlying bowel contents. 
  
GALLBLADDER: There is gallbladder sludge with a thickened and 
edematous wall, 
measuring up to 7 mm.  There are no shadowing stones identified. 
 The 
gallbladder is moderately distended 
  
PANCREAS: The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within 
normal limits, 
without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of 
the pancreatic 
tail obscured by overlying bowel gas. 
  
KIDNEYS:  Limited views of the right kidney show no 
hydronephrosis. 
  
RETROPERITONEUM:  The visualized portions of aorta and IVC are 
within normal 
limits. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Moderately distended gallbladder with a thickened and edematous 
wall and 
gallbladder sludge.  Recommend clinical correlation for acute 
cholecystitis. 
  
Enlarged CBD, measuring up to 1.2 cm.  The distal CBD is not 
well evaluated 
due to overlying bowel.

ERCP ___ @ ___

Impression: 
The scout film was normal. 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
A filling defects consistent with a stone was identified in the 
CBD. 
Opacification of the gallbladder was incomplete. The left and 
right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches were normal.
 A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. There 
was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
The biliary tree was swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting at 
the bifurcation. 
An 8mm stone and sludge were removed. 
The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones 
were seen. 
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: 
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated
Return to ward under ongoing care.
Continue with antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 5 days.

gallbladder wall, no radiopaque stones, which was consistent 
with CT finding at OSH. He was given zosyn. ERCP was done that 
evening (___) with sphincterotomy and removal of 8mm stone. 
After the procedure, he was put on PO ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 
5 days. He was initially kept NPO, and diet was advanced the 
following day. He remained afebrile, without nausea, vomiting, 
or abdominal pain. However, labs revealed a worsened bilirubin 
to 6.2 from 4.0, despite improving AST, ALT, and alk phos (77, 
79, 367 from 103, 123, 411). For this reason, it was recommended 
that he have follow up appointment 2 days after discharge to 
repeat LFTs.
