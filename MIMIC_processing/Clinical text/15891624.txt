History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a ___ with h/o fistulotomy (rectal) and kidney 
stone who p/w CBD obstruction and concern for acute 
cholecystitis, now s/p ERCP and found to have cholangitis 

He initially presented to ___ with acute 
epigastric pain. Pain started at 6am, acute ___ epigastric 
pain with radiation to the ___. Sharp, stabbing pain worse with 
movement, better with rest. Felt like past kidney stones. Drove 
himself to the ED. CT A/P was suspicious for acute 
cholecystitis, for which ___ ultrasound was done which showed: 
thickened GB wall with gallstones and sludge compatible 
cholecystitis. 8mm common bile duct with sludge and stones in 
the distal common duct. He was transferred here per the request 
of the on call surgery team for possible ERCP. LFTs initially 
ALT 98, AST 207, Lipase 27, TB 0.8, direct 0.4. Received 1x dose 
of Zosyn at OSH. 

In the ED at ___, he was in ___ pain without movement, ___ 
with movement. Pain is epigastric with ___ radiation. 1x emesis 
in room, non bloody non bilious. ROS negative for CP, headache, 
fevers, chills, SOB, constipation diarrhea. Last BM was this AM. 


- Initial Vitals: 98, 170/84, 52, 16, 100 RA. Repeat LFTs showed 
significant worsening in ALT/AST, and elevated lipase as well. 
He went to ___:

There:
Scout film was normal 
Major papilla was normal.  
Initial biliary cannulation using sphincterotom was very 
difficult due to unstable scope position.
Pancreatic duct cannulation was achieved and pancreatic duct 
stent was placed
Post pancreatic stent placement multiple attempts to cannulate 
the CBD were performed using sphincterotom but cannulation was 
still not achieved.
Small precut over the pancreatic stent was performed and 
biliary cannulation was achieved. 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification. 
The procedure was highly difficult.
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left 
hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct were filled with 
contrast and well visualized. 
The course and caliber of the structures are normal with no 
evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities
Small filling defects were noted and sludge and pus were 
removed using balloon sweeps. 
Due to the large amount of sludge and pus a decision to place a 
biliary stent was made
During the procedure a technical problem with the stent pushing 
system occurred. 
During the cholangiogram a 1 mm radiopaque material was noted 
at the level of the CBD, most probably detached from the 
malfunctioning stent pushing system
Despite repeat balloon sweeps removal of this material was not 
achieved and a biliary plastic stent was placed.  
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 
Currently, he is still sleepy from sedation, but awake and 
alert, essentially asymptomatic

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of kidney 
stones admitted ___ with choledocholithiasis with 
obstruction, cholangitis, status post ERCP ___, slowly 
improving LFTs.

# Choledocholithiasis with obstruction / cholangitis - patient 
presented with acute onset abdominal pain and jaundice, found to 
have markedly elevated LFTs; patient subsequently ERCP on 
___ demonstrating CBD stone, sludge and pus, prompting 
plastic stent placement.  Patient subsequently with rapidly 
improving clinical exam, but with slowly improving LFTs.  
Patient seen by general surgery who recommended 
cholecystectomy--on ___ patient underwent cholecystectomy with 
general surgery team (see below for postoperative course).  
Continued post-ERCP antibiotic prophylaxis with PO 
ciprofloxacin.  Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent pull 
and re-evaluation.

# Concern for Acute Cholecystitis - per imaging at ___ 
there was concern for gallbladder well thickening; however, 
post-ERCP, patient with remarkably benign clinical exam, no 
tenderness, nausea of peritoneal signs.  Clinically patient not 
felt to have acute cholecystitis.  He was seen by surgery and, 
for the reasons above, underwent cholecystectomy.

He was taken to the operating room on ___ and underwent a 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Please see operative report for 
details of this procedure. He tolerated the procedure well and 
was extubated upon completion. He was subsequently taken to the 
PACU for recovery.

The patient was transferred to the surgical floor 
hemodynamically stable. His vital signs were routinely monitored 
and he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was 
given a regular diet postoperatively, which he tolerated without 
abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He was voiding adequate 
amounts of urine without difficulty. He was encouraged to 
mobilize out of bed and ambulate as tolerated, which he was able 
to do independently. His pain level was routinely assessed and 
well controlled at discharge with an oral regimen as needed. On 
___, he was discharged home with instructions to ___ 
in the Acute Care Surgery clinic in ___ weeks, and the ___ 
clinic in 4 weeks.

# Retained foreign body - per ERCP report, "During the 
cholangiogram a 1 mm radiopaque material was noted at the level 
of the CBD, most probably detached from the malfunctioning stent 
pushing system"; discussed with ERCP today--patient is aware.  
No additional management necessary per ERCP. The patient was 
instructed to ___ with the ___ clinic 4 weeks after 
discharge.

# Elevation in Lipase - patient incidentally found to have 
elevated lipase to > 585 in setting of above pain and 
Choledocholithiasis with obstruction.  Following ERCP, pain 
rapidly resolved and lipase downtrended.  Clinically he was not 
felt to have acute pancreatitis--lipase felt to be nonspecific.  


Transitional Issues
- Will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent pull and 
re-evaluation
- Consider LFT check at PCP ___ to ensure normalization

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with an infected gallbladder and obstruction 
of your common bile duct. For this you had a procedure called an 
ERCP, and received antibiotics. The doctors who did your ERCP 
would like to repeat the procedure in 4 weeks. Please call them 
for an appointment.

You were evaluated by our surgeons, who felt that you needed to 
have your gallbladder removed.

You were taken to the operating room on ___ and had your 
gallbladder removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the 
procedure well and are now being discharged home to continue 
your recovery with the following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY: 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
