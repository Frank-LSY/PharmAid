Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Right arm and face tingling, aphasia, frontal headache
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Pt felt like his usual self morning of presentation. Around 
noon,
he mowed the lawn. When he finished around 13:00, he noted R 
hand
tingling and numbness that gradually spread proximally up his 
arm
to his R lower face. He then noted difficulty producing speech.
He could understand others just could not get his words out. His
wife called EMS. In the field, vitals were 200/120 88 17 96% 
room
air. Blood sugar 111. Pt was then brought to an OSH ED.

At presentation to OSH, BP 180/118 and pt otherwise HD stable.
NIHSS 3 (1-lanuage, 2-dysarthria). Symptoms began to gradually
improve about 20 minutes after onset. Per OSH report, "speech
almost back to normal although he is having problmes finding 
some
words". ___ showed a "8 mm aneurysm in communicating artery".
Pt was then transferred to ___ for further management

Of note, after the improvement of his speech difficulty and 
right
arm and face numbness, pt noted a severe, sharp L parietal
headache. He denied having a similar headache prior and stated
this was the worst headache of his life. He had photosensitivity
but no nausea or vomiting. Pain was constant. He denied 
diplopia,
neck stiffness, or any positional component. He does not
typically have headaches, even in his childhood.

At the time of my assessment, pt reported the numbness/tingling
was completely resolved. He felt his speech was significantly
improved but not quite back to his baseline. He denied any
dysarthria. These symptoms had never happened before. He had no
other complaints.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies
lightheadedness or confusion. Denies difficulty comprehending
speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, 
vertigo,
tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies
focal muscle weakness, numbness, parasthesia. Denies bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, chest
pain, palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, dysuria or rash.

IMAGING
=======
CTA H&N - ___
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of infarct. 
7 mm A-comm aneurysm. 2 small distal midline ACA saccular 
structures seen on 3D reconstruction images are likely artifact 
due to vascular or dural calcifications. Recommend correlation 
with angiography if this is planned. Right-greater-than-left 
internal carotid artery calcification near the 
bifurcation. No significant ICA stenosis by NASCET criteria. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. No ASD or LV thrombus seen.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Presented after acute onset RUE and R face numbness and 
tingling, symptoms of a global aphasia, and ___ frontal 
headache while mowing the lawn. His symptoms largely resolved 
upon presentation to the ED with only trace aphasia more of a 
posterior form (some paraphasic errors) remaining after a day. 
CTA showed a 7mm A-comm aneurysm, which was deemed to be 
possibly incidental as it did not refer directly to his 
symptoms. However, may be resulting in seizure or migraine that 
indirectly induce his symptoms. 

He will follow-up with Neurosurgery, Dr. ___, at the end of 
___. Most likely, we will obtain follow-up imaging in several 
months to see if there is any increase in the size of the 
aneurysm.

His presumptive diagnosis is a TIA. TTE found symmetric LVH with 
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function; no 
ASD or LV thrombus seen.  He will undergo repeat CTA in 3 months 
to monitor the aneurysm. For the TIA, he was switched to Plavix 
since he had been on Aspirin when he came in and had these 
symptoms. In addition, he was started on atorvastatin 80mg due 
to LDL 180. He should have his lipid panel repeated by PCP ___ 
___ weeks.  

He will be setup with a 30-day event monitor as an outpatient to 
monitor for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He will follow-up 
with Dr. ___ stroke neurology in 3 months. 

His TSH was also markedly elevated at 14, although he shows no 
signs of clinical hypothyroidism, which will be followed-up by 
PCP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of speech difficulty 
(aphasia) and right arm tingling/numbness likely resulting from 
a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is temporarily 
blocked by a clot. It is similar to a stroke, however in TIA the 
blockage rapidly resolves. The brain is the part of your body 
that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so 
damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can 
result in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke/TIA can have many different causes, so we assessed you 
for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having 
stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify 
those risk factors. Your risk factors are:  
- High cholesterol
- Vascular disease
- Hypertension
- History of smoking
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- STOP taking aspirin. 
- START taking clopidogrel (Plavix) DAILY. 
- RESUME your home triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide. 
- START taking atorvastatin 80mg DAILY. 
- Resume
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology, Neurosurgery, and your primary 
care physician. 
 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
