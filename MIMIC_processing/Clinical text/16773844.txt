Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old lady with diabetes and GERD 
who is admitted to the Neurology stroke service with left face 
and arm weakness and dysarthria secondary to an acute ischemic 
stroke in the Right internal capsule. She was given tpa. MRI 
confirmed location of her stroke. Her stroke was most likely 
secondary to small vessel disease event given her risk factors 
and the appearance and location of the infarct. She was started 
on dual antiplatelet therapy of ASA 81 and Plavix. Her deficits 
improved greatly prior to discharge and the only notable 
weakness was in the left arm and left face. She was evaluated by 
physical therapy and felt to be ok to discharge home with 
outpatient ___. She will complete a TTE as an outpatient to 
complete stroke workup. TTE was felt to not need to be done 
inpatient as etiology felt to be small vessel disease.

Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 9.1%
2) Mild intracranial atherosclerosis - mild atherosclerotic 
calcifications of the cavernous internal carotid arteries
3) Hyperlipidemia: started on atorvastatin 80 mg with LDL 124, 
goal <70 in stroke
4) Obesity

TRANSITONAL ISSUES
DM: metformin increased to 1000 mg BID, consider further changes 
to DM regimen
HLD: atorvastatin started at 80 mg for LDL goal <70 in stroke
Stroke: Aspirin + plavix for 3 months, then aspirin 81 mg daily 
monotherapy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left face and arm 
weakness and trouble speaking resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
diabetes
high cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows:
INCREASE Metformin to 1000mg twice daily
ADD Atorvastatin 80mg
ADD Aspirin 81mg
ADD Plavix 75mg

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
