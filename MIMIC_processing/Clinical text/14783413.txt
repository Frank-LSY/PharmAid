STRESS TEST on ___:
=====================
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a history of HTN was 

referred to the lab from the ER following negative serial 
cardiac 
markers for evaluation of arm discomfort and fatigue as possible 
anginal 
equivalent. The patient exercised for 4 minutes of ___ 
protocol and 
was stopped for progressive chest/throat burning ___ that began 
one 
minute into exercise. The estimated peak MET capacity was 4.9 
which 
represents a fair functional capacity for her age. During the 
chest/throat discomfort, there was 1-1.5 mm horizontal/scooping 
STD in 
the inferolateral leads and 0.5 mm STE in aVR. The symptoms and 
ST 
changes resolved with rest. The rhythm was sinus with rare 
isolated 
apbs, one atrial triplet and one vpb. Appropriate hemodynamic 
response 
to exercise and recovery. 
IMPRESSION: Ischemic EKG changes with anginal type symptoms 
beginning at 
very low workload. 

CARDIAC CATH on ___:
=====================
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is
moderate tortuosity beginning in the mid segment.
The Septal Perforator, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
small caliber vessel.
The Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
large caliber vessel. There is moderate
tortuosity beginning in the distal segment.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel. There is moderate
tortuosity beginning in the mid segment.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel.
The Acute Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
small caliber vessel.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
Interventional Details
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.

Findings
 No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
Recommendations
 Maximize medical therapy
 
Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARIES: Unknown 
# PUMP: Normal 
# RHYTHM: Normal sinus 

___ y.o. F w/ h/o HTN, family history of CAD (brother w/ CABG x 4 
in ___, sister w/ MI in ___, hepatitis C s/p treatment/cure, 
depression, Vit D deficiency who presents with 1 month h/o 
worsening chest burning and arm pain c/f unstable angina found 
to have positive stress test at low exercise work-load w/ STE 
AVR admitted for cath that showed no angiographically apparent 
coronary artery disease.

#Atypical chest pain 
Patient with atypical chest pain. One day of worsened exercise 
tolerance. Tropsx2 negative. Stress test with ischemic EKG 
changes with anginal type symptoms beginning at 
very low workload. Given strong family history and abnormal 
stress test, patient taken for catheterization, which showed no 
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. Patient may 
have microvascular disease and could consider coronary calcium 
scan as outpatient. Patient was continued on home aspirin. 

#HTN 
Initial blood pressures notable for SBPs 160s that improved to 
130-140s without intervention. Patient continued on home HCTZ 
daily and amlodipine 5mg was added to her regimen. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

#Depression 
-Continued on home sertraline 

#Adrenal incidentaloma
- Patient followed by endocrine. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
Discharge weight: 83.1kg (183 lbs) 

[] Consider coronary calcium scan as outpatient given family 
history and if calcium score >100, could start statin and/or 
discontinue aspirin.

[] Patient should have continued workup as outpatient for 
fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance.
