Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of at ___ 
___.

You were admitted to the hospital for symptoms of tongue and 
throat swelling. You were given a ___ of intravenous steroids 
and switched to oral steroids, in addition to a ___ of 
epinephrine, which improved your breathing and significantly 
reduced your tongue and throat swelling. You were re-started on 
a regular diet and tolerated this well.

While it is unclear what precipitated the cause of your 
symptoms, it is possible this may have been due to use of 
diclofenac or an allergy to nut products. Please avoid use of 
medications known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such 
as aspirin, celecoxib, diclofenac, diflunisal, etodolac, 
ibuprofen, or indomethacin) or any nut products until you follow 
up with an allergist for further workup of a potential cause of 
your symptoms.

If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, tongue or 
throat swelling, difficulty swallowing or speaking, fevers, 
chills, chest pain, cough, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or 
diarrhea, please return to the Emergency Department for further 
care.

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
