Brief Hospital Course:
LEGAL & SAFETY:  

On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. They were also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.

PSYCHIATRIC:

___ is a ___ y/o single Caucasian female college student 
with h/o MDD, unspecified anxiety disorder, PTSD,?borderline 
personality traits, admitted to inpatient psychiatry by way of 
___ after reporting worsening SI with plan/intent at preceding ___ 
psychology intake appointment. On admission interview, patient 
reported longstanding h/o depressed mood and anxiety associated 
with fear of losing social
relationships. Reports period of stability in mood from ___ - 
___ grade where she denied having many social interactions and 
was able to fully devote herself to school, which seems to be 
one of the few things she ___ previously enjoyed. Also period of 
stability from ___ during which time she was 
accepted to ___ and reports feeling validated. However 
since ___ reporting emergence of depression, marked by 
profound neuro-vegetative symptoms, increasing anxiety centered
around losing relationships with friends culminating in SI with 
"strong urgency not to be here" with consideration of plan 
including cutting herself with exacto knife. ___ not acted on 
these plans and appears intent is of reduced intensity. Denied 
associated substance use or primary medical issues. Cognitive 
exam was intact. MSE notable for petite, younger than age 
appearing woman, soft-spoken, please however with anxious 
constricted affect. Denied AVH, HI. 

Diagnostic presentation c/f major depressive disorder, current 
depressive episode and unspecified anxiety disorder that seems 
to primarily be centered around interpersonal relationships and 
fear of abandonment. No evidence of generalized anxiety disorder 
at this time. Probable diagnosis of PTSD as well given complex 
trauma history related to her upbringing - father deceased, 
mother with  substance use issues propagating issues with 
attachment we see today. Finally, we also thought it was 
important to consider borderline personality traits in this 
patient given issues with attachment, self injurious tendencies, 
and affective instability. 

In terms of interventions, we restarted her home medication 
(escitalopram 20 mg) and then uptitrated to 25 mg (EKG QTC wnl, 
431) however decided to trial different antidepressant given 
that patient had been experiencing depressive symptoms on 
maximum dose for the past several months. As such, escitalopram 
was discontinued and we started by trialing Zoloft 50 mg QAM and 
Lamictal 12.5 mg QPM which we added to mitigate her affective 
instability. Psychoeducation was provided on depression and 
Uptodate Patient Education handout provided on depression/SSRIs. 
Psychoeducation was also provided on medication adherence and 
suicide prevention. We also coordinated with her outpatient 
mental health care providers to set up robust aftercare - upon 
discharge she had a re-entry appointment with ___ , f/u 
psychiatry appointment with ___ psychiatrist Dr. ___, 
f/u psychology appointment with ___, and f/u 
appointment with her PCP. 

Over each day of her inpatient stay, patient's  affect became 
brighter and she denied having thoughts of SI while on the 
inpatient unit. She remained pleasant on the unit, was visible 
in milieu interacting with select peers, and attended groups. On 
day of discharge she was goal directed (wanted to re-prioritize 
focus on school), future-oriented & motivated, and reported 
positive therapeutic alliance with her BU mental health 
providers who we coordinated aftercare with. 

SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS: no active issues
 
MEDICAL

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS

increased risk of harm to herself longstanding, passive thoughts 
of "not wanting to live" "I have a
vague sense of wanting to die" with recent feelings of "urgency" 
and consideration of plans of committing suicide including using 
exacto knife and overdosing on medications. Her static risk 
factors at that time Caucasian race, history of self injurious 
behavior, chronic mental illness, trauma hx, family history of 
suicide attempt. Modifiable risk factors including current

limited social supports, hopelessness, social withdrawal. These 
modifiable risk factors were addressed by medication changes, 
psychoeducation, supportive psychotherapy, motivational 
interviewing, and connection with outpatient mental health 
treatment at ___ upon discharge. Finally the patient had many 
protective risk factors including appropriate insight, 
help-seeking nature, no irritability/agitation, no 
rage/anger/revenge, good problem solving skills, and no SI on
