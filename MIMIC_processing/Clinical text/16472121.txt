Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female s/p thoracic SCS
placement at ___ ___.  She was to f/u in clinic yesterday 
for
wound evaluation after she reported wound drainage.  She missed
her appointment and was told to present to the ED.  On 
assessment
she had drainage from the incision and erythema.  She was
afebrile with WBC of 5.1.  She was started on Ancef IV Q 8 hrs. 
She remained afebrile with a flat white count.  On reassessment
of the incision there was no further drainage and erythema was
improved.  The patient was admitted to the floor for 
observation.

At 1600 nursing paged stating that the patient was asking to
leave for social reasons.  She states she has no care for her 
dog
or her nieces' children and she has to go home.  I explained 
that
this infection could get worse if we stop IV antibiotics and 
that
she may still need to go to the OR for I&D.  I explained that 
she
could develop another abscess and the infection could spread and
become life threatening.  She voices understanding off this and
explains she would prefer to leave on oral antibiotics and 
return
next week for evaluation.  I explained that should she develop a
fever, worsening erythema, tenderness, or return of fluid
collection or drainage that she should present tot he ED
immediately.  She expresses understanding of this and agrees to
the plan.
