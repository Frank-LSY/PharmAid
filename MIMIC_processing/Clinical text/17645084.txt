Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC:
#On admission to the inpatient psychiatric unit, patient was 
calm and cooperative, and in good behavioral control. He stated 
that he had felt increasingly depressed over the past month, and 
particularly over the past week. He stated that he knew he 
needed help, but that he did not believe that he needed an 
inpatient unit. Patient consented to care, but did not sign a 
conditional voluntary. 

During hospitalization, the patient received individual, group, 
and milieu therapy. He was started on Citalopram 10mg PO QD for 
neurovegetative symptoms and depressed mood. He did not report 
any side effects. Patient stated that talking to the other 
patients on the unit helped him to understand that his problems 
were difficult but not impossible, and made him realize that he 
was well-equipped to deal with them. Stated that he no longer 
had any thoughts about not being alive, and denied any passive 
or active suicidal intent or plan. Stated that he regretted his 
actions and his ongoing legal matters, but that he felt that he 
could cope with them due to outpatient supports including 
friends and the ___.

On discharge, mental status exam was significant for "good" 
mood, euthymic affect, intact cognition, linear and 
goal-directed thought process, and denial of any suicidal or 
homicidal thoughts.

SAFETY: The patient remained in good behavioral control 
throughout this hospitalization and did not require physical or 
chemical restraint. The patient remained on 15 minute checks, 
which is our lowest acuity level of checks.

GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
-No chronic or acute medical conditions

PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) MILIEU/GROUPS: The patient attended several groups, and was 
animated, euthymic, and participatory in the milieu. He was 
visible on the unit and frequently had conversations with his 
peers. He never engaged in any unsafe behaviors. He ate meals in 
the milieu, slept well, and cooperated with unit rules.

#) COLLATERAL: Patient's outpatient treaters at ___ were collaborated with during this admission and 
discharge.

LEGAL STATUS: Patient refused a conditional voluntary agreement 
on presentation, and remained on a ___ throughout his 
stay.

RISK ASSESSMENT: 
This patient is not currently abusing subtances, is not suicidal 
or homicidal, is feeling well and is animated, euthymic, and 
participatory in the milieu, all of which indicate a low 
immediate risk of harm.
Static risk factors include:
-Male sex, single marital status, impulsive/aggressive 
tendencies
Modifiable risk factors include:
-hopelessness, limited social support, sense of isolation, 
active SI
We modified these risks by starting the patient on citalopram 
for his depressed mood and neurovegetative symptoms, as well as 
coordinating outpatient care to further address his underlying 
stressors and improve his outpatient social support.
Protective factors include:
-compliance with outpatient care, future-oriented, help-seeking
Current risk is low for intentional self-harm given that the 
patient denies suicial ideation, intent, and plan, is accepting 
of treatment, is currently sober, and is future oriented with 
plans to return to school and attend a job interview. States 
that he feels well-equipped to deal with the stress of his 
oncoming trial. 

INFORMED CONSENT:
I discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, and 
possible side effects of this medication, and risks and benefits 
of possible alternatives, including not taking the medication, 
with the patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide 
whether to take this medicaiton as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any questions about medications with the treatment team, and I 
answered the patient's questions. The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

PROGNOSIS:
The patient's prognosis is good, as he has had no prior suicide 
attempts, has no prior hospitalizations or formal psychiatric 
history, is currently sober, actively 
engaged in treatment, and refusing suicidal ideation.
