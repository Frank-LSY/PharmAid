Per Dr. ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry Consult note:

"Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a PPHx of Schizoaffective
d/o. He was being seen as an outpatient at ___ at
___ and told them today that he has been hearing
voices telling him to kill himself, which prompted the ED
referral.

Early on in ___ he started having paranoid delusions that his
co-workers were conspiring against him and framing him. He then
quit his job and started hearing multiple angelic voices telling
him "you should kill yourself", "everybody hates you". He also
reports being "followed, stalked, and watched by priests" from
the ___ who had also "prearranged" his trip to the ED. He
endorses thought broadcasting, thought insertion, ideas of
reference, and paranoia that his doctors are trying to hurt him.
He endorses seeing shadowy figures in his peripheral vision and
yesterday saw "melting faces" in photos. He says that his
hallucinations are sometimes "inside" and sometimes "outside" 
his
head. While he reports hearing some voices constantly, he says
that the voices become much worse "episodically" lasting
hours-days, and that these worsened periods are becoming more
frequent (latest episode was yesterday for most of the day).

Mr. ___ reports that the voices cause him significant fear
and depression, especially recently. Since ___ he endorses
worsening disorganized thoughts, feeling "depressed", 
"hopeless",
poor sleep (despite constantly feeling tired), poor appetite, 
and
weight loss. He also reports that he used to enjoy painting and
writing poetry, but that recently he feels too distressed by the
voices to engage in those activities. He also endorses
fluctuating levels of concentration and memory, and says "My
thoughts are either racing or gone". He denies current suicidal
intent ("I'm not going to kill myself") but had made a plan 
years
ago (hanging, walking in front of train). He also admits that if
the voices forced him to kill himself, "I don't know what I 
would
do". He denies HI. 

He reports that he first heard voices at age ___ and was first
psychiatrically hospitalized that year when he became suicidal.
He was started on Lithium. Since then he has had several
psychiatric hospitalizations for SI with plan and intent. In ___ he was Hospitalized in ___ for SI, and reports that he
was also hearing voices at the time. In ___ he was
hospitalized for depression and SI at ___. He believes these
suicidal thoughts are greatly exacerbated by his ongoing
hallucinations that are telling him to kill himself. He reports
that the only time the voices have been "as bad as they are now"
was in ___ when he attended a day program in ___. 
He
was subsequently started on Geodon.

He describes a two-week period in ___ where he endorsed
reduced need for sleep, grandiosity, goal-directed behavior ("I
cleaned the whole house for 10 hours straight"), and "racing
thoughts"."

In the ED, the patient remained under good behavioral control 
and
did not receive any medications.

On admission interview today, patient reports that he is feeling
as though even though he has been told this is a hospital but it
"feels very replicated".  Patient reports continued auditory and
visual hallucinations telling him that he is "trapped", "I am
stuck", "and I am going to die".  He denies any command auditory
hallucinations to hurt himself at this time.  He also relates
concerns that he has been concerned about consuming food as he
believes that the food in his partial program was "medicated". 
He also continues to endorse difficulty fixing on faces and 
feels
that he sees "robotic or dead eyes" and faces that look like 
they
are melting.  Patient also endorses confusion, poor appetite,
poor sleep, and issues with concentration.  He has difficulty
elucidating a timeline of his symptoms during our interview.  He
has difficulty registering the timeline of his current admission
and thinks he has been in the hospital for multiple days.  He
also endorses anxiety with racing thoughts.  He denies any manic
symptoms including decreased need for sleep, talkativeness for
pressured speech, or grandiosity.  As above patient reports
significant psychotic symptoms including auditory and visual
hallucinations, and paranoia.

with a past
psychiatric history of Schizoaffective Disorder. He was being

told them that he has been hearing voices telling him to kill 
himself, which prompted an ED referral. In the ED, patient 
remained under good behavioral control and did not receive any 
medications. Diagnostically, Mr. ___ likely presented with 
decompensation of longstanding schizoaffective disorder in the 
setting of worsening auditory/visual hallucinations and acute 
stressors  During our initial interview with Mr. ___, he 
endorsed ongoing paranoid thoughts such as feeling unsafe and 
distrustful of being on the unit. He endorsed ongoing delusions 
such as being "anti-Christ" and feeling that he and his wife are

psychotic symptoms had worsened since starting his new job.

co-workers. Mr. ___ also had ongoing issues with medication 
non-adherence, particularly with his lithium. Upon initial

daily with Hydroxyzine 25 mg standing for anxiety/insomnia. He 
reported tolerating these medications well, without any side 
effects. Upon re-assessment of Mr. ___ days after 
restarting his medications, Mr. ___ endorsed improved 
symptoms including decreased paranoia, less frequent auditory 
hallucinations that are no longer command in nature, and stable 
mood/affect. He also showed significantly improved insight on 
his condition, with reported understanding that his paranoia and 
distrust upon presentation were due to his condition. Mr. 
___ still continued to have auditory hallucinations, 
although less frequently and were no longer command in nature. 
His lithium was increased to 600 mg PO nightly, and 300 mg PO in 
the morning, which he tolerated well without reported side 
effects. Mr. ___ was also amenable to enrolling in a partial 
hospitalization program upon discharge.  He denied any thoughts 
of self harm, suicidal ideation plan or intent. He noted several 
coping mechanisms and plan for periods of stress following 
discharge. On discharge patient was prescribed: Prazosin 1 mg PO
