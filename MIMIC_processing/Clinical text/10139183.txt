None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of hypertension
who was transferred from an outside hospital after he presented
there with left-sided sensory changes and ataxia, for which he
received TPA.

He was in his usual state of health today and lie down on the
couch with his grandson at approximately 4:30 ___.  At 5 ___ he
describes the onset of a sudden sense of tingling in the left
leg.  He has never had anything similar before.  He felt the 
need
to move around so he tried to move his grandson.  When he did 
so,
he noted that it was very difficult to control his left arm.  He
denies weakness, but rather states that it was hard to control. 
He then tried to stand and noted the same sense of poor control
in the left leg.  He tried to put on shoes but was unable to do
so due to lack of coordination.  At some point he also
experienced the onset of similar tingling in the left arm and
face.

He was brought to ___, initial blood pressure
was 159/100.  Exam is notable for left arm and leg ataxia.  ___
stroke scale was 2 for these problems, though he also reported
odd sensations in the left arm and leg.  CT head and CTA head 
and
neck were obtained and were reportedly unremarkable.  
Tele-stroke
evaluation was obtained and it was recommended that he be given
TPA.  Bolus was given at 20:11.  He was transferred here for 
post
TPA care.

On arrival to ___, he states that the discoordination in
his arm and leg are now gone.  He states that this occurred 
about
an hour after receiving the TPA.  10 used experienced some 
slight
sensory abnormalities in the left arm, leg, and face.  He denies
any weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, vision changes, vertigo,
headache.
 
 
On general review of systems, the patient denies recent fever, 
chills, night sweats, or recent weight changes. Denies cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, palpitations. 
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal
pain.  Denies dysuria, or recent change in bowel or bladder
habits.  Denies arthralgias, myalgias, or rash.
 
Past Medical History:
Hypertension
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
No family history of stroke.  Both parents, and 1 of his 
brothers have heart disease.

IMAGING
=======
- ___ MRI Head
1. No evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass lesion. 

- ___ TTE
Large right-to-left shunt of microbubbles into the left atrium 
c/w a stretched PFO/atrial septal defect. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes, regional/global systolic function. Mild mitral 
regurgitation with normal valve morphology.

- ___ Bilateral Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

- ___ CTA/CTV Abdomen & Pelvis
1. Patent venous vasculature, without evidence of thrombus. 
2. No acute intra-abdominal process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of hypertension 
who was transferred to ___ after the acute onset of 
left-sided ataxia and sensory changes, for which he received 
TPA. On arrival to ___, his ataxia had completely 
resolved he reported only mild sensory loss on the left side. 
MRI did not show an acute stroke. Stroke workup revealed 
increased LDL. TTE with large PFO/ASD and R-to-L shunting 
raising c/f cryptogenic stroke. He is at increased risk for DVT 
given his job as a ___. Lower extremity Dopplers and 
CTV of the pelvic veins was negative for any deep venous 
thrombi. He was discharged on aspirin and atorvastatin. 
Hypercoagulability labs were sent and will be followed up. The 
final diagnosis was aborted stroke, with possible etiology due 
to DVT from his risk factors of being a ___ and having 
a large PFO. If this was in fact the case, he is fortunate to 
have presented to care very quickly and receiving tPA in less 
than 3 hours from symptoms onset. 

- Follow-up labs: anti-cardiolipin antibodies, lupus 
anticoagulant, beta-2-microglobulin, protein C panel, protein S 
panel, antithrombin activity, and homocysteine. 
- Will schedule follow-up with Dr. ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of weakness likely 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms. At the previous hospital, you were 
given a clot-busting medication called tPA which may have 
dissolved the clot before it caused you any permanent injury. 

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
An echocardiogram of your heart showed a PFO (patent foramen 
ovale) which is a communication between two of the chambers of 
your heart and can cause clots from your veins to pass through 
to your arteries and cause stroke. In order to prevent future 
strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors 
are the following: 
- High cholesterol. 
- Patent foramen ovale. 
 
 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 - START taking aspirin 81mg daily. 
 - START taking atorvastatin 40mg daily. 

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. 
 
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
