IMAGING:
==========
Coronary Anatomy
Coronary Description
The left main, left anterior descending, circumflex and right 
coronary artery have no angiographically
significant coronary abnormalities.
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.
Findings
 No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
 Mildly elevated LVEDP.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[] CRP elevated this admission (lab drawn to determine risk 
score for statin therapy) - unclear reason but please follow up 
with appropriate workup.
[] Unclear etiology of dyspnea on exertion x 1 week, not 
believed to be related to cardiac ischemia based on clean 
cardiac cath. Please consider other etiologies if DOE continues.
[] CARDIOLOGY: LVEDP on cardiac cath 16, mildly elevated.
[] Not initiated on any medications (Statin, ASA), given ACC/AHA 
risk calculation.
[] CT chest with Mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening, 
consider treating symptomatically for acute or chronic 
bronchitis if persists, and obtaining PFTs. 
[]CT chest with partially imaged liver demonstrates scattered 
hypodensities, not fully characterized on this study, possibly 
representing cysts. 

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
===========================
___ year old female with PMH of thalassemia trait and 
pre-diabetes who presented to her PCP ___ 1 week of increasing 
DOE and tachycardia, with stress test concerning for inducible 
ischemia. Troponins negative x 2 and EKG with no ischemic 
changes, underwent coronary cath ___ which did not show any 
significant disease.

CORONARIES: No angiographically apparent coronary artery 
disease, Mildly elevated LVEDP 
PUMP: 69% based on nuclear perfusion study ___
RHYTHM: sinus

=============== 
ACTIVE ISSUES: 
=============== 

#DOE 
#Clean coronaries 
Patient presents with 1 week of progressive dyspnea on exertion 
with CTA ___ showing no evidence of pulmonary embolism or 
aortic dissection, pulmonary parenchyma notable for mild diffuse 
bronchial wall thickening. Nuclear stress showed probable 
inferior apical reversible defect, with clinical concern for 
unstable angina given this result. She remained chest pain free 
this hospitalization, with trop negative x 2 and EKG with no 
ischemic changes. Started on ASA, metop, atorvastatin, however 
given no significant disease on catheterization and low ACC/AHA 
___ year risk calculations (1.5%), no indication for these 
medications at this time. Pt will follow up with outpatient PCP 
if DOE continues for further workup.

#Elevated CRP
CRP found to be mildly elevated to 7.8 this admission (measured 
for cardiovascular disease risk score stratification). Will 
follow up as outpt.

================ 
CHRONIC ISSUES: 
================ 
# GERD: continued omeprazole daily.

# Cold urticaria. Knows symptoms and is able to avoid
significant flare ups per PCP ___. 

#HLD recent outpatient lipid panel with ASCVD risk 2.9%, will
add-on hscrp (___) as ___ risk score seems more
appropriate given family history and ethnicity 
- atorvastatin 40 now, consider increasing to 80

# liver cysts: On CT, partially imaged liver demonstrates
scattered hypodensities, not fully characterized on this study,
possibly representing cysts.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. 

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted to the hospital because you had shortness of 
breath while walking and a stress test that showed an area of 
your hear might not be getting good blood flow.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You underwent a procedure called cardiac catheterization, 
which revealed that all of the blood vessels in your heart were 
working well and there were no blockages.
- Ultimately it is still not clear why you are having the 
shortness of breath with walking, but we felt it is safe to 
finish the evaluation outside of the hospital. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
- You should continue to take your medications as prescribed. 
- You should attend the appointments listed below.   
- Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms 
or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or 
shortness of breath at night.  

We wish you the best!
Your ___ Care Team
