Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
?embolic stroke, & multiple aneurysns on CTA.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with PMH significant for AFib (on Coumadin),
TIA, aneurysm s/p coil embolization, directly admitted from
___ to ___ for further investigation of  ?embolic 
stroke,
new aneurysms on CTA. 

She presented to ___ following ___ days of left-sided
facial droop.  On ___, the patient reports a fall with injury 
to
her hip, precipitated by lightheadedness holding her BP meds in
preparation for planned dental procedure that day. She denies 
LOC
or headstrike.  The following day, she underwent extraction of a
left upper canine tooth and placement with an implant for which
she had been holding her Coumadin for the 3 days prior to this
procedure.  

Shortly after her tooth extraction, she says that her boyfriend
noticed left sided facial drooping - but she attributed this to
to the recent dental procedure and the associated swelling of 
the
left face. 
 
On ___, the patient reports a second fall - this time in the
shower, and headstrike at the back of her head.  She again 
denies
loss of consciousness.  
 
Upon presentation to ___, the patient reported CC of
ongoing facial droop and some new limping since her recent 
falls.
Her workup included a CTA that revealed ?embolic stroke, and
newly identified aneurysms. She was transferred to ___ for
further evaluation and management.

Pertinent Results:
___ IMAGING: 
___ NCHCT Findings: 
Comparison with prior CT head ___, prior MRI brain
___. There is artifact from aneurysm coils near the
right optic canal and at the left ICA termination. There is
reduced attenuation of right caudate nucleus head, right 
putamen,
right internal capsule anterior limb, right insular cortex and
also right temporal pole consistent with an acute right MCA
territory infarct. No hemorrhage. The right lateral ventricle
partially effaced. No midline shift however. No definite mass No
abnormality of CSF spaces or ventricles shown. Gray/white matter
differentiation elsewhere maintained. 
Paranasal sinuses, petromastoids, globes, orbits and skull are
unremarkable.
 
Conclusion: 
1. Acute infarct of the right basal ganglia, insular cortex and
temporal lobe without hemorrhage or significant midline shift.
2. Artifact from left and right skull base level metallic
aneurysm coils. 
2. No acute hemorrhage, no mass, or fracture.

CTA ___: Conclusion: 
1. Limited study for the reasons outlined above.
2. Complex arterial abnormality of the tortuous right internal
carotid artery just below skull base, possibly involving a
tubular PTFE graft. Possibly localized dehiscence and
pseudoaneurysm formation reaching 10 x 9 mm, differential
includes chronic arterial dissection.
3. Aneurysm coils generating artifact related to the left ICA
termination in the right carotid ophthalmic origin region.
4. 2 right sided MCA saccular aneurysms of 5, 3 mm.
5. Infundibular dilatation of the left posterior communicating
artery origin from ICA.
6. No major intracranial arterial occlusion. However, symmetric
diffuse ICA narrowing at the skull base level in the petrous
cavernous segments.
7. No other significant neck arterial abnormality.
8. Incidental cervical degenerative disc, facet disease.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 2:17 ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Acute right MCA territory infarction, as above. 
2. At least two saccular aneurysms arising from the right mid 
and distal M1 measuring at least up to 4 mm. 
3. Scattered bilateral foci of susceptibility artifact 
concerning for 
microhemorrhage in the bifrontal, left occipital, and right 
temporal lobe.  Alternative etiology is small thrombi within 
distal arterial branch vessels. 
4. Coils in the region of left ICA carotid terminus and anterior 
communicating artery consistent with prior aneurysm coiling. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Embolic Stroke: Patient transferred from ___ for ___ 
consistent with an acute infarct of the right basal ganglia, 
insular cortex and temporal lobe without hemorrhage or 
significant midline shift. Her symptoms on arrival to ___ 
included ___ days of left-sided facial droop and a recent fall 
with injury to
her hip, precipitated by lightheadedness. On arrival to ___ 
Stroke Neurology service was consulted and recommended obtaining 
an MRI of the brain, A1C, lipid panel, and strongly recommend 
resuming the patients home Warfarin as it was on hold for 
potential Neurosurgical intervention. Warfarin was restarted on 
___. An MRI Was completed per Neurology recommendations and 
suggested an acute right MCA territory infarction, at least two 
saccular aneurysms arising from the right mid and distal M1 
measuring at least up to 4 mm, scattered bilateral foci of 
susceptibility artifact concerning for microhemorrhage in the 
bifrontal, left occipital, and right temporal lobe.  Alternative 
etiology is small thrombi within distal arterial branch vessels. 
Coils in the region of left ICA carotid terminus and anterior 
communicating 
artery consistent with prior aneurysm coiling. Neurology did not 
feel further intervention was required this admission and 
recommended outpatient follow up with Dr. ___ & Dr. 
___ in ___s starting the patient on 
Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
