Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female with a h/o GERD, HTN, HLD, 
depression, and memory problems who presented with ongoing 
nausea and emesis.

without emesis and tolerating PO. She was treated with zofran 
and compazine prn for nausea.

# Mild RUQ Pain: pt reports mild RUQ pain, however no tenderness

+ sumatriptan prn. Resolved by HOD 2.
