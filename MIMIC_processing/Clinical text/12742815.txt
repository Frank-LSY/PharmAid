Discharge Instructions:
-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to 
possibly experience some urgency and frequency over the next 
month;  this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or 
the indwelling ureteral stent.  You may aslo experience some 
pain associated with spasm of your ureter.

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may be fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed. 

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You 
should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.

AVOID lifting/pushing/pulling items heavier than 10 pounds (or 
3 kilos; about a gallon of milk) or participate in high 
intensity physical activity (which includes intercourse) until 
you are cleared by your Urologist in follow-up.

-No DRIVING for TWO or until you are cleared by your Urologist

-You may shower normally but do NOT immerse your nephrostomy 

-Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do not 
operate dangerous machinery

-You may be given prescriptions for a stool softener and/or a 
gentle laxative. These are  over-the-counter medications that 
may be health care spending account reimbursable. 

-Colace (docusate sodium) may have been prescribed to avoid 
post-surgical constipation or constipation related to use of 
narcotic pain medications. Discontinue if loose stool or 
diarrhea develops. Colace is a stool-softener, NOT a laxative.

-Senokot (or any gentle laxative) may have been prescribed to 
further minimize your risk of constipation. 

-If you have fevers > 101.5 F, vomiting, or increased redness, 
swelling, or discharge from your incision, call your doctor or 
go to the nearest emergency room.
