Brief Hospital Course:
Summary
=============
Pt is a ___ male, with a PMH of HTN, HLD, Asthma who presented 
to the ED with chest pain and was found to have ST segment 
elevations in the inferior leads and underwent coronary 
angiography without any flow limiting lesions and no 
intervention.

Active Issues
==============
# CHEST PAIN
# CAD 
Substernal chest pain that began at rest with radiation to the 
right shoulder in a ___ year old male with HTN, HLD and ST 
segment changes concerning for acute ACS. He was taken to the 
cath lab where only moderate coronary disease was uncovered 
without any flow limiting lesions, and no interventions were 
preformed. Given the lack of troponin elevation and clean 
coronaries, this is unlikely to be an acute coronary ischemic 
event. The patient was placed on ASA, Atorvastatin, valsartan 
and metoprolol and discharged chest pain free. 

The etiology of his chest pain remains unclear. CTA chest 
revealed no evidence of aortic dissection or PE. A RUQ u/s was 
read as a normal abdominal ultrasound. No cholelithiasis but 
demonstrated multiple simple hepatic cysts. His pain was 
controlled with ibuprofen.

================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
# HTN - continued home valsartan, HCTZ was held in the setting 
of starting metoprolol.
# HLD - started atorvastatin 80mg.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Multiple simple hepatic cysts seen on RUQ US, continue to 
follow as outpatient.
[] Consider referral to ___ as 
outpatient given CAD.
[] Can re-start hydrochlorothiazide as outpatient pending BP.

HELD medication:
- Hydrochlorothiazide held in setting of starting metoprolol

NEW medication:
- ASA 81mg daily 
- Metoprolol XL 12.5 BID 
- Atorvastatin 80 mg PO/NG QPM 

Weight: 73.07 kg (161.09 lb)
