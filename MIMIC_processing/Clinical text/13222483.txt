Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male, pmh of CP, Seizure do, HIV, alcohol abuse with a 
complicated social history, presenting for increased seizure 
frequency in setting of recent viral illness and medication 
non-compliance. Initial exam was difficult as he was given 3mg 
Ativan in the ___ and loaded with Phenytoin but appears to be 
nonfocal. 

He was admitted for seizure management and was ordered for 
cvEEG. Admission labs did not show any 
toxic/metabolic/infectious cause for increased seizure 
frequency. CXR was clear. Head CT was negative for bleed. 

His somnolence improved on the floor. When he was evaluated by 
our team, he had an episode of right arm shaking that appeared 
to be non-epileptiform that his fiancÃ© identified as his normal 
seizures. He was responsive during the event- responding to a 
command to sit back in bed. He otherwise appeared well aside 
from what appeared to be benzodiazepine side effect. His AED 
levels were low on admission - Phenytoin: 4.1 Carbamazepine: 2.5 
indicating that he was likely not taking his medications and we 
believe that this was likely the etiology for his seizures prior 
to admission. He was loaded with Phenytoin in the ___. We had 
decided that if he returned to baseline later in the day, he 
could be discharged and his home medications could be resumed 
and adjusted with outpatient titration. 

However, shortly afterwards in the early afternoon, his nurse 
found him with a bag of marijuana in his bed. She informed him 
that it was not allowed in the hospital and gave the marijuana 
to his brother to take out of the hospital. At this point he 
became very upset that she did this and stated that he wanted to 
leave. He changed and was evaluated by our team. He was standing 
independently but did appear to be still slightly somnolent - 
almost falling at one point but stumbled to catch himself. He 
stated that he knew he was in the hospital for seizures and 
understood that the risk of leaving was seizures, falls, trauma, 
harm to himself, and possibly death and accepted these risks.

Dear Mr. ___,

Emergency Room, for which you were given Ativan.  You were found

unsteady on day of discharge and requesting to leave against 
medical advice, and expressed understanding of your risk for 
further seizures if you leave now.
