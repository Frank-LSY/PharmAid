History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ yo F w/ PMH depression, anxiety, HTN, 
hypothyroidism. She was in her usual state of health until 11 AM 
___ morning. Her husband first noticed that she was more 
anxious than usual, which he attributed to her getting 
everything ready for an excursion.  She took ___ of a 0.5 mg 
Klonopin tablet at this time.  Then felt that she became 
progressively more anxious, agitated, and also emotional, 
crying. He began to notice that the sentences she was saying 
were not making sense. She was repeating the same words and 
phrases and cycling back on the same things.  He did not have 
difficulty understanding her speech. The phrases that she used 
made sense, however she was not able to put them together to 
arrive at a point.  She states that she is fully aware during 
this and mostly remembers the entire episode, and agrees that 
what happened was abnormal. She states that she remembers saying

she told a friend that they were old. She also recalls looking 
at the sign in the museum in not being able to read it, she felt 
like she cannot mentally focus on it.

that her left foot slap the ground frequently, and that he saw 
her falling to the ground while adjusting her sandal. He states 
that it looked like she was drunk, though there is no alcohol 
consumption that day. she disagrees on there being a gait
abnormality. She states that it was simply because walking those 
particular streets with sandals was difficult and that the L 
sandal had a problem.  After approximately 5 hours she had 
mostly come the back to baseline already.  At the time of 
interview they both agreed that she was back at her baseline.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache, 
lightheadedness, or confusion. Denies difficulty with producing 
or comprehending speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or 
dysphagia. Denies focal muscle weakness, numbness, parasthesia. 
Denies loss of sensation. Denies bowel or bladder incontinence 
or retention. Denies difficulty with gait. On general review of 
systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills. No night sweats 
or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of 
breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No 
recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denies

Imaging: 

MRI brain w/wo:
There is no evidence for an intracranial mass, acute infarction, 
edema, or 
blood products.  There are foci of high T2 signal in the 
periventricular, 
deep, and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, 
which are 
nonspecific but most commonly represent sequela of chronic small 
vessel 
ischemic disease in this age group, though sequela of 
demyelination or 
inflammation may also be considered. Ventricles and sulci are 
age-appropriate.  Major vascular flow voids are grossly 
preserved, though the 
intracranial vasculature is better assessed on the preceding 
CTA. There is a small mucous retention cyst and mild mucosal 
thickening in the 
right maxillary sinus.
 
CT: 
No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute process. 
  
CTA: 
Patent anterior/posterior circulations, circle of ___, and 
major tributaries. Unremarkable neck vessels. 
 
EEG: 
Preliminary report with no evidence of seizure
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F w/ PMH depression, anxiety, HTN, hypothyroidism admitted to 
the neurology service for evaluation of transient lack of 
impulse control, speech, and gait disturbance in the setting of 
buproprion and clonazepam use. Neurologic examination intact. 
MRI brain w/wo contrast did not show evidence of stroke or mass 
lesion. Routine EEG with no evidence of seizure activity on 
preliminary read. She was found to have a UTI and prescribed a 
seven day course of nitrofurantoin. Etiology of her symptoms 
unclear but given unremarkable neurological workup, medication 
side effects are likely a possibility.
