mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy. 

CTA CHEST WITH CONTRAST ___:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aorta 
pathology.

to infection versus aspiration, however hemorrhage cannot be 
excluded considering recent biopsy. 
3. New intraluminal obstructing material within the right 
mainstem bronchus with extension to the right upper lobe 
bronchus and intermediate bronchus suggestive of mucus plugging. 

4. Re-demonstrated right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, 
some of which is necrotic, with encasement and narrowing of the 
right mainstem bronchus by the lymphadenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo lady with history of breast cancer s/p 
mastectomy in ___ with recurrent in ___ with right axillary 
node dissection on Arimidex who was found to have new 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy by her PCP after presenting for 
dyspnea.  She had EBUS with nodal biopsies on ___ and 
presented to ED on ___ with increasing dyspnea.  She was not 
hypoxic, but was found to have narrowing/occlusion of the right 
main stem and bronchus intermedius on CTA chest, so she 
underwent bronchoscopy with stent placement on ___.  Her 
node biopsies from ___ are consistent with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of breast origin.

#Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with compression of right bronchus 
intermedius s/p airway stenting
#Shortness of Breath: She had CT done by PCP ___ ___ for 
shortness of breath and was found to have mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy (some of which is necrotic) with compression of 
right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius.  She had ___ 
EBUS with biopsies and these showed metastatic breast 
adenocarcinoma. She re-presented
on ___ with SOB and found to have compression of right bronchus 
intermedius.  She underwent bronchoscopy with stent with 
restored patency. She will follow up with Dr. ___ on ___ 
in ___.  IP recommended:
-Mucomyst (N-Acetylcysteine) (100 mg/mL, 10 %) solution, 4 ml 
nebulized BID 
-Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL (0.083 %) solution for 
nebulization BID x 10 days
-Nebulizer Machine
-Guafenesin (MucinexÂ®) 1200mg BID 
-Flutter valve (Acapella) BID and PRN congestion

#Metastatic breast adenocarcinoma: Mediastinal node biopsies 
showed breast origin.  She will follow up with her primary 
oncologist Dr. ___ - I have emailed to ask for her to have 
follow up scheduled early this week.  I discussed the results 
with the patient and her daughter.

#Question of pneumonia: ___ was 11 on admission with GGO in RUL 
(?aspiration vs. infection), so she was empirically started on 
vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl on ___.  She has no evidence of 
pneumonia on CTA chest and had no fever and leukocytosis 
resolved.  Discussed with IP who did not recommend continuing 
antibiotics, which I agree with based on CT and clinical 
presentation.

#Insomnia: She has been on Mirtazapine in the past, without 
improvement in insomnia and requested short course of another 
medication to help with sleeping especially in acute setting of 
new cancer diagnosis.  I prescribed short course of Trazodone.
