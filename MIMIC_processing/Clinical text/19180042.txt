History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ female with PMHx significant for COPD (not 
on home o2, FEV1 67% predicted but DLCO 14% predicted) and lung 
nodules s/p left CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy on ___ with 
fiducial
placement, who is presenting with respiratory distress and 
hypoxemia, found to have a left sided pneumothorax.  

She was seen in ___ clinic today for a right sided biopsy and 
fiducial placement with plan to do cyberknife radiation, 
however, her initial SpO2 was 70%. She had a CXR performed which 
revealed left sided pneumothorax so she was sent to the ED. 
  
In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.4 76 154/71 20 95% on 4L 
Nasal Cannula. Her Exam was notable for overall diminished 
breath sounds. IP was consulted and placed a 14 ___ chest

Pleural fluid with ___ WBCs, 34% PMNs, 25% Macrophages, Hct 10, 
Protein 4.1, LDH 539

Patient was given several nebulizer treatments, 125 mg IV 
methylprednisolone, 1L NS, and Morphine 2 gm IV as well as 
Hydromorphone 1 mg IV. She then became unresponsive with VBG pH 
7.20 pCO2 75. She was given narcan with improvement in her 
mental status. Repeat VBG pH 7.22 pCO2 75.
-Vitals prior to transfer: 96.1 71 107/50 14 95% Nasal Cannula

___ CXR A/P
IMPRESSION: 
In comparison with the study ___, there is little overall 
change.  No
definite pneumothorax is appreciated at this time.  The 
appearance of the
heart and lungs is stable
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with PMHx significant for COPD (not on home 
O2, FEV1 67% predicted but DLCO 14% predicted) and bilateral 
lung nodules s/p left CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy on ___ 
with fiducial placement, who is presenting with respiratory 
distress and hypoxemia, found to have a left sided pneumothorax 
with subsequent altered mental status and respiratory acidosis.

#Left pneumothorax: On presentation, patient was found to have a 
left pneumothorax, likely from from fiduciary seed placement. 
Chest tube was placed, and pneumothorax improved. Chest tube was 
d/c'd on ___, and repeat CXR showed resolution of pneumothorax. 
Repeat CXR on ___ again showed resolved PTX.

# Hyponatremia: The patient was also noted to be hyponatremic to 
122 on presentation which improved with fluids and was thought 
to be due to hypovolemic hyponatremia despite somewhat 
indeterminate urine lytes. At the time of discharge, serum Na 
was 131. Pt was discharged with a prescription for a repeat 
sodium to be sent to her PCP's office in case she could not make 
a PCP ___.

# Respiratory acidosis/AMS: While the patient was in the ED, she 
was placed on supplemental oxygen to SpO2 >95% and received 
Morphine 2 gm IV as well as Hydromorphone 1 mg IV. She then 
became unresponsive with VBG pH 7.20 pCO2 75. She was given 
narcan with improvement in her mental status. The patient was 
still confused and fatigued on arrival to the floor, likely from 
CO2 retention in the setting of O2 therapy with severe COPD. Her 
oxygen was turned down and she became more responsive. VBG prior 
to discharge was 7.32/60/55/32. She was alert and oriented for 
the remainder of her hospitalization.
 
# COPD: We had an extensive discussion with patient today 
regarding initiation of home oxygen therapy. This is something 
she has been discussing for some time with her outpatient 
pulmonologist. She was amenable to home oxygen, and she was 
discharged with home oxygen.

Transitional Issues:
-f/u with PCP
-___ will start home oxygen therapy
-Recheck sodium on ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You presented to the ___ with breathing difficulties as well 
as low levels of oxygen in your blood.

A chest X-ray was performed which showed a pneumothorax. This 
means that there was a pocket of air pushing against the lung 
and preventing the lung from fully opening up when you breathe. 
We think this most likely happened as a result of your procedure 
last week where markers were placed in your lung. 

A tube was placed in your chest to remove the air pocket. After 
the tube was removed, a repeat chest X-ray showed that your lung 
had fully re-expanded. 

Your blood tests also showed low levels of sodium in your blood. 
This may be due to dehydration, or your lung disease. We gave 
you IV fluids and limited your water intake. Your sodium levels 
had improved by the time you were discharged. You should have 
your sodium rechecked by your primary care doctor, who you 
should see this week. If you cannot see your PCP, please bring 
your prescription to your nearest urgent care center or 
emergency department to have it checked.

Please see below for a list of your scheduled follow up 
appointments. Continue to take your medications as prescribed. 
We started you on oxygen during your hospital stay. It is very 
important that you continue to use oxygen at home, as it will 
improve your symptoms and overall function.   

You should make sure you call your primary care doctor to make a 
follow up appointment this week.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. We wish 
you all the best. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Medicine team.
