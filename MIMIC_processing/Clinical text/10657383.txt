I met with pts family in ED: sister ___, brother ___ and 
___ wife, ___ as well as nephew ___. The were alarmed by 
the severity of his illness but also understood, aware of his 
underlying morbidity. I learned about Mr ___ and also tried

sense that he would not want very aggressive interventions but 
were questioning. This was corroborated when we found MOLST form 
signed in ___ that specifically identified no CPR, no 
intubation and no dialysis. I called family (they asked me to 
speak first with ___, though they said they made decisions 
together) to inform them of the MOLST and she said that was a
