History of Present Illness:
___ female with a past medical history
of severe scoliosis and hiatal hernia, who presents with
difficulty breathing.

Patient reports that on ___ she began coughing and having
trouble breathing.  Episodes of cough would come and go, at

severe.  On ___ she noted that she coughed a lot after her
dinner.  On ___ she presented to urgent care clinic with
continued coughing.  At that time, chest x-ray was done showing
no pneumonia.  She was prescribed Tessalon Perles and sent home. 

However, she notes that her shortness of breath and coughing was
not improved.  It was worse this morning, and therefore she
returned to urgent care clinic.  She was given a nebulizer and
inhaled corticosteroid per patient, with no improvement.  While
in urgent care clinic, she suddenly became unable to breathe at
all.  She states that the doctor tilted her head back and pushed
her time down which allowed her to breathe.  She also notes that
her oxygen levels were fine during this event.  She was given
Solumedrol 125, and racemic epi, and was sent to the emergency

Imaging/procedure
___ EGD -- "esophageal hiatal hernia"

___ barium swallow -- IMPRESSION:
1. Massively dilated thoracic esophagus with severe dysmotility. 
The distal
esophagus relaxes allowing passage of barium, inconsistent with 
achalasia.
2. Moderate to large sliding hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal 
reflux.
3. Penetration of thin liquids and moderate pharyngeal residue.  
No gross
aspiration on pharyngogram.

___ 06:30AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.5 Mg-1.___ woman with a past medical history of dilated 
esophagus that has undergone previous evaluation, now admitted 
with intermittent cough.  Again discovered to have dilated 
esophagus, with features showing dysmotility and reflux but no 
achalasia.

Overall the patient did well during her admission.  She 
underwent upper endoscopy and barium swallow confirming her 
previously known dilated esophagus without features consistent 
with achalasia.  On the day of discharge we discussed the 
importance of aspiration precautions, and the fact that I would 
be offering a twice daily PPI to her to treat/prevent reflux, 
although she had previously noted that she did not want to be 
taking such a medication and had self-discontinued it before.

We reviewed her discharge plan, the importance of follow-up, and 
she had no additional questions for me.

DETAILS by PROBLEMS

#"massively dilated thoracic esophagus with severe dysmotility"
#"moderate to large sliding hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal 
reflux"
#"penetration of thin liquids and moderate pharyngeal residue"
-___ gastroenterology consulted
-Recommend aspiration precautions, and a PPI twice daily
-It seems that she has chosen not to take a PPI in the past, 
preferring to just drink "hot water"
-He was encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician, 
who is aware of this evaluation, and can refer her as needed to 
a gastroenterologist in ___
Chagas antibodies pending at the time of discharge (apparently 
Chagas disease can be associated with a dilated esophagus) -- if 
positive, the results will be conveyed to the primary care 
physician and the patient for further discussion

#Cough
-patient afebrile, no evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray, flu 
swab negative
Otorhinolaryngology evaluated her and noted ___ female who 
presents from urgent care for evaluation of stridor in the 
setting of dyspnea and cough over the past 24 hours. Per report, 
patient was stridulous when she presented to urgent care, where 
she was given a dose of solumedrol and racemic epinephrine with 
subsequent resolution of her stridor. She was then transferred 
to ___ for further workup. Upon interview, patient states that 
she has had no viral prodrome in recent days. Denies dysphagia, 
odynophagia, trismus, otalgia. Currently complains of minimal 
dyspnea; states that neck extension improves her symptoms. 
Denies smoking history. ORL consulted to evaluate upper airway 
in setting of recent history of stridor and question of possible 
epiglottitis on cervical x-ray obtained in ED. On exam, patient 
is breathing comfortably and quietly on room air with no 
evidence of stridor. No trismus or pain on neck movement. Voice 
not hoarse or muffled. Fiberoptic examination demonstrates 
normal nasopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx with exception of 
mild
erythema of the arytenoids bilaterally. Epiglottis is crisp 
without evidence of erythema/edema. Remainder of supraglottic 
with no evidence of inflammation. Glottis widely patent. Some 
pooling of secretions noted, possibly related to the distention 
of esophagus noted on CXR and cervical x-ray. In summary, this 
___ presenting with dyspnea and reported history of stridor has 
a patent airway with no threatening features. She has a history 
of heartburn with evidence of mild laryngopharyngeal reflux on 
exam.
Plan:
- airway widely patent, no threatening features; stable for 
admission to the regular nursing floor for workup of dyspnea and 
esophageal dilation
- no steroids indicated from ORL perspective
- recommend omeprazole 40 mg BID for treatment of LPR"

-The otorhinolaryngologist also indicated that follow-up could 
be arranged for the pharyngolaryngeal erythema/reflux noted on 
examination, and this recommendation was made to the patient

#Osteopenia - unknown doses of calcium, vit D - resumed at 
discharge 
#Scoliosis -bone health management as above
#S/p bowel resection - patient on multiple vitamins at home, 
unknown doses - resumed vitamins at discharge
