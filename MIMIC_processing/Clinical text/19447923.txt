Neurologic: Sensation is intact in the radial ulnar and median 
nerve distribution, to include the ulnar and radial digital 
nerve of the left third digit, distal to the laceration site.

Musculoskeletal: Focused examination of the left third digit 
demonstrates a transverse laceration which went 
circumferentially along the ulnar border.  The laceration is 
well approximated and closed with nylon suture.  There is no 
erythema or drainage. Slight increased warmth starting at the 
dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joint extending distally

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a pleasant ___ male who unfortunately 
sustained a left third digit distal phalanx laceration/open 
fracture, on ___ secondary to hedge trimmer.  Patient 
underwent irrigation with primary repair at ___ 
emergency that was complicated by cellulitis, so the patient was 
placed on antibiotics for 1 week. He presented to ___ ___ with 
severe pain on passive/active ROM of right middle finger. No 
tenderness to palpation or FDS/FDP. Axial loading of third digit 
MCP did not reproduce pain. Symptoms were most consistent with 
cellulitis.

He was placed in a volar resting splint and hung from a 
stockingnet. Broad spectrum antibiotics were started and his 
cellulitis was marked with a pen. He was placed in observation 
overnight. Throughout his hospital course, he received IV Unasyn 
and had strict RUE elevation in a resting volar splint. His 
edema and erythema improved over the course of his 
hospitalization. At the time of discharge, he was ambulating and 
urinating independently, tolerating a regular diet, and his pain 
was tolerable. He will follow up in Hand Surgery clinic in 1 
week for a wound evaluation.
