Chief Complaint:
Left heel pain, Calcaneal exostosis
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___: Left foot; excision retro-calcaneal exostosis, Achilles 
tendon debridement

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ ___ female, presents for preoperative evaluation
prior to her left heel surgery on ___ for a painful
calcaneal exostosis and Achilles tendinopathy. She has undergone
and failed all conservative treatments and would like to undergo
surgical intervention.  

Of note, she and her sister look after each other. However, her
sister was recently admitted to the hospital and will likely be
unable to take care of her this week and for some of the weeks
following surgery. Given this, she and her sister believe that
she would be better off with rehab placement following surgery.

She reports that she lives in a group home and will likely need
more help and supervision after surgery given the change in
weightbearing status. She is uncertain whether she will be able
to take care of herself and look after her cat. After rehab
placement, she would like to have services provided at home as
well to make sure she is safe.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted 
to the Podiatric Surgery service after your left heel surgery. 
You are being discharged home with the following instructions:

ACTIVITY:
There are restrictions on activity. Please remain non 
weightbearing to your left foot. You should keep this site 
elevated whenever possible (above the level of the heart!). No 
driving until cleared by your podiatric surgeon.

PLEASE MONITOR FOR THE FOLLOWING SIGNS:
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection in your foot. These 
are: 
-a fever greater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit,
-increased redness around your wounds,
-increased pain with swelling,
-pus draining from the incision site. 

If you experience any of these signs or symptoms or see active 
bleeding at the incision site, please call our office at ___. Then, one of our on-call podiatrists will speak to you 
and determine if you need to proceed to the emergency room or 
can be scheduled for an urgent clinic appointment.

Also, please call the office in you experience any increased 
swelling, redness, or pain in your leg or calf, chest pain, 
shortness or breath.

***You may experience some nausea but this could be related to 
your medication  (either antibiotics or pain medication). You 
should not take these medications on an empty stomach. 

EXERCISE:
-Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.
-No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next ___ days.
-Try to keep leg elevated when able.

BATHING/SHOWERING:
You may shower immediately upon coming home, but you must keep 
your dressing CLEAN, DRY and INTACT. You can use a shower bag 
taped around your ankle/leg or hang your foot/leg outside of the 
bathtub. Shower bags or Reuseable Cast and Wound Protectors 
are available at most convenience stores such as ___, 
___, ___, and online on ___. Avoid 
taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four 
weeks after surgery or until cleared by your physician.

WOUND CARE:
Unless you have a visiting nurse set up for you or are 
instructed to change your dressings, please leave them intact 
until your follow up. It is important to keep them dry as noted 
in the Bathing/Showering instructions above.

MEDICATIONS:
Unless told otherwise, you should resume taking all of the 
medications you were taking at home before surgery.

*Pain Medication*

Aside from resting and elevating your foot at home, there are 
medications we may provide you to help reduce your pain.

Unless instructed to not take them, acetaminophen (Tylenol) and 
ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) should be taken first to help relieve 
pain. Acetaminophen can be taken up to 1000 mg every 6 hours 
(not to exceed 4000 mg daily). Ibuprofen can be taken up to 800 
mg every 6 hours (not to exceed 3200 mg daily).

Narcotic pain medications such as oxycodone, Percocet, Vicodin, 
etc. can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and 
bulk foods in your diet. If you feel that you are constipated, 
do not strain at the toilet. If a laxative is not prescribed for 
you, you may use over the counter Metamucil, Milk of Magnesia, 
or Miralax daily while taking opioid pain medications. Appetite 
suppression may occur shortly after surgery and while taking 
these medications but this will improve with time. Eat small 
balanced meals throughout the day.

DIET:
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. 
Poor appetite is not unusual for weeks after surgery and small, 
frequent meals may be preferred.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
Be sure to keep your medical appointments with your surgeon but 
also your primary care physician (PCP).

Please follow up with your podiatric surgeon, Dr. ___. If a 
follow-up appointment was not made prior to your discharge,

locations.

Please make sure to follow up with your primary care physician 
(PCP)  as well regarding your hospital admission within one to 
two weeks to review why you were in the hospital, what you 
underwent, and if you need any of your regular medications 
refilled or adjusted (for example, blood pressure medication). 
While your podiatric physician may manage your other medical 
conditions while in the hospital, it is important to see your 
PCP for further management.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE PODIATRIC SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE.
