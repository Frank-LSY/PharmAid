IMAGING/REPORTS:
================

___ MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITH/WITHOUT CONTRAST
Findings highly concerning for discitis and osteomyelitis 
involving L5 
through S2. Epidural phlegmon and likely abscess at L5-S1 
measuring approximately 1.8 x 0.9 x 2.2 cm (TV by AP by CC) 
(series 3, image 10, series 5, image 36) causes moderate spinal 
canal narrowing. Extensive paravertebral phlegmon and presacral 
fluid collections extend from the inferior aspect of L3-S2 
(series 2, image 13). 

___ TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Normal left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global 
systolic function (LVEF = 60 %). The estimated cardiac index is 
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is 
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets are 
elongated. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a background history of HCV, degenerative joint disease 
of back with sciatica and IVDU, now presenting with a several 
month history of lower back pain, which is progressively 
becoming more severe, MRI showing possible discitis, 
osteomyelitis and epidural abscess.

# Epidural abscess: ___ PRESUMPTIVE
# Discitis/Osteomyelitis
Patient with a background history of IVDU, reporting last use 
several months ago. Progressively worsening back pain over 
several month, with no neurological lower extremity symptoms or 
fevers. Weight loss of ~100lbs over past year. MRI with epidural 
abscess and osteomyelitis involving L3-S2. TTE without evidence 
of vegetation. ___ guided aspiration of 5ml of fluid is now 
growing presumptive ___ species. Infectious disease was 
consulted and recommended further workup including 
reconsultation of the orthospine service for consideration of 
surgical intervention. We also recommended TEE and ophthalmology 
exam given fungal etiology.

Unfortunately, the patient decided to leave the hospital AGAINST 
MEDICAL ADVICE. He understood his medical condition and the 
indications for treatment. He understood the consequences for 
leaving the hospital, including paralysis, severe illness, and 
death. He was able to describe these risks and his own words. He 
was determined to have capacity to leave AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE. 
He was prescribed an ongoing course of fluconazole to minimize 
risk with his ongoing infection. It was explained to the patient 
that we recommend returning to the hospital as soon as possible 
given his severe risk. He should follow-up with PCP and 
infectious disease clinic if he does not re-present to the 
hospital.

Transitional issues:
- Follow-up IV drug use, social work was consulted
- History HCV, viral load undetectable
- Recommend proper treatment of his osteomyelitis with IV 
micafungin at an appropriate medical facility if the patient 
will tolerate this
- Started PO fluconazole to minimize risk, not ideal for this 
infection

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You presented to ___ with a severe infection in your spine.  
We took a sample of the infection and it grew a dangerous 
fungus. We recommended that you stay in the hospital for 
treatment with IV medications and consideration for a surgical 
procedure to fully treat your infection.  You understood our 
suggestions but decided to leave the hospital AGAINST MEDICAL 
ADVICE.  We gave you an oral medication that is not ideal to 
treat your infection.  Therefore, there is a significant risk 
that you will become paralyzed and/or die from your infection.  
We highly recommend that you come back to the hospital as soon 
as he can to get proper treatment. PLEASE FOLLOW-UP WITH 
INFECTIOUS DISEAE IN CLINIC.

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Care Team
