Imaging studies:
Abd US (___)
1. Mildly heterogeneous liver echo-texture, possibly due to 
fatty
infiltration although other causes including hepatitis is not 
excluded, especially given that the prior MR study in ___ 
demonstrated a normal appearing liver.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. 

___:
Findings of chronic necrotizing pancreatitis with a 2.2 x 1.3 cm 
area of walled-off necrosis and hemorrhage in the head/uncinate 
process, numerous other hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic intra- 
and peripancreatic collections, and a dilated pancreatic duct 
with ectatic side branches secondary to a stricture in the 
head/neck. Narrowing of the portal confluence in chronic 
occlusion of the splenic vein with small collateral vessels in 
the splenic hilum. Findings are significantly progressed 
compared to the prior MRCP with secretin from ___.

presented with epigastric/RUQ pain, anorexia and nausea. Her 
admission labs are notable for transaminitis and elevated alk 
phos with normal lipase, MRCP shows chronic necrotizing 
pancreatitis with significant progression relative to last year 
with multiple fluid collections and dilated pancreatic duct 
secondary to stricture. Patient was given pain medication and 
kept NPO with resolution of transaminitis. A nasojejunal tube 
was placed for post-pyloric feedings, which the patient 
tolerated well. She was discharged with pancreatic surgery 
follow-up for consideration of Whipple procedure. 

#Chronic necrotizing pancreatitis
Patient has history of recurrent pancreatitis (on enzyme 
replacement therapy), and presented with epigastric/RUQ pain and 
nausea. Her MRCP during this admission was notable for chronic 
necrotizing pancreatitis with significant progression relative 
to last year. Patient reuired IV dilaudid for pain control. She 
was kept NPO and given IVF, with symptomatic improvement. An NJT 
was paced to enable enteral nutrition. Although the etiology of 
her pancreatitis is unclear, patient is a carrier of CFTR F508 
del and could be a compound heterozygote. She was evaluated by 
the pancreatic surgery team for consideration of Whipple 
procedure. On discharge, patient was tolerating NJT feeds and 
pain was well-controlled on PO oxycodone.

#RUQ pain
#Hepatitis:
Patient presented with RUQ pain, transaminitis and abnormal 
hepatic echotexture on U/S, but no biliary tract abnormalities 
on MRCP, all concerning for acute hepatitis, most likely 
secondary to cholestasis i/s/o acute on chronic pancreatits. 
Hepatitis serologies were all negative (HBsAg, HBs-Ab, Hbc-Ab, 
HAV-Ab, and HCV-Ab) and IgG subclasses were notable for slightly 
reduced IgG1 and IgG2.  Transaminitis quickly downtrended once 
patient was made NPO.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had severe 
abdominal pain and nausea. An imaging study showed some 
additional changes in your pancreas since ___, consistent 
with worsening chronic pancreatitis. Your liver function tests  
were elevated when you first came into the hospital, which was 
likely due to temporary blockage of the ducts that allow bile to 
drain from the liver into your bowels. These labs quickly 
returned to normal once you stopped eating. A feeding tube was 
put in through your nose and into your intestine to deliver 
nutrition past the pancreas, so as not to cause further 
inflammation. You were seen by the pancreas surgery team (Dr. 
___ and they discussed with you that you might benefit from 
an operation to take out the part of your pancreas that is 
unhealthy.

Please keep all of your follow-up appointments and take all your 
medications as prescribed.

It was a pleasure to take care of you while you were a patient 
at ___.

-Your medicine team
