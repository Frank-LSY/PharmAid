History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old woman with a history of metastatic 
papillary thyroid carcinoma s/p xRT who was brought in by her 
children for increasing somnolence, fragility throughout the 
day.

History obtained by daughter. The patient had reportedly just 
returned from  ___ ___ days ago, where she spent 4 weeks 
receiving xRT for metastases to esophagus and spine. Her 
daughter brought her back to her senior living ___, where she 
was beginning to return to her baseline (mRs 3), able to 
interact and
communicate with her friends "sharp as a tack" and only require 
assistance w bathing and preparing meals. Her daughter thought 
she was improving up until about 2 days ago when she suffered a 
fall while using her walker. She fell onto the ground, did not 
lose consciousness, but it did require several assistants to 
help her from the ground. She was in usual state after fall per 
daughter, and played cards with her friends that night. The next 
day she was also in her usual state of health. This morning, she 
"slept through breakfast" and then did not want to wake up. Her 
children finally woke her up and got her out of bed for lunch.

She ate some lunch but then became acutely more tired as well as 
nauseous. EMS was called and she presented to ___ were 
___ showed IVH, transferred to ___ for further workup.

Not on any anti-coagulation, only baby aspirin. No known brain 
metastases from cancer.

IMAGING:
========
Noncontrast CT: Again demonstrated, is a left frontal 
intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with large intraventricular extension, with interval 
redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage into the third 
ventricle and likely layering within the fourth ventricle (2:9). 
There is increased hypoattenuation within the hemorrhage which 
is most consistent with hyperacute blood, considering CTA 
arterial blushing in the corresponding region (02:20). In 
addition, there appears to be new scattered sulcal and 
perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (02:19). 
  
CTA: There is a 5 mm enhancing round lesion at the left frontal 
gray-white 
matter junction which likely represents an aneurysm arising from 
the distal MCA branch, or alternatively may represent a 
enhancing mass although less likely (3: 252). Please note, this 
aneurysm is approximately 1.6 cm from the intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage (3:252). There is arterial blushing (CTA spot sign) 
within the left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage indicating 
active bleeding. 
  
OTHER: 8 mm left apical pulmonary nodule. 1.8 cm round enhancing 

supraclavicular midline mass (3:67). 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
___ year old woman with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma 
with unclear involvement into CNS (thought not although with 
known spine metastases) who suffered significant IVH with 
devastating prognosis. Not a neurosurgical candidate for EVD or 
any intervention per neurosurgical team. No anti-coagulation to 
reverse at this time. Etiology of IVH suspicious for hemorrhagic 
metastasis vs. aneurysm.

Discussed ___ with family at great length. Per daughter, who is 
HCP, would like to focus on comfort at this time. 

Therefore patient was discharged to her apartment with hospice 
care.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
Home with hospice services.

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

AHA/ASA Core Measures for Intracerebral Hemorrhage  
==================================================
1. Dysphagia screening before any PO intake? (x) Yes - () No.  
If no, reason why:  
2. DVT Prophylaxis administered? () Yes - (x) No. If no, why not 
-> comfort measures only
3. Smoking cessation counseling given? () Yes - (x) No [reason 
(x) non-smoker - () unable to participate]  
4. Stroke education (personal modifiable risk factors, how to 
activate EMS for stroke, stroke warning signs and symptoms, 
prescribed medications, need for followup) given in written 
form?
(x) Yes - () No  
5. Assessment for rehabilitation and/or rehab services 
considered? (x) Yes - () No. If no, why not? (I.e. patient at 
baseline functional status)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,  

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of weakness and 
somnolence resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a 
condition where there is bleeding in the brain. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  

 Based on the size of your bleed and lack of available options 
to resolve the problem, the decision was made to focus on 
comfort care only. 

 You were therefore discharged back to your home with hospice 
care.

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Neurology Team
