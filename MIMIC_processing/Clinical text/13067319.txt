IMAGING AND PROCEDURES:

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: ___
FINDINGS: 
 Single vessel coronary artery disease.
 Successul PCI of the 90% mid LAD stenosis with a 3.x 18 DES, 
posted with a 3.25 NC balloon
up to ___ ATM

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM: ___
Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is 
61 % (normal 54-73%). 
IMPRESSION: Normal study. Normal biventricular cavity sizes and 
regional/global biventricular systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified. Normal estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with past medical history of 
dyslipidemia, who presented to the ___ ED after undergoing 
outpatient stress echocardiogram on ___ that revealed 
severe myocardial ischemia in the mid LAD distribution. He 
underwent coronary angiography showing 90% stenosis in the mid 
LAD with successful PCI and placement of one DES in the mid-LAD.

ACUTE ISSUES
# CAD s/p DES to LAD
The patient reported a 3-month history of worsening exertional 
chest pain with family history significant for CAD in a maternal 
uncle at age ___. Cardiac risk factors included dyslipidemia and 
obesity. The patient underwent successful PCI with one DES to 
the mid-LAD for 90% mid-LAD occlusion via right radial access. 
He remained hemodynamically stable without chest pain following 
cath. He was started on goal-directed therapy with aspirin, 
clopidogrel, beta-blocker and high dose atorvastatin. TTE from 
___ revealed normal biventricular cavity sizes and 
regional/global biventricular systolic function.

# Dyslipidemia
Discontinued home fenofibrate. Started on atorvastatin 80mg 
daily.

# URI
Reported upper respiratory symptoms of nasal congestion, no 
cough.
Noted recent contact with his ___ and ___ year old children with 
colds at home. Offered nasal saline spray and phenylephrine as 
needed.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

[ ] Weight at discharge: 227.73 lb (103.3 kg)

[ ] Blood pressure at discharge: 110s/70s-80s

[ ] Heart rate at discharge: 60s-80s

[ ] Should continue dual anti-platelet with ASA 81mg daily and 
clopidogrel 75mg daily for 12 months (from ___

[ ] Noted to have dyslipidemia with Trig elevated to 626. 
Started on atorvastatin 80mg daily. Please monitor and assess 
need for additional medical management.

[ ] ___ consider Lipoprotein(a) testing in the outpatient 
setting considering CAD at relatively young age of ___ with 
significant family history; raising the concern for genetic 
contribution to development of early coronary disease.

[ ] ___ consider referral to Nutritionist to improve weight to 
modify risk for worsening CAD. The patient expressed interest in 
improving his diet.
