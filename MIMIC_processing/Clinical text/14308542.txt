History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with IBS, endometriosis and recent UTI
w/ organisms resistant to all but meropenem and macrobid, s/p 5
day macrobid course, now w/ recurrence of symptoms and slightly
positive UA, admitted to the medicine floor for initiation of IV
meropenem. 

Pt states that she has been suffering from symptoms of dysuria
and pelvic pain for nearly a year and it is significantly
decreasing her quality of life. She states that she completed a
course of Macrobid a few days ago and then today developed 
severe
dysuria with cloudy urine, prompting her to go to urgent care.
There, her UA was slightly positive with small leuks and ___
WBCs and occasional bacteria. She was re-prescribed Macrobid in
addition to AZO for pain control; she took these medications at
5PM. Then, at 11PM, she developed nausea, vomiting and chills 
and
ultimately came to the ___ ED. She is concerned that she will
not be able to take her antibiotics due to the nausea/vomiting.

caused her nausea. She also took her home medications (including
tramadol and gabapentin) and denies prior history of stomach
upset related to the medications.

On further questioning, pt denies fever or flank pain (though 
has
mild lower back MSK strain). She urinates before and after 
sexual
intercourse with her fianc√©. She has been tested for STDs in the
past and all tests were negative.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[ ] Patient will need referral for pelvic physical therapy
[ ] Patient recommended to follow up with infectious disease at

insterstitial cystitis which puts her at increased risk of 
recurrent infection. To consider suppression abx therapy. 
[ ] Patient with significant family h/o autoimmune disorders, 
personal h/o ___ thyroiditis, has had intermittent 
hematuria iso ICS, could potentially consider workup for 
autoimmune etiologies of overarching disease process. 
[ ] Plan to see urology with Dr. ___ expedited f/u of likely 
acute on chronic interstitial cystitis. 
[ ] Despite gabapentin, amitriptyline, tramadol, pain has 
continued to be difficult to control during acute exacerbations 
of likely interstitial cystitis. Recommend continued f/u with 
pain management. 

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=====================
___ h/o endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, recently dx UTI 
with cx positive E. Coli sensitive only to nitrofurantoin and 
meropenem presented with severe dysuria, persistent nausea. 
Initial c/f persistent UTI refractory to course of 
nitrofurantoin, given her sx of dysuria, frequency, urgency, 
however U/A on admission negative for infection. Ultimately felt 
most likely ___ to acute on chronic interstitial cystitis. 
Etiology of acute flare unclear at this time. Renal U/S 
performed was normal, no hydronephrosis. Infectious Disease 
consulted, expressed that there was no indication for 
antibiotics given her bland U/A, lack of fever, continued 
hemodynamic stability, and lack of leukocytosis. Further 
rationale to hold off on unnecessary nitrofurantoin to avoid 
resistance. More recent UCx from ___ positive for E. 
Coli, discussed this result with ID again who again agreed, 
given her bland U/A, that this was likely residual bacteria and 
not representative of active infection. She remained afebrile, 
hemodynamically stable, without any leukocytosis throughout her 
stay. She had vomited once during admission iso nausea and pain. 
Initially had poor po intake, placed on mIVF and given zofran 
with improvement in her nausea. Was able to tolerate regular po 
diet prior to discharge with improvement in her overall 
symptoms.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital due to severe pain on urination, 
significant nausea, and concern for a persistent urinary tract 
infection (UTI). As we discussed, your symptoms certainly 
resembled a UTI, however the urine test and other labs provided 
evidence that you did not have an active infection. While you 
were here, we treated your symptoms of pain and nausea and 
obtained an ultrasound of your kidneys. This ultrasound was 
normal and did not show anything concerning. You had a decreased 
appetite and had vomited so we replaced fluids through your IV. 
Ultimately your symptoms improved and you were ready to leave 
the hospital. You should continue to follow up with your 
outpatient specialists for further evaluation of your symptoms 
as they are likely related to your chronic conditions. Please do 
not hesitate to return to the emergency department if you begin 
having fevers, chills, worsening nausea, vomiting, or pain.

We wish you the best, 
Your ___ Care Team
