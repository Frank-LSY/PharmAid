The patient was in her usual state of health during a run with 
girlfriends at around 8:00am when she developed left lateral 
neck pain, characterized by a small twinge of pain, which she 
often has when exercising.   It was aching in nature, 
non-radiating and improved with manual massage.   Thereafter 
during breakfast with her friend at around 9:00am, she noted 
that her right visual field became blurry or droopy without 
loss of vision or curtain-like sensation.  She noted that the 
changes were noted in the right hemifield of either eye.   She 
then developed scattered shimmering lights in her right field of 
view along with lines across her field of view.  She went home 
and attempted to rest, noting fatigue and generalized weakness,  
as well as a central occipital headache.  The headache was 
aching in nature, ___ in severity, non-radiating, without 
associated photophobia, phonophobia, nausea or vomiting.  She 
took Acetaminophen x2 tablets without significant improvement.   
After notifying her mother and PCPs office, she then developed 
left field of view positive visual phenomena, characterized by 
shimmering lights, large floaters, and moving areas of blurry 
vision.   She also was noted to be intermittently drowsy.  Her 
mother has a history of migraines, but she denies any similar 
headaches like this in the past.

Because of the continued symptoms, she presented to ___ 
___, where she had resolution of visual phenomena by around 
11:30am.  Her headache improved.   She underwent Head CT and 
Head/Neck CTA that showed a reported 3cm left vertebral 
dissection, for which she was transferred by ___ for further 
evaluation and management.   She received NS 1L and Lorazepam 
1mg IV after imaging due to anxiety. 

She endorses ___ headaches in the past month, always resolved 
with acetaminophen, more likely frontal.  They are triggered by 
alcohol or caffeine withdrawal or seasonal allergies.
