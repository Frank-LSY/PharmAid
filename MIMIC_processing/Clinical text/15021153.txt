Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
left partial nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events 
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. The 
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient 
ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, JP and urethral Foley 
catheter were removed without difficulty and diet was advanced 
as tolerated. The remainder of the hospital course was 
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable 
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding 
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On 
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit 
instructions to follow-up in clinic in approximately four weeks 
time.
