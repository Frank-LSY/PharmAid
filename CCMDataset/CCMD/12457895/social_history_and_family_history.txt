Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service 
after undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral 
salpingectomy for symptomatic fibroid uterus. Please see the 
operative report for full details.
Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately 
post-op, her pain was controlled with IV toradol and IV 
dilaudid.
On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her 
foley was removed and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to PO 
oxycodone, Tylenol, and ibuprofen.
By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.
