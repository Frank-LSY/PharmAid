Admission physical exam:
Vitals: T97.9F, HR 103, BP 154/91, RR 16, O2 100% RA

General: Awake, overweight woman, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no nuchal rigidity. Negative Kernig and Brudzinski
tests. 
Pulmonary: breathing non labored on room air 
Cardiac: warm and well perfused; regular on telemetry
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema bilaterally
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Awake, alert, oriented to self, place, time and
situation. Able to relate history without difficulty. Attentive,
able to name ___ backward without difficulty. Language is fluent
with intact repetition and comprehension. Normal prosody. There
were no paraphasic errors. Pt was able to name both high and low
frequency objects.  Able to read without difficulty. Speech was
not dysarthric. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands. The pt had good knowledge of current events. There was
no evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 4mm to 2mm and brisk. VFF to confrontation via finger
wiggling, including testing with either eye individually. On
fundoscopic exam, disc margins were very difficult to visualize
and blurred, likely papilledema. 
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus. Normal saccades.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally. No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. 
No
asterixis noted.

-Sensory: 
*Pinprick: Diminished in the left hemiface, where V1-2 sensation
is 75% of normal and V3 is 50% of normal. Does not split the
midline. On pinprick testing of the left arm, sensation is 75% 
of
normal circumferentially extending from the neck to the hand; no
sensory loss in the hand.

the left face and arm 
No extinction to DSS.

-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.

-Gait: Good initiation. Narrow-based, normal stride and arm
swing.  Able to walk in tandem without difficulty. Romberg
absent.
