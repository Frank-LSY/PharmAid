-Sensory: Reduced magnitude of pinprick sensation to 80-90% of 
normal circumferentially in R arm from the level of elbow 
distally, and in R leg from the level of the distal thigh 
distally circumferentially. Proprioception is preserved in right 
index finger, and reduced to small amplitude movements in right 
great toe. No extinction to DSS.

bilaterally. No dysmetria on FNF bilaterally.

DISCHARGE EXAM:

Vitals:  Temp: 98.1 (Tm 98.3), BP: 106/61 (106-132/61-72), HR: 
60
(60-73), RR: 18, O2 sat: 97% (96-100)  

Exam
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: No nuchal rigidity.
Pulmonary: Normal work of breathing.
Cardiac: Warm, well-perfused.
Extremities: No ___ edema.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
 
Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history
without any difficulty. Attentive to examiner. Language is 
fluent
with intact repetition and comprehension. Normal prosody and no
paraphasic errors. Pt was able to name both high and low
frequency objects. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands. There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect. Memory
impaired, with ___ registration and ___ recall initially, with
___ recalled with cue and the remaining ___ with multiple 
choice.

-Cranial Nerves:
PERRL. EOMI without nystagmus. Facial sensation intact to light
touch. Face symmetric at rest and with activation. Hearing 
intact
to conversation, although notably impaired on the left. Unable 
to
hear finger-rub bilaterally. Palate elevates symmetrically. ___
strength in trapezii bilaterally. Tongue protrudes in midline
with good movement bilaterally. 

-Motor: Somewhat decreased bulk throughout, consistent with age.
Pronator drift in RUE. ___ strength in RLE. Otherwise, full
strength throughout. 

-Sensory: Sensation to light touch impaired in right upper and
lower extremity compared to the left. No extinction to DSS. 

-DTRs: ___

-___: No intention tremor. Patient struggled with FN on
right, but questionable for weakness vs incoordination as cause.

-Gait: Deferred.
