Temperature: 97.8
Blood pressure: 149/98

Oxygen saturation: 95% 

General physical examination: 
General: Comfortable and in no distress 
Head: No irritation/exudate from eyes, nose, throat 
Neck: Supple with no pain to flexion or extension 
Cardio: Regular rate and rhythm, warm, no peripheral edema 
Lungs: Unlabored breathing 
Abdomen: Soft, non tender, non distended 
Skin: No rashes or lesions

Mental status: 
Patient alert, crying, appears very frustrated and confused. 
Patient is trying to communicate, but examiner cannot understand

facial droop.  Hearing intact.  Patient will not open mouth. 
Shoulders sit symmetrically. 

Motor examination: 
Patient will not comply for formal examination.  Patient's left
side of the body is strongly antigravity.  Patient's right arm
when lifted at the shoulder quickly falls back the bed.  Patient
with antigravity ability to flex at elbow. Patient with right
wrist drop and her fingers are held in flexion.  Of note, the
movement of the right upper extremity is greatly improved from
initial presentation when it appeared densely plegic.  Patient's
right lower extremity is strongly antigravity.    

Sensation: 
Patient signals that she appreciates sensation of crude touch in
upper and lower extremities.  Patient without tactile neglect. 

Coordination:
Could not assess 

Reflexes:
