Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a hx of HTN and recently diagnosed CAD 
s/p DES to pLAD for management of a 95% hazy stenosis on 
___ after presenting with NSTEMI, who re-presented two 
days after discharge with recurrent right-sided chest pain. His 
troponin values were stable from discharge two days prior at 
0.54 and 0.56. EKG was also unchanged on admission. He underwent 
nuclear stress testing which was negative and specifically 
showed (1) left ventricular cavity size is normal; (2) resting 
and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium. His chest pain 
subsided and he was discharged pain free, with instructions to 
continue all of his home medications. He was also discharged 
with a lidocaine patch which he felt improved his back pain.
