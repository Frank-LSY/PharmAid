PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
Vitals: T: 97.9   HR: 63   BP: 137/69   RR: 16   SaO2:100%
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx. No tenderness at stylomastoid foramen. 
Neck: Supple. No nuchal rigidity.
Pulmonary: Normal work of breathing.
Cardiac: Warm, well-perfused.
Abdomen: Soft, non-distended.
Extremities: No ___ edema.
Skin: No rashes or lesions noted initially. Developed urticaria
after IV contrast.
 
Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history
without difficulty. Attentive answering detailed questions 
during
interview. Language is fluent with intact repetition and
comprehension. Normal prosody, though speech slowed compared to
her baseline (per son). There were no paraphasic errors. Able to
name both high and low frequency objects.  Able to read without
difficulty. No dysarthria. Able to follow both midline and
appendicular commands. There was no evidence of apraxia or
neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 4 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI without
nystagmus. VFF to confrontation. Fundoscopic exam revealed no
papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
V: Facial sensation decreased to light touch and temperature 
(%75
of normal) on right hemiface, mostly over cheek (V2>V3>V1) ~1cm
to the right of midline. Muscles of mastication full strength. 
VII: Mild right lower facial droop. 
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally. Weber localizes
to left ear prominently and repeatedly. ___ normal 
bilaterally.
(Suggesting right ear sensorineural loss.)
IX, X: Unable to visualize palate. 
XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with good excursions. Strength
full with tongue-in-cheek testing.

-Motor: Normal bulk and tone throughout. No pronator drift. No
adventitious movements, such as tremor or asterixis noted.

-Sensory: Deficits to light touch and temperature in right face
and scalp as noted above. Also decreased in ~10cm area at crown
of scalp. No deficits to light touch, pinprick, or temperature
elsewhere, including in right hand.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

-Coordination: No intention tremor. Normal finger-tap
bilaterally. No dysmetria on FNF.

-Gait: Deferred.
