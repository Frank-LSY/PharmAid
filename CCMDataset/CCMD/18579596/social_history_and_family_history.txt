.
Patient's presentation appeared most consistent with major 
depressive disorder and ___ anxiety disorder, With 
moderate or severe use disorder. Ms. ___ reported amotivation, 
anergia, poor mood, anhedonia and suicidal thoughts which could 
be a manifestation of heavy marijuana use though on history and 
collateral, it appeared that Ms. ___ reports a similar decline 
in functioning and worsening of mood symptoms at this time last 
year regardless of substance use. This suggested a potential 
recurrence of a primary mood disorder. Ms. ___ acknowledged a 
history of trauma. At this time the specificity and timing 
(___?) is unclear though this could be associated with 
cyclical decompensation in mood. In regard to Ms. ___ anxiety 
symptoms she acknowledged difficulty falling asleep due to 
ruminations and racing thoughts. This occurred despite and 
perhaps secondary to heavy marijuana use. She reported self 
treating her escalating anxiety symptoms during the day with

for vacation in ___. We discussed with Ms. ___ regarding 
the association between her anxiety and heavy marijuana use 
including exacerbation of her underlying anxiety disorder as 
well interfering with the effectiveness of her psychiatric 
medications. We encouraged the patient to continue to abstain 
from use after discharge.

project groups. She reported and overall reduction in anxiety 
and improvement in mood. This she attributed to the clonidine.

ideation and fair insight and good judgment. She was future 
oriented and reported good social support, outpatient psychiatry 
___ and was able to self identify safety resources if she 
experiences a recurrence of suicidal ideation or increasing 
hopelessness.
