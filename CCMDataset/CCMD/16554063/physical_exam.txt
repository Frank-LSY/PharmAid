bilaterally. No facial movement asymmetry. Hearing intact to
finger rub bilaterally.  Palate elevation symmetric. SCM

The leg testing above was when supine and tested with straight
leg raise. Did appear stronger when flexing at the knee. Some
give way especially at bilateral TAs due to ankle pain.

Brisk reflexes, symmetric, possible mild crossed adductor
bilaterally.
Plantar response extensor on the left, flexor on the right. 

Sensory: Decreased light touch on the left but still senses the
light touch. No extinction to DSS. Decreased PP over the left
leg. Able to sense upwards v downwards stroking of the skin in
all four extremities. Inaccurate with touching a spot on the 
skin
with eyes closed - worse with left hand compared to right. 

Coordination: Slowed finger/nose/finger but no dysmetria
bilaterally. Slowed RAM but not clumsy. HKS intact on the right
but on the left, she brought her foot close to her leg but did
not put it on her knee despite encouragement because "I don't
know where my foot is". Unsure if left hip replacement played a
role in this difficulty.

Gait: Stood with some assistance and felt lightheaded, could
not put her feet together - unsteady. Deferred the rest of gait.
