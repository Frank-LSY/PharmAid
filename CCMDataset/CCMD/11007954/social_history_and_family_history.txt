Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ G2 P0 who presented
to labor and delivery at 41 weeks for a postdates induction
of labor and a diagnosis of chronic hypertension.  The
patient was admitted with an unfavorable cervix and  was induced
with Cytotec and Pitocin.  During her labor course, she
progressed to 5 cm with spontaneous rupture of membranes at
approximately 2 a.m. on the day of surgery. She failed to make
any cervical change for 10 hours on Pitocin, had an IUPC
placed that demonstrated inadequate contractions. Additionally, 
she was noted to have blood-tinged urine and severe range blood
pressures with systolics in the 180s and diastolics in the
80-120s. Given these concerning developments, she underwent an
evaluation of superimposed preeclampsia with severe features.
Laboratory analysis confirmed the diagnosis with an elevation in
her creatinine from 0.6 baseline, on admission to the hospital,
to 1.2 on the morning prior to surgery. We discussed the
diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features and the
recommendation for magnesium as well as expediting delivery.
Given her stalled labor, cesarean section was discussed.  We
discussed the risks of surgery including bleeding, infection,
injury to surrounding organs, including bowel, bladder, blood
vessels, ureters, nerves, and fetus as well as blood clots, the
risk of blood transfusion, and the risk of hysterectomy and very
rarely death.  We discussed the need for a possible repair of 
any
injuries and subsequent surgeries to do so.  We reviewed that we
could attempt to continue trying to get her into labor; however,
after 10 hours of no cervical change on Pitocin with ruptured
membranes at 5 cm, we discussed that it was unlikely that she
would progress quickly and that her preeclampsia may
worsen and her kidney injury may be exacerbated prior to the
delivery. Given all of this, the patient agreed to a cesarean
delivery.
