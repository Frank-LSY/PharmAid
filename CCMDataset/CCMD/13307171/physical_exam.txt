lymphadenopathy, cone of light seen in bilateral tympanic
membranes
___: RRR, no M/R/G
Pulmonary: CTAB, no crackles or wheezes
Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no guarding

Neurologic Examination:
- Mental status: Awake, alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate
history without difficulty. Attentive, Speech is fluent with 
full
sentences, intact repetition, and intact verbal comprehension. 
No
paraphasias.  No dysarthria. Normal prosody. No apraxia. No

follow
both midline and appendicular commands.

- Cranial Nerves: PERRL 3->2 brisk. VF full to number counting.
EOMI, L beating nystagmus with rotatory component when looking 
to
the L and up and down but not just horizontal (worse looking up
than looking down), R beating nystagmus when looking to the 
right
in horizontal gaze, R beating nystagmus with torsional component
when looking to the right and up. No skew. Head impulse test
difficult to interpret as pt refixates when turning head to
either side. V1-V3 without deficits to light touch bilaterally.
No facial movement asymmetry. Hearing intact to finger rub
bilaterally. Palate elevation symmetric. SCM/Trapezius strength
___ bilaterally. Tongue midline.

- Sensory: No deficits to light touch or pin prick throughout.

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing
bilaterally but has a subtle dysmetria on HKS on the L. Very 
slow
with finger tapping on the left compared to the right out of
proportion to what is expected in a right handed person.
+cerebellar rebound on the left. Subtle overshoot on the L when
compared to the R on mirror testing. No truncal ataxia.

- Gait: Normal initiation. Narrow base. Normal stride length and
arm swing. Stable without sway. Negative Romberg.

=== DISCHARGE EXAM ===
Essentially normal, except minimal direction-changing nystagmus 
on horizontal gaze. No lateralizing cerebellar signs. No skew, 
negative head impulse. Normal gait, negative Romberg. Also, mild 
loss of sensation to pinprick on feet up to mid-calf, but 
proprioception and vibration fully intact.
