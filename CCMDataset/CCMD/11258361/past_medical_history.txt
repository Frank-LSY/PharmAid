PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (per OMR):
 - Presented with monoclonal IgG gammopathy, which was noted
during his workup for PMR.  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
revealed 20% plasma cells by CD138 staining.  He is noted for an
elevated monoclonal protein at 1300 mg/dL of IgG kappa with
depression of his IgA and IgM.  He also had a monoclonal protein
in his urine and a suspicious lytic lesion in his skeletal 
survey
within the humerus.  
 - Started on thalidomide on ___.  On follow up
evaluation, on ___, noted for a drop in his sodium to 123
and his thalidomide was placed on hold.  
 - With persistent low sodium, admitted to ___ for
further evaluation.  Placed on a fluid restriction diet and
decreased alcohol intake and his sodium has recovered.
 - Restarted thalidomide on ___ with increasing doses up
to 150 mg daily by ___.  This was discontinued on
___ as his IgG free light chain and SPEP plateaued.
 - Received two cycles of Velcade and dexamethasone with the
first cycle on ___ and his second cycle on ___. 
Treatment was complicated by increasing diarrhea and some nausea
and vomiting but with good response to therapy.  
 - Restaging by bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on ___,
which showed plasma cells comprising less than 5% of marrow core
cellularity.  Now being followed over time with his treatment
currently on hold.  He receives Zometa every 3 - 4 months.
 - Admission at ___ from ___ to ___ 
with
abdominal pain and cramping and bright red blood per rectum.  No
infectious etiology and biopsies taken on colonoscopy showed
ischemic colitis although the etiology of this was unclear. 
 - Slow rise in myeloma parameters.  Repeat bone marrow biopsy 
on
___ with no evidence of myeloma, and on ___ showed
plasma cells are 4% of the aspirate differential and
approximately 5% by CD138 immunostaining of the core biopsy,
occurring singly and in occasional clusters.  By immunoglobulin
light chain staining for kappa and lambda, clonality is 
difficult
to reliably assess due to low numbers.  Possibility of minimal
involvement by patient's known plasma cell dyscrasia cannot be
excluded. 
 - ___, repeat bone marrow biopsy showed increasing plasma
cells to 30 % involvement by CD138 staining. 
 - Early ___, presented to ___ and admitted with
bowel obstruction; underwent exploratory laparotomy with noted
adhesions from prior hernia surgery as well as fat wrapped 
around
his bowels causing the obstruction.  Recovered with no further
issues.  
 - ___, started treatment with Velcade 1 mg/m2 SQ weekly
with Decadron for 3 weeks.
 - ___, C2 Velcade/Decadron weekly for 3 weeks. Dose of
Velcade increased to 1.3 mg/m2 on D 15.
 - ___, C3 Velcade/Decadron 1.3 mg/m2 SQ given on 1, 4, 8,
11 schedule.
 - ___, C4 Velcade/Decadron 1.3 mg/m2 SQ given on 1, 4, 8,
11 schedule (D 11 not given as developed diarrhea).
 - ___ of D 11 treatment), seen at ___
EW for evaluation of diarrhea.  Lab work unremarkable.  EKG
normal and received IVF's.  Symptoms completely resolved with no
further abdominal pain or diarrhea.  Noted for increased Amylase
and Lipase and evaluated by Gastroenterology with improvement
over time.
 - ___, restarted Velcade/Decadron on D1, D8 and D 15
schedule.  Continues on this schedule. 
 - ___, treatment on hold while evaluating GI symptoms. 
Evaluated by GI.  CT scan did not show any abnormalities.  Was
not able to get colonoscopy but symptoms improved.
 - ___, restarted treatment with Velcade/Decadron on D1,
D8, and D15.   
 - ___, treatment on hold again as wife became ill with
probable massive stroke and passed away in mid ___.
 - ___, hyponatremia and evaluated by Dr. ___ renal;
felt related to drinking too much water.
 - ___, restarted treatment with Velcade/Decadron on D1,
D8, D15. D8, D15 given at ___ with Dr. ___. 
 - ___, treatment on hold for ~ 1 month due to GI illness;
restarted on ___.
 - ___, restarted treatment with Velcade on D1, 4, 8, 11
schedule as FK increasing over time.  Treatment now every 3
weeks. 
 - ___, Switch back to Velcade D 1, 8, 15 schedule with
increasing stomach issues.  Not able to tolerate Velcade with
ongoing stomach issues. 
 - ___, Started on low dose Revlmid 5 mg daily.  Developed
a rash after 1 week on treatment and Revlimid on hold as of
___.  Started on treatment dose of Valtrex given concern
for Zoster.
 - ___, Seen by dermatology and biopsy done.
