ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: no scleral icterus, MMM, no oropharyngeal lesions. 
Pulmonary: Breathing comfortably, no tachypnea nor increased WOB
Cardiac: Skin warm, well-perfused. 
Abdomen: soft, ND
Extremities: Symmetric, no edema. 

Neurologic Examination:
- Mental status: Awake, alert, oriented to self only.  When 
asked
location he says in ___ when asked what type of building 
he
is and he says "a temporary building"; he chooses hospital with
when given choices and when asked which hospital says "___.

subtraction of threes from 20, he says "17, 14, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7,
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1".  Speech is fluent, however appears to have
intermittent word finding difficulty when asked open-ended
questions.  Naming intact to low frequency words, including
stroke card, with the exception of saying that the feather 
"looks
like a cigar" though he stated that he did not have his glasses
and was having trouble seeing the card.  Follows complex
cross-body appendicular commands, follows 2 step reverse-order
commands.  Repeats 5 word phrases, but not grammatically complex
phrases.

-Cranial Nerves: PERRL 3->2.5. VFF to confrontation. EOMI 
without
nystagmus. Facial sensation intact to light touch.  Left lower
facial droop. Hearing intact to loud conversation. Palate
elevates symmetrically. ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes in midline and moves briskly to each side.

- Motor:  Normal bulk.  Significant paratonia throughout.  No
drift.  Bilateral action tremor.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.
*3 beats of clonus bilateral knees.  Please reflexes are
difficult to elicit because patient has significant paratonia 
and
will not allow passive movement of the ankle.  

-Sensory:  Intact to LT, temperature throughout.  Unable to
assess proprioception at the toes due to marked bunions and
overlapping toes.  When her perception testing is attempted at
the ankles, patient has significant paratonia and will not allow
the examiner to passively move the ankle.

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing
bilaterally. 

- Gait: When patient stands at edge of bed he is unsteady, when
he takes one step forward he immediately falls backwards onto 
the
bed.
