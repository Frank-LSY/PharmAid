See POP-Q below.  The vaginal apex is quite thin.  There is what
looks like an Ethibond suture eroded in the right vaginal vault
the area around of which is friable.  The patient has some
tenderness.  On bimanual exam, there are no pelvic masses noted. 

No tenderness or masses in the anus and perineum either.  The
Ethibond sutures at the right vaginal vault were cut and we
removed three pieces of suture with the length varying from 2 cm
to 4 cm.  Silver nitrate was applied at that area.  Hemostasis
was good.  The patient tolerated the suture removal well.  On
bimanual exam, the anterior mesh was palpated.  No mesh erosion
was visualized.
