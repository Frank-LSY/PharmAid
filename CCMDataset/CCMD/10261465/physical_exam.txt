ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Vitals:  
97.8 80 176/80 18 
100% RA 
General:  NAD
HEENT: NCAT.  Exquisitely tender at the left splenius.  
Palpation
induces a radicular shooting on the left posterior aspect of her
head which duplicates her headache per reports.   Left
submandibular tender lymphadenopathy.
___: RRR
Pulmonary: CTAB
Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND
Extremities: Warm, no edema

Neurologic Examination:

Vestibular evaluation extremely limited secondary to patient
cooperation.

- Mental status: Awake, alert. Able to relate history in 
___.
Attentive to examiner. Speech is fluent with full sentences, 
repetition and intact verbal comprehension. Naming intact  in
___.  No dysarthria. Normal prosody. No apraxia. No evidence
of hemineglect. No left-right confusion. Able to follow both
midline and appendicular commands.

- Cranial Nerves: PERRL 3->2 brisk. VF full to number counting.
EOMI, no nystagmus.  No skew.  There is questionable overshoot
with head thrust to the left.   V1-V3 without deficits to light
touch bilaterally. No facial movement asymmetry. Hearing intact
to finger rub bilaterally and Weber.  Does not keep eyes open
during attempts to assess vestibular system.  Palate elevation
symmetric. Trapezius strength ___ bilaterally. Tongue midline.

While standing with me, at one point she states she becomes
acutely "dizzy".  This lasts ___ minutes.  Exam is extremely
limited as she keeps her eyes closed except for brief periods of
time.  At times during this, left eye may transiently deviate
out.

- Motor:  Normal bulk and tone. No drift. No tremor or 
asterixis.

*Initially, she states she cannot move the right leg off the bed
and left lower extremity at all.  With significant coaching, it
becomes obvious that the left limb is pain limited due to knee
and hip pain on the left but is otherwise fully strong.  With
mild coaching, the right leg moves easily.  During the interview
she is seen spontaneously moving the legs in bed without any
significant difficulty.

Plantar response flexor bilaterally 

- Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pin, throughout. 
Proprioception intact to median movements.  No extinction to 
DSS.

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing
bilaterally. Good speed and intact cadence with rapid 
alternating
movements.  Does not cooperate with heel shin.

- Gait: Able to stand and is quite steady.  While standing
developed her typical left shooting headache, and must sit down.
