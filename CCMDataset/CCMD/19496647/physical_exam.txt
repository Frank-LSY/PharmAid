ADMISSION EXAM
==============
VS T: 98.7 HR: 83 BP: 146/83 RR: 16 SaO2: 94% RA 
 - General/Constitutional: Sitting up elderly woman swearing and
saying she wants to go home frustrated but non-toxic appearing
HEENT: NCAT, no oropharyngeal lesions, neck supple  
___: RRR, no M/R/G  
Pulmonary: no increased WOB
Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no guarding  
Extremities: Warm, no edema  

Neurologic Examination:  
MS: Awake, alert. Very hard of hearing (per family nearly
completely deaf). Agitated, taking blankets off and trying to 
get
up and out of bed. Saying "I don't like you and I don't like you
and I don't like you" (going around the room and pointing at 
each
person) "I don't want to know who you are," (when RN introduces
self) "I don't want any of these," and "I want to go home," and
swearing. Repetition grossly intact (repeats "your name" a few
times when examiner repeatedly very loudly asks her name but 
does
not say her own name). Will eventually squeeze examiner's hand
with her left hand to command and close eyes (when demonstrating
repeatedly by examiner and daughter), eventually with
demonstrating will mimic and keep extremities up but further
strength testing limited. Withdraws all 4 to touch including 
when
stimulating both sides simultaneously. 
 
Cranial Nerves - PERRL 1 to 0.5 bilaterally. Responds to visual
stimuli in all quadrants, tracks faces. Pulls head away to light
touch of face. Right lower face slower to activate and 
incomplete
activation. Hearing quite impaired (as above, does once repeat
one or two words). Will not protrude tongue to command.  

Motor - No drift appreciated (with demonstrating and
encouragement eventually get patient to keep UE bilaterally up
for 10 seconds each). No tremor or asterixis appreciated. 
Patient
is able to sit herself up and move around in bed, scoot forward,
briskly and strongly withdraw both UE when ___ team trying to
place IV, at least AG at the IPs, quads, hamstrings, and TAs
bilaterally.   
Sensory - As above, withdraws bilateral UE and ___ to light touch
including when stimulating both sides at once (no obvious
extinction to DSS though with eyes open - could not get patient
to participate in dedicated testing of sensation so obtained
observationally)  

DTRs:  
     [Bic] [Tri] [___] [Quad] 
     L  2+    2+     2+      1+

Plantar response flexor bilaterally.  

Coordination - No dysmetria with reaching for blankets or IVs or
crossing and uncrossing ankles.
