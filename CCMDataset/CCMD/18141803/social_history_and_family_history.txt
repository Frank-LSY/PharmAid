IMAGING:
___ EKG: Sinus bradycardia. Borderline P-R interval

___ Chest x-ray:  
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Bilateral low lung volumes are 
noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings; however, there 
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Two linear 
radio-densities overlying the right upper lung likely are 
external to the patient. Interstitial prominance of uncertain 
significance.
