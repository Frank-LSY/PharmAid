about it, a little around the mouth"). [VII] L NLFF at rest with
decreased activation. Strong eye closure and good frontalis
activation bilaterally. [VIII] Hearing intact to voice. [IX, X]
Palate elevation symmetric. No dysarthria. [XI] SCM/Trapezius
strength ___ bilaterally. [XII] Tongue midline with full ROM.
