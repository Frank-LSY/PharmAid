bilaterally. No facial movement asymmetry. Hearing intact to

- Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pin, or proprioception
bilaterally.  No extinction to DSS. 
While testing for pronation drift, patient closed her eyes and
immediately fell backwards while sitting.  When asked what does
she feel she refers "just feels like someone is pushing me and I
have to fall"

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing
bilaterally.  Patient has some initial trouble with rapid
alternating movements but corrected herself and was able to
perform right afterwards.

 - Gait: Patient is able to stand up and give a few steps, 
normal
based, good initiation but as soon as she stops she sways
backwards falls.  She would then continue walking holding onto
things but again, if she stops she would fall to one side or the
other mostly backwards.  Patient attempted to do tandem walk but
after the first step she fell to the side and had to hold 
herself
to prevent a fall.  Patient seemed very frustrated about this. 
Romberg positive.

Plantar response flexor bilaterally 

- Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pin, vibration, or 
proprioception
bilaterally.  No extinction to DSS. 

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing
bilaterally, however she is slower with finger tapping with the 
R. She also undershoots on mirroring testing.  Patient has some 
initial trouble with rapid and is slightly slower on the R. 

 - Gait: Patient is able to stand up and give a few steps, 
narrow based, good initiation but as soon as she stops she sways 
and
backwards falls without warning.
