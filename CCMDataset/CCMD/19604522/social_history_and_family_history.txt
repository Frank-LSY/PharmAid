Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission.  She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Concern for early psychosis
Patient reported a history of experiencing a few incidents of 
hallucinations (seeing her boyfriend's computer screen moving), 
paranoia (believing others were talking about her), and 
temporary delusions (believing others believed she was a ___ 
___) as well as increasing nonspecific cognitive 
difficulties such as memory difficulty (going to work on the 
wrong day). These experiences had been distressing to the 
patient and she was concerned she was developing schizophrenia. 
On further history after admission, it seems most of the 
aforementioned psychotic symptoms occurred either in the setting 
of marijuana intoxication or acute anxiety and/or panic. There 
were no further episodes of overt psychotic symptoms throughout 
her hospital course, although she frequently demonstrated odd 
thought form and heightened suggestibility which were more 
apparent when she was acutely anxious (e.g. apologizing for 
having O2 sat <100%, experiencing nausea when interviewer asks 
if she is nauseous). She did not demonstrate any negative 
symptoms of schizophrenia. To further evaluate for possible 
early psychosis, she received cognitive testing and 
psychological testing. On cognitive testing with MOCA and MMSE 
her scores were within normal limits, although at times she lost 
points due to performance anxiety. On psychological testing, she 
scored abnormally in anxiety scales but not in psychosis scales. 
Overall, diagnostically the psychotic symptoms and thought 
disorder seemed most consistent with cannabis-induced psychotic 
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (with cognitive 
distortion), and possible panic disorder. We started low dose 
risperidone 0.5mg BID for thought disorder and lability and 
increased it to 0.5mg AM, 0.5mg ___, and 1mg QHS which was 
tolerated well and seemed to improve her thinking. Due to 
patient's inconsistent medication compliance, we switched to 
paliperidone 3mg daily prior to discharge. We also focused on 
treating her anxiety as described below. At the time of 
discharge, patient demonstrated linear thought process and 
denied hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. Outpatient 
treaters should monitor for recurrent psychotic symptoms, 
worsening cognitive difficulties, and medication side effects. 
Please reassess need for antipsychotics and consider 
discontinuation if no longer necessary.
.
#) Anxiety/panic symptoms
Patient reported escalating symptoms of anxiety and episodes of 
severe anxiety for past several weeks including feeling tense, 
intrusive thoughts, worrying, restlessness, insomnia, racing 
heart, and shortness of breath. Collateral also noted concern 
for worsening anxiety. Her anxiety was labile but occurred 
appropriate to conversation content/circumstances, and had a 
strong somatic component (patient was noted to be flushed and 
tachycardic when anxious). Interventions included switching from 
wellbutrin to SSRI for chronic anxiety treatment, paliperidone 
for short term anxiety relief (in addition to reasons described 
above), and PRN lorazepam to use as needed. Because patient was 
naÃ¯ve to SSRIs and her mother had good response to citalopram, 
we started citalopram 10mg daily which she tolerated well. 
Patient's anxiety improved somewhat over the course of the 
hospitalization and on the day of discharge patient reports her 
anxiety was manageable. We increased citalopram to 20mg daily 
upon discharge, which can be further titrated by outpatient 
treaters. We discharged also on paliperidone 3mg and a short 
course of lorazepam 0.5mg daily PRN acute anxiety/panic. If 
beneficial or if patient is having recurrent episodes of panic, 
outpatient treaters could consider prescribing additional 
benzodiazepines or non-benzo anxiolytics. 
.
3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Alcohol use disorder- patient reports a history of binge 
drinking when back in ___. She would drink 5 or more vodka 
beverages approximately monthly and has blacked out on multiple 
occasions. Currently, she drinks once per week in social 
situations, typically 1 mixed drink and 2 beers. Counseled 
patient about alcohol use and she expressed interest in cutting 
down.
.
#) Cannabis use disorder- patient reports escalating marijuana 
use, currently ___ weekly via dab pen and vaporizer. She 
reports recent incidents of distressing hallucinations and 
paranoia in the setting of being both high and drunk. It is 
unclear to what extent marijuana may also be contributing to 
other psychotic, cognitive, and mood symptoms. Strongly advised 
patient to abstain from marijuana and all other substances as 
this may worsen her symptoms or precipitate psychosis especially 
if she is predisposed to primary psychotic disorder (family 
history is unknown as patient's mother was adopted). She 
expressed her intention to avoid drugs in the future.
.
4. MEDICAL
#) Tachycardia, chest pain
At the time of admission patient developed acute anxiety, vague 
chest pain and shortness of breath, and tachycardia of 130s to 
144, with normal O2 sat. Initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia 
with changes concerning for myocardial ischemia. HR subsequently 
returned to ___ anxiety improved. Cardiac enzymes, 
D-dimer, TSH, and electrolytes were obtained which were normal 
except for sodium of 133, which was normal on recheck. 
Subsequent ECGs continued to show NSR with a question of peaked 
T waves. Medical consult was obtained which did not recommend 
further workup or management and did not think T waves were 
truly peaked. Over the hospital course, patient's HR generally 
remained in ___ although she continued to have intermittent 
tachycardia to 120s-130s when anxious. We anticipate that her 
tachycardia will improve with treatment of her anxiety and 
panic. If she has further episodes of chest pain we encouraged 
her to seek medical care immediately.
.
#) Influenza exposure
Patient shared a room with another patient who was diagnosed 
with influenza A on ___. Patient was asymptomatic and tested 
negative by nasopharyngeal swab influenza A/B PCR. We offered 
prophylactic Tamiflu which patient took for 5 days. At the time 
of discharge, patient continued to deny flu-like symptoms and 
Tamiflu was discontinued. 
.
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient frequently attended these groups that focused on 
teaching patients various coping skills. Patient was frequently 
noted to be anxious but was pleasant, engaged, cooperative, and 
made relevant contributions. Patient was often visible in milieu 
socializing appropriately with similarly aged peers, and she 
again was intermittently noted to be anxious.
.
#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
-Patient's mother ___ (___) was contacted at 
several points during patient's admission for collateral and 
treatment planning. 
-Gathered collateral from patient's boyfriend ___ 
(___).
.
#) ___
- Medications: discontinued home bupropion, started 
paliperidone, started citalopram, started lorazepam PRN anxiety
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: arranged followup with outpatient 
providers, arranged ___ appointment with school
- Behavioral Interventions: encouraged DBT skills, coping skills
- Guardianships: n/a
.
INFORMED CONSENT: Paliperidone, Citalopram
The team discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, 
and possible side effects and risks of starting this medication, 
and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medication, with this patient. We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any questions about medications 
with the treatment team. The patient appeared able to understand 
and consented to begin the medication.
.
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based on history concerning 
for psychotic symptoms and disorganized and unpredictable 
behavior such as running out into the snow locking herself out. 
Their static risk factors noted at that time included history of 
abuse, history of substance abuse, Caucasian ethnicity, and age. 
The modifiable risk factors included psychosis, disorganized and 
unpredictable behavior, hopelessness, no established outpatient 
treatment, insomnia, active substance abuse/intoxication, and 
impulsivity. These were addressed through individual and group 
therapy and psychopharmacologic management, with subsequent 
improvement in all modifiable risk factors. Finally, the patient 
is being discharged with many protective risk factors, including 
help-seeking nature, future-oriented viewpoint, good social 
support, sense of responsibility to family, no 
irritability/agitation, reality testing ability, good coping 
skills, good problem-solving skills, and lack of suicidal 
ideation. Patient demonstrated preserved capacity to engage in a 
meaningful discussion about safety planning about what she would 
do in the event of worsening psychiatric symptoms (e.g. would 
call therapist, call ___, or self-present to the ED). Overall, 
based on the totality of our assessment at this time, the 
patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others.
