RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
expressed suicidal ideation. Their static factors noted at that 
time include single marital status. The modifiable risk factors 
were also addressed at that time, including lack of outpatient 
providers (was referred to psychiatric prescriber to continue 
antidepressant medication).  Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective risk factors, including future 
oriented thought content, willingness to follow up with 
outpatient providers, willingness to continue antidepressant 
medication, and lack of ongoing suicidal ideation or 
thoughts/urges to engage in self-harm. Patient also demonstrated 
preserved capacity to engage in a meaningful conversation about 
safety planning and what she would do if thoughts of suicide 
returned (e.g. patient would contact student health services, 
call ___, or come to the emergency department). Overall, at time 
of discharge, patient no longer required acute inpatient 
admission for decompensated symptoms of mental illness.
