FSG 100

General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx
Neck: Supple, No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W
Cardiac: RRR, nl. 
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND
Extremities: No ___ edema.
Skin: Warm to the touch. No rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Somnolent closing her eyes when not stimulated,
arousing with gentle tactile stimulation, oriented to ___
(one day off the date), reported initially at "an OR somewhere"
corrected to BI and when asked after exam where she was, she
answered correctly. Able to relate history some history with 
some
inaccuracies.  Mildly inattentive, could not perform ___
backwards - got from ___ to ___ and then started 
going
in random order. Could perform ___ backwards. Language is fluent
with intact repetition and comprehension. Normal prosody. There
was some mild dysarthria vs very mild paraphasic errors. Pt was
able to name both high and low frequency objects.  Able to read
without difficulty. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands - could do two step commands on second try. On the 
first
attempt, she initially extinguished to DSS - both sensory and
visual but then corrected on repeated stimulation. 

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI with bilateral
end gaze nystagmus left more than right which does not fatigue -
no double vision. Hypometric saccades. Saccadic breakdown of
smooth pursuit. VFF to confrontation - extinguished once to DSS,
corrected with repeated testing. Fundoscopic exam revealed no
papilledema on the right, left difficult to visualize though
lateral edge was visualized as sharp.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. On testing of drift, her
right fingers cup and she pronates the right hand. Mildly slowed
finger tap on the right compared to the left.

======================================

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
Neurological exam reveals her to be alert, oriented to time,
place and person.  Speech and language are normal.  She may have
mild word finding difficulty for low frequency words such as
cuticle but she seem to make a paraphasic error and then
eventually got the word correctly.  She has a pronator drift on
the right side, otherwise full. Sensory exam is normal including 
cortical
sensation. She was able to walk with a steady gait.
