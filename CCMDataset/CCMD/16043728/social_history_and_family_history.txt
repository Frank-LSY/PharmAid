Pertinent Results:
___ Second Opinion Read of CT Torso on ___: 
1. Thickening of the cecum and terminal/distal ileum. 
Ill-defined region of stranding/soft tissue thickening seen 
between the right psoas muscle and posterior to the cecum which 
appears to heterogeneously enhanced on venous images, of unclear 
etiology. Differential diagnosis includes inflammatory process 
related to the cecal thickening and there are multiple small 
lymph nodes/nodularity. Underlying associated hemorrhage not 
excluded. The size of this region of stranding/soft tissue 
thickening has not significantly changed from the prior CT 20 
hours prior. Appendix not seen separate from this, correlate 
with concern for appendicitis. Complex tender repeat study with 
long oral contrast prep. 
2. 7 mm arterial enhancing focus in the spleen which is less 
conspicuous on venous imaging, could represent a small 
pseudoaneurysm or AVM. 11 mm arterial enhancing focus more 
posterior in the spleen is nonspecific, possibly hemangioma or 
AVM.
