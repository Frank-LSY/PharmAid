Congenital muscular dystrophy: patient experiences limitations
because of his generalized muscle weakness (i.e. cannot run,
cannot get up from the floor if he falls; has difficulty walking
up the stairs, walking longer distance and getting up from a
chair but not out of bed) but lives by himself and functions
independently without requiring assistance
