-- His VS were taken while observing the screen on the telemetry 
box. Though his electrical rate is recorded as ___, he is noted 
to have bigeminy, and a pulse is only palpable during the 
initial QRS complex of the couplet ("morphology 1" - appears to 
be native P->QRS). Heart sounds can only be auscultated during 
the initial QRS complex (not the second complex, "morphology 2," 
which appears to be a non-conducted PVC). There appears to be no 
cardiac activity in response to the second beat (morphology 2), 
making his actual pulse ___ despite recorded electrical activity 
in the ___. 
-- I asked the patient to exercise through a series of about 30 
"prisoner squats," which increased his HR to 100s. he did not 
develop lightheadedness, syncope, or other symptoms. on 
telemetry, his HR increased, and there were more native QRS 
complexes and fewer non-conducted PVCs
-- Heart sounds regular, with distant S1/S2. NMRG.
