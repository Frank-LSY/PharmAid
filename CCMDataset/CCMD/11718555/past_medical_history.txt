PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  
- ___: Metastatic rectal cancer diagnosis during workup for
bright  
 red blood per rectum. Given the distribution of the hepatic  
 metastases, surgical resection was not possible at that time.  
 - Received 12 cycles of bevacizumab/FOLFOX with palliative  
 intent and demonstrated a good response  
 - ___: Placed on maintenance Xeloda  
 - Interval restaging studies found to have progressive disease
with recurrence of clustered intrahepatic biopsy-proven
metastases.  
 - Received four cycles of bevacizumab/FOLFIRI, also with good  
 response, with consideration of subsequent metastasectomy.  
 However, given the distribution of the intrahepatic metastases, 


 it was concluded that an overly extensive hepatic 
metastasectomy

 would leave a potential inadequate hepatic remnant.  
 - Underwent Y-90 chemoembolization on ___ at ___,
complicated by recurrent vomiting  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Asthma
Metstatic Rectal CA
