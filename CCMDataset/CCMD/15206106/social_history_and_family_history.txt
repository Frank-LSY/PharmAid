Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with developmental delay, chronic spasticity, 
admitted with profound iron-deficiency anemia (Hgb 3.4 on 
presentation)
    
# Iron deficiency anemia: 
Acute on likely chronic anemia related to iron deficiency. We 
only have labs available from ___, at which time she had a very 
mild microcytic anemia. There were no systemic symptoms or signs 
of severe anemia and she was without of tachycardia/hypotension 
and overall benign appearance suggest a chronic process. There 
was no melena or BRBPR, no hemolysis evident on labs or evidence 
of ecchymoses or hematoma. After receiving 2u PRBCs, her Hgb 
improved to 6.5 and continued to rise despite no further blood 
transfusions being given (6.5 -> 7.0 -> 7.4). GI was consulted 
and original plan was for EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for 
unexplained iron deficiency. However, ___ was unable to 
tolerate a prep including with flavoring. The only option would 
be for NGT and possible restraints. In several extensive 
discussions with family they were opposed to restraints and NGT 
for preparation so decision ultimately came down to watchful 
waiting with serial CBCs. If H/H begins downtrending despite 
supplemental Fe then she can return for a direct admission for 
planned EGD and ___. (See extensive GI note in OMR for details 
regarding discussion with family about the plan). Ant-TTG and 
total IgA were normal. She was started on an oral iron 
supplement, oral PPI empirically for potential gastritis and 
miralax to prevent constipation while on iron. 
 
Transitional Issues:
- If H/H continues to drop in observation then she can be 
directly admitted for inpatient EGD and colonoscopy prep which 
will require NG tube be placed and
likely restraints.
