Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the breast surgery service following 
her left total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. She 
tolerated the procedure well and was recovered in the PACU. It 
was noted by anesthesia that she had some blood in her mouth on 
extubation however no laceration could be seen. It was later 
discovered that she had a history of an oral ulcer that was the 
source of the bleeding. Her PACU stay was otherwise uneventful 
and she was then admitted to the floor for overnight 
observation. Her pain was well controlled on minimal oral 
medications and she had no other significant complaints. On the 
morning of POD1 she felt well and was fit for discharge. She was 
able to void without issue, tolerate PO, ambulate independently, 
and her pain was controlled with oral medications. She was 
discharged with her surgical drain in place after receiving 
drain teaching with the assistance of a ___ interpreter. 
She is scheduled to follow up in clinic in approximately one 
month.
