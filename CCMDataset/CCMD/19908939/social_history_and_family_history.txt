Brief Hospital Course:
Legal: ___
Psychiatric:
While in the ED, patient appeared irritable, guarded, paranoid, 
and was noted to respond to internal stimuli. He became agitated 
but was verbally redirectible and agreeable to taking a total of 
Haldol 5mg and Ativan 1.5mg over the course of 24 hours. He 
slept quietly for most of the night and following day. Tox 
screens were notably negative. Upon arrival to Deac 4, patient 
was calmer and more organized. When asked, he continued to state 
his belief that his penis might be shrinking, though he was less 
distressed by this concern. He remained vague and sometimes 
inconsistent in his responses, but did state repeatedly that 
being hospitalized was a "misunderstanding" because he had just 
wanted an "evaluation" for his penis and headache.
