Brief Hospital Course:
This is a complicated case of a ___ year old ___ woman, 
currently a student at
___, no known formal psychiatric history, 
who presented to ___ ED on a ___ after expressing 
suicidal ideation to her student counselor. 
. 
Interview with patient on admission was extremely limited, given 
her reluctance to engage in the interview. However, patient 
admitted that things have not been going well and admitted to 
feeling lonely but denied SI, thoughts of self harm, AVH.
Mental status examination notable for very withdrawn young 
woman, with adequate hygiene and grooming, speech that is very 
low in volume, extremely poor eye contact, and affect that was 
notably blunted.
.
Diagnostically, the differential was very broad given my limited 
history and collateral includes mood disorder such as major 
depressive disorder or even bipolar (as I cannot rule out a 
prior manic history), prodromal presentation/underlying primary 
psychotic disorder, mood/psychotic disorder secondary to 
substance use (although she denied and tox screen was negative 
in the ED) or underlying medical condition (although less likely 
given young age and unremarkable medical work up thus far). 
. 
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted to ___ on a 
___, upon admission she initially refused to sign a 
conditional voluntary agreement but later signed in on ___ 
with a 3 day notice. After discussion of the risks and benefits, 
she rescinded the 3 day notice on ___, but at that time we had 
been able to obtain collateral from her mother, who was in 
agreement with discharge back home to ___. 
Of note, she maintained her safety throughout her 
hospitalization on 15 minute checks and did not require physical 
or chemical restraints. 
. 
#. Unspecified mood disorder: 
- Throughout the hospitalization, patient was guarded and only 
partially cooperative with the treatment team. She was unwilling 
to answer many questions regarding her history and symptoms. She 
endorses multiple depressive symptoms including insmonia, 
anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. She 
reported profound ambivalence about her life and social 
situation regarding school and her visa though denied active 
suicidal ideation or plan to the primary team. Her exam was 
notable for extremely soft volume of speech, low rate of speech, 
and lack of spontaneous speech. She was also noted to have an 
odd and childlike affect and to often be laughing/smiling 
inappropriately. Patient consistently denied auditory/visual 
hallucinations, paranoia, suicidal ideation or thoughts of self 
harm. She also denied history of manic symptoms and substance 
use. Her presentation was concerning for underlying mood 
disorder vs. psychotic disorder vs. decompensated character 
pathology; unfortunately, my differential diagnosis remains 
broad at time of discharge. 
.
During the hospitalization, patient was started on Risperdal 0.5 
mg at night due to concern for underlying psychotic process and 
patient's complaint of insomnia. Patient reported good response 
to this medication without side effects. She was also started on 
Zoloft which was uptitrated to 50 mg daily, which she tolerated 
without complaints of side effects. She was offered Ativan 0.5 
mg BID PRN which she used rarely. 
.
With significant support, Ms. ___ agreed to allow us to contact 
her mother in ___ to aid with disposition and safety planning. 
During this conversation, patient's affect was noted to improve 
significantly and she became more engaged, agreeing to return 
home with her mother, who was in agreement and supportive of 
this discharge plan. Given her lack of social supports here and 
this reasonable discharge plan, as well as Ms. ___ expressed 
and consistent desire to leave the hospital, she was discharged 
home with an appointment with ___ with 
the ultimate plan for her to return home with her mother. 
.
#. Medical: no acute issues during this hospitalization
