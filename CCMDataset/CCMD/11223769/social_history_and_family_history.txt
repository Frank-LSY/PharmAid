Brief Hospital Course:
#. Rhabdomyolysis:  Most likely multifactorial, including trauma 
(waterskiing), exertion (increased exercise recently), possibly 
predisposing chronic hypokalemia and recent hypotension in 
setting of diuretic use. CK was very elevated at 93K on 
admission with a low potassium but otherwise normal chem panel 
and UA notable only for RBCs.  His diuretic was held and he was 
given aggressive IVF with bicarbonate.  CK, LDH, ALT, AST levels 
trended down (CK at discharge was 22K), and he transitioned to 
aggressive PO fluids. Throughout admission, renal function was 
stable(Cr 0.9-1.0), there was no evidence of compartment 
syndrome, and potassium remained low (3.1-3.8). EKG was 
unchanged from prior. 
  Regarding work-up for possible etiologies of rhabdomyolysis, 
his serum tox and urine tox screens were negative; CMV panel was 
consistent with cleared prior infection; CRP was normal at 2.8 
and ___ was negative; TSH was normal at 3.9, lactate was 
elevated at 2.0 but nonspecific. Neuro was consulted for recs on 
additional workup of rhabdo etiologies and recommended 
Acylcarnitine, Carnitine, Pyruvate labs and neuromuscular 
follow-up for possible EMG or muscle biopsy. He was discharged 
home with potassium supplement packets and labs follow-up for 
___. Carnitine, Pyruvate, EBV, Lyme panels were pending at the 
time of discharge. 
.  
# Hypokalemia: his hypokalemia was unexpected given his 
rhabdomyolysis. K was repleted as needed. Further work-up of 
hypokalemia/additional causes of renal potassium wasting such as 
channelopathy, Bartter or Gitelman's syndromes, or 
hyperaldosteronism were considered but deferred for outpatient 
care.
.
# Anxiety: patient became increasingly anxious about his health 
over the course of the hospitalization, in the setting of 
multiple recent stressors at work and in medical settings. At 
his request, he was started on Bupropion 150mg daily and was 
discharged with lorazepam 0.5mg Q4-6h PRN anxiety.
.
#. Meinere's: home dose of HCTZ/Triamterene was held throughout 
the admission as above and patient was discharged without 
restarting it, with instructions to follow up with his PCP. 
 
Medications on Admission:
HCTZ/Triamterene 25 mg /37.5 mg daily (stopped by PCP one week 
prior to admission)
