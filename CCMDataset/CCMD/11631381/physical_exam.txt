ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM
=========================
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: Normal work of breathing
Cardiac: RRR, warm, well-perfused
Abdomen: soft, non-distended
Extremities: No ___ edema.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
 
Neurologic:
Mental Status: 
Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history without difficulty.
Attentive, able to name ___ backward without difficulty. 
Language
is fluent with intact repetition and comprehension. Normal
prosody. There were no paraphasic errors. Pt was able to name
both high and low frequency objects.  Able to read without
difficulty. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to follow both
midline and appendicular commands. Pt was able to register 3
objects and recall ___ at 5 minutes. There was no evidence of
apraxia or neglect.

Cranial Nerves:
No visual field cuts.  PERRL.  There is a non extinguishing
nystagmus on primary gaze with the fast phase to the left and
slow phase to the right.  With end gaze to the right there is no
nystagmus, but with end gaze to the left there is a non
extinguishing nystagmus with fast phase to left and slow phase 
to
right.  Cover, uncover is without skew.  HITS is without
corrective saccade.  Patient would not tolerate ___
maneuver. Facial sensation and musculature is symmetric.  
Hearing
intact.  Uvula midline with symmetric rise of palate.  SCM ___. 
Tongue protrudes to midline with forceful lateral excursions. 

Motor: 
Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. No asterixis
noted.
  Delt Bic Tri WrE  FE  IP Quad Ham  TA ___  ___ 
L  5    ___   ___    5    5    5     5   
R  5    ___   ___    5    5     5    5   

Sensory: 
No deficits to light touch, pinprick, cold sensation, vibratory
sense, proprioception throughout. No extinction to DSS. Romberg
absent. 

DTRs:
  Bi Tri ___ Pat Ach
L  2  2    2    2   1
R  2  2    2    2   1
Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

Coordination: 
There are no appendicular cerebellar signs: FNF and HTS without
dysmetria, no rebound with outstretched arms, taping of the 
thumb
joint line is accurate. However, when patient sits up and closes
eyes he veers to the right and will fall to the right if allowed
to.  I tested this three times with the same result.

Gait: 
Patient will not tolerate safely standing up, therefore 
deferred.
