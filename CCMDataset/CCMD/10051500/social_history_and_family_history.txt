IMAGING
=======
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 2:47 ___
No radiopaque foreign body seen projecting over the course of 
the esophagus. 
 
___ EGD
Impression: Erythema, friability and congestion with exudates in 
the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the 
esophagus compatible with esophagitis (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
 
Recommendations: - Will contact you with biopsy results 
- Start PO Omeprazole 40 mg Q12H for now 
- Diet as tolerated 
 
DISCHARGE LABS
==============
___ 06:15AM BLOOD Glucose-90 UreaN-9 Creat-0.8 Na-141 K-3.9 
Cl-105 HCO3-23 AnGap-17
___ 06:15AM BLOOD Calcium-8.6 Phos-3.1 Mg-1.___ female with history of HTN, HLD, IFGT and obesity who 
presented with 2 days of odynophagia to solids and liquids 
without evidence of airway compromise, autoimmune symptoms, 
anemia or abscess. She underwent upper endoscopy which was 
notable for esophagitis without evidence of bleeding. Mucosal 
biopsies pending at time of discharge. Patient responded to IV 
PPI BID and continued to improve on oral PPI BID. She was 
tolerating regular diet and was discharged on omeprazole 40mg 
BID with PCP follow up. 
 
# Odynophagia
Presented with 2 days of throat pain, subjective throat 
swelling, and inability to swallow. Initially there was concern 
for cardiac etiology given sub-sternal nature of the pain, but 
EKG unremarkable for ischemia and troponin was negative x 2. No 
foreign body identified on CXR, no pneumomediastinum or 
subcutaneous emphysema. Treated with diltiazem for concern for 
diffuse esophageal spasm but patient did not respond to this 
therapy. Patient underwent EGD ___ that showed erythema and 
exudates in mid and distal esophagus which likely represents 
esophagitis from reflux. She was started on IV PPI BID with good 
response to anti-reflux therapy. She was tolerating regular diet 
and was discharged on omeprazole 40mg BID with PCP follow up. 
___ biopsies pending at time of discharge.  
 
CHRONIC ISSUES
 
# HTN: home medications initially held given normotension and 
poor oral intake. BP rose after endoscopy and with resumption of 
oral nutrition. Restarted home lisinopril 10mg QD, 
triamterene-HCTZ (37.5/25) QD. 
 
# HLD: home statin initially held given interaction between 
pravastatin and diltiazem for possible esophageal spasm. 
Diltiazem was discontinued and restarted home simvastatin 20mg 
QD
 
# Allergic rhinitis: stable. Continued home fluticasone and held 
home cetirizine-pseudoephedrine.
 
 
# Code: Full, confirmed
# Communication: ___ (son) ___
