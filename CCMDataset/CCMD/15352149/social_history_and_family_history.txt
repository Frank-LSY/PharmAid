the foot.  There is resolving ecchymosis along the medial and
lateral aspect of the foot.  The patient is not able to range

Imaging:  X-rays of the left ankle as well as stress views were
obtained today in clinic and reviewed with the patient.  X-rays
demonstrate a distal fibular fracture with stress views.  There
is noticeable widening of the ankle mortise.

Assessment:  Left ankle fracture with widening of ankle mortise.

Plan:  The patient was seen and evaluated by myself and Dr.
___ at today's visit.  She does have an unstable ankle
fracture that requires operative intervention.  We discussed 
with
the patient that we would perform open reduction internal
fixation of left ankle fracture.  

Risks and benefits of the proposed surgery were discussed in
detail with the patient. We discussed both non-operative as well
as operative treatments.  Risk of the surgery include, but are
not limited to, infection, bleeding and injury to arteries and
veins, wound complications, injury to nerves and tendons,
neuroma, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, reflex
sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome, failure
to return to previous athletic level, need for additional
procedures and even the remote risk of catastrophic 
complications
such as loss of limb, heart attack, stroke and/or loss of life.
Specific to bony surgeries such as fusions and fractures there 
is
additional risk of ___ or ___, recurrence of
deformity and prominent hardware which may require removal in 
the
future. For soft tissue procedures there is also a risk of
re-injury or re-rupture of repaired ligaments and tendons.  

In the interim, we have placed the patient in an AO splint.  She
was provided with a script for home services to help her with
ADLs, as she lives alone.  Additionally, I have provided her 
with
a small pain medication refill, given the severity of her pain. 
We have reached out to our administrative staff to help
facilitate the booking of her surgery.  We will likely contact
the patient in one to two days with an operative date and time.

Exam: Tenderness to palpation in the left lateral ankle. Edema. 
Reduced range of motion.
Impression: Left ankle fracture with widening of the ankle
mortise.
Plan: ORIF left ankle fracture
