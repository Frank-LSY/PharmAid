NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
MS - Awake, alert, oriented to hospital, month, year but not 
date. Able to relate history without difficulty. Somewhat 
verbose/chatty and garrulous, at times a bit tangential. 
Attention to examiner easily attained but may again become a bit 
tangential; able to recall days of week backwards, initially 
skips ___ but then with single prompt able to self-correct. 
Naming intact to low frequency objects (pen, thumb, fingernail). 
Recalls a fairly coherent history, though again at times 
tangential. During examination patient gets tearful when his 
deficits are revealed via the exam (when has difficulty with 
strength testing, for example) and then expresses low mood and 
some hopelessness when discussing his healthcare proxy and code 
status.  Structure of speech demonstrates fluency with full 
sentences, and normal prosody. No paraphasic errors. Intact 
repetition and comprehension. No evidence of apraxia or neglect.

CN - Pupil on the left larger at baseline (4.5 vs 3mm) but 
constricts well to light bilaterally without obvious evidence of 
APD. VF full to number counting. [III, IV, VI] EOMI, no 
nystagmus. [V] V1-V3 without deficits to light touch 
bilaterally. [VII] Left lower facial droop at rest and with 
slower and incomplete activation of left lower face. [VIII] 
Hearing intact to finger rub on right, not on left (patient 
reports at times as cerumen). [IX, X] Palate elevation 
symmetric. No dysarthria. [XI] SCM/Trapezius strength ___ on 
right, trapezius 4- on left. [XII] Tongue midline.

MOTOR - Spasticity throughout, more notably in right lower 
extremity and with mild ankle contractures bilaterally. Right 
IP, quad, hamstring strength limited somewhat by patient 
beginning to have muscle spasms as testing.
