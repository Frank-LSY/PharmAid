PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  
 ___- noted right breast Mass  
 ___ breast imaging showed a 2.1 x 2.4 x 1.6 cm 
mass in the right axillary tail as well as a 1.4 x 0.7 cm right 
axillary node  
 ___ breast mass biopsy showed invasive ductal 
carcinoma, grade 2, measuring at least 1.2 cm, with focal DCIS 
of intermediate high nuclear grade, solid type. Perineural 
invasion was present. There was no lymphovascular invasion. This 
was felt to represent a primary breast carcinoma rather than a 
lymph node metastasis. The invasive carcinoma was diffusely 
strongly positive for estrogen receptor (greater than 95%), 
progesterone receptor positive (40%, weak variable staining), 
and HER-2/neu +1 (negative); the right breast axillary node 
showed invasive carcinoma with both ductal and lobular features, 
grade 2, without an in situ component. Lymphatic/vascular 
invasion was present. The specimen showed a possible lymph node 
capsule but no lymph node tissue. This suggested a lymph node 
that was completely replaced by tumor however the radiologist 
recommended correlation to exclude the possibility that this 
represents a second primary tumor and confirmed that this is a 
lymph node. This showed similar immunohistochemical staining.  
 ___- bone scan without evidence of metastatic disease  
 ___- CT C/A/P showed no evidence of disease in chest; 
findings suspicious for bilateral hydrosalpinx were noted on 
pelvic CT and dedicated pelvic ultrasound was recommended; 
pelvic u/s negative- radiologist suspects they were seeing 
unopacified loops of small bowel  
 ___- breast MRI showed known right UOQ cancer abutting 
chest wall, not involving skin; UIQ with 1.5 cm non mass 
enhancement; prominent right axillary nodes; UIQ of left breast 
with 1 cm area of non mass enhancement; add'l eval recommended 
for ipsilateral (right) UIQ lesion and contralateral (left) UIQ 
lesion; neither seen on u/s; biopsies ultimately performed 
___ of both and both were benign  
 ___ - C1 D1 Doxorubicin/Cychlophosphamide  
 ___ - C2 D1 Doxorubicin/Cychlophosphamide  
 
 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
 - s/p colposcopy cervix w/ loop conization  
 - s/p appendectomy
