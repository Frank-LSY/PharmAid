IMAGING:
========================
ECG (___): Sinus rhythm. Minor ST segment depression in the 
inferior leads with T wave inversion in the inferior and 
anterolateral precordial leads are suggestive of ischemia. 
Clinical correlation is suggested. Non-diagnostic lateral Q 
wave. Non-specific ST segment changes in the lateral limb leads. 
Q waves in  leads V1-V2, possibly suggest anteroseptal 
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Left atrial 
abnormality. Possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to 
the previous tracing of ___ the inferior and lateral ST-T 
wave changes are all new, suggesting ischemia and clinical 
correlation is suggested.

Exercise stress test (___):
INTERPRETATION: This ___ yo woman with h/o HTN was referred to 
the lab from the inpatient floor following negative serial 
cardiac enzymes for evaluation of syncope and abnormal EKG. The 
patient exercised for 2.25 minutes of a Modified ___ protocol 
and was stopped for a hypertensive blood pressure response. The 
estimated peak MET capacity was 2.1, which represents a poor 
exercise tolerance for her age. There were no reports of chest, 
back, neck, or arm discomforts, or presyncopal type symptoms. 
There were no significant ST changes noted during exercise or 
recovery. Rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated VPBs, two 
ventricular couplets, and rare isolated APBs. There was an 
appropriate heart rate response during exercise and recovery. 
Resting systolic and diastolic hypertension with an exaggerated 
systolic blood pressure response to exercise. Blood pressure 
decreased initially during recovery before rebounding in late 
recovery (216/86 at 8 min recovery). 
  
IMPRESSION: Exaggerated systolic blood pressure response to a 
limited achieved workload in the absence of anginal or 
presyncopal type symptoms and no ischemic EKG changes. Echo 
report sent separately. 
===
Transthoracic echocardiogram (___):
The patient exercised for 2 minutes and 15 seconds according to 
a Modified ___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak 
heart rate of 131 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 252/100 mmHg. 
The test was stopped because of a hypertensive response. This 
level of exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age 
and gender. In response to stress, the ECG showed no ST-T wave 
changes (see exercise report for details). There is resting 
hypertension with an abnormal/hypertensive response to exercise.
