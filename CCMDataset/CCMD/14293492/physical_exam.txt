Able to read without difficulty.  Speech was not dysarthric. 
Able to follow both midline and appendicular commands.  

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 4 to 2mm bilaterally.  
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus. With ___ testing,
with right ear down had subtle torsional nystagmus (clockwise).
She became nauseated with testing both directions. Head impulse
test was negative.  
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch in all distributions 
VII: No facial droop with symmetric upper and lower facial
musculature bilaterally  
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: full strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with full ROM right and left 
 
-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally. No tremor noted.

vibratory sense, proprioception throughout.

-Coordination: No dysmetria on FNF bilaterally. No overshoot on
mirroring or quick descent of arms. Finger tapping on thumb
crease was accurate bilaterally but the patient subjectively 
felt
it was clumsy and more effortful with the right hand.  

-Gait: Good initiation. Narrow-based, normal stride.  Able to
