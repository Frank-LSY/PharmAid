Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a healthy ___ y/o man who presented to the hospital 
with new onset dyspnea on exertion and significant reduction in 
exercise tolerance, who was found to have extensive pulmonary 
embolism, and RLE DVT.
.
#Acute PE:
At baseline he is an avid runner but ___ days prior to admission 
he noted significant reduction in his exercise tolerance. He 
presented to his PCP who noted elevated d-dimer and he was 
ultimately referred to our ED where CTA chest showed "Acute 
saddle pulmonary embolus with extensive bilateral lobar through 
sub-segmental involvement involving all lobes of the lungs." 
Troponin and BNP were not elevated and TTE showed RV dilation 
without other evidence of RV strain or pulmonary hypertension. 
He was continued on heparin drip for around 48 hours and 
transitioned to apixaban 10 BID prior to discharge. 
.
Of note, he did report two plane flights around 2 weeks prior to 
admission (one of which was transatlantic), which are a 
provoking factor. However, he has a brother who had a VTE, which 
raises concern for inheritable hypercoagulable state. MASCOT 
team recommended follow up with hematology to determine the need 
for hypercoagulability workup. Also of note, he was not up to 
date on malignancy screening and should have a colonoscopy once 
discharged and consider a PSA. At least 6 months of 
anticoagulation is recommended. 
.
#CONTACT: ___ (wife) ___
.
Transitional Issues: 
[] Continue Apixaban: 
   - 10mg BID ___ 
   - 5mg BID starting ___ 
   - Duration at least 6 months
   - Please refer to ___ Hematology for decision regarding 
hypercoagulability workup. 
[] Please complete age-appropriate cancer screening including: 
colonoscopy and consider PSA testing
