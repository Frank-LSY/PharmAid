Physical Exam:
Admission Physical Exam:
Neurologic examination: 
Mental status:  
He is awake, alert, and cooperative with the exam.  He is
oriented to name, place and date.  He is attentive, able to say
months of the year backwards.  Fund of knowledge is intact.  He
is able to provide the last three presidents and is able to
detail important historical details.  Language is fluent, but
speech is flat and lacks intonation.  Left, right 
differentiation
and calculations are intact.  No evidence of ideational,
ideomotor, or limb kinetic apraxia.  No frontal reflease signs,
including glabellar, palmomental, and grasp reflexes.  
Cranial nerves:  
Pupils are equal and reactive.  Extraocular movements are full. 
Patient initially had abnormal eye and eyelid movements that he
could not control and I examined him while occurring.  Patient's
eyelids were fluttering rhythmically at a high frequency and on
primary gaze he was having rapid movements of his eyes in the
horizontal plane.  I could not determine a fast or slow phase of
the eye movement.  I asked him to look medially and laterally 
and
during the saccade and the end gaze he continued to have the
abnormal horizontal eye movement.  He could look upward and
downward and, again, during the pursuit and maintenance of the
upward and downward gaze he continued to have the abnormal
horizontal eye movement.  I left patient and came back later to
examine him and tried to wait til he had abnormal eye/eyelid
movement, but then he disclosed to me he could perform the
abnormal movements on command.  The voluntary abnormal movement
was identical to the "involuntary" abnormal movement described
above.  Facial sensation and movement are intact and symmetric. 
Hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally.  Patient's speech 
is
slow, but not dysarthric.  Palate elevates symmetrically.  SCM
and trapezius are full strength bilaterally.  Tongue is midline.
