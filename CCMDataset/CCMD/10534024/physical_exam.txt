intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.

-Gait: No truncal ataxia on sitting with arms crossed. Good
initiation on standing. With eyes open and closed, she lists to
right, however she is steady when distracted with tasks. Takes
few steps but lists to right and retropulses back to bed.

Radiologic Data:

Non-Contrast CT of Head (OSH ___:
No hemorrhage. ?small R posterior cerebellar hypodensity vs
artifact. (my read)

MRA head/neck (OSH ___:
Severe/critical stenosis of right vertebral artery 
intracranially
with reconstitution just proximal to joining left at basilar
artery (my read)

***************

ASSESSMENT:

___ F w/ past medical history of 2 prior CVAs, on Plavix w/ R
vertebral stenosis on MRA ___, numerous risk factors, p/w
headache x8 days and gait instability x2 days. Examination
reveals subtle right facial weakness, sensory deficits in left
forearm, and truncal ataxia upon standing with listing to right.
In light of her previous infarcts, cardiovascular risk factors,
and known vessel disease, a new ischemic lesion is possible.
Localization to explain all these deficits could be pontine,
likely lacunar infarct, with involvement of crossfibers carrying
input from the cerebellum. That said, there are some 
inconsistent
elements such as the monocular diplopia/triplopia which in
conjunction with background of significant psychosocial 
stressors
injects possibility of functional overlay or an additional
disease process such as atypical/complex migraine. There is no
sign of increased intracranial pressure or infectious etiology
for her headaches and they have improved to conservative
treatment.
