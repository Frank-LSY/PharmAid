___ 06:40AM BLOOD Lipase-___ostochondritis: Patient presented with chest and epigastric 
pain with elevated lipase concerning for pancreatitis. US showed 
mild CBD dilatation, so she had an MRCP to see if gallstones 
were present. MRCP however showed no evidence of pancreatitis 
and no stones. It did show a focally dilated segment IVB 
intrahepatic bile duct with peribiliary 
hyperenhancement/restricted diffusion concerning for focal 
active cholangitis. Her pain had resolved without intervention, 
and repeating lipase and checking amylase showed no elevation. 
This suggests that the original reported elevation was spurious. 
EKG showed no evidence of ischemia. Her known costochondritis 
seems a more likely explanation of the pain.
[ ] Recommend follow-up MRCP in 3 months to ensure resolution.
