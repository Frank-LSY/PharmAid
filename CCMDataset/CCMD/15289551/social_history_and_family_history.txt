___ COLONOSCOPY:
Findings:  
Mucosa: Submucosal hemorrhage, petechiae, friability and pus 
with contact bleeding were noted in the distal rectum. Localized 
petechiae, erythema, friability, congestion and submucosal 
hemorrhage-very patchy with contact bleeding were noted in the 
splenic flexure, proximal descending colon and mid-sigmoid 
colon. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 
splenic flexure and mid-sigmoid colon. 
.
Protruding Lesions A single sessile 3 mm polyp of benign 
appearance was found in the mid-sigmoid colon. A single-piece 
polypectomy was performed using a cold forceps. The polyp was 
completely removed. 
Impression: Submucosal hemorrhage, petechiae, friability and 
pus in the distal rectum Petechiae, erythema, friability, 
congestion and submucosal hemorrhage-very patchy in the splenic 
flexure, proximal descending colon and mid-sigmoid colon 
(biopsy)
Polyp in the mid-sigmoid colon (polypectomy)
