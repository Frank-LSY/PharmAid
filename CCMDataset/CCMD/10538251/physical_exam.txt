V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift 
bilaterally. No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.  
Strength ___ except RLE with 4+/5 strength at IP, quad, ham, TA 
and gastroc (baseline per patient from prior leg injury).  
 
-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, temperature 
throughout. No extinction to DSS.

-DTRs:
  Bi Tri ___ Pat Ach
L  2  2    2       1     1
R  2  2    2      -     1
Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted. 
No dysmetria on FNF.

-Gait: Good initiation. Narrow-based, slightly shuffling gait, 
no veering noted. 

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 

Physical Exam:

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: AAOX3 (person, place, and full date). Fluency of 
language is preserved with intact naming and repetition. Reading 
is preserved and speech is dysarthric. Able to follow multi-step 
commands, both axial and appendicular. No neglect or apraxia.  

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm. EOMI with double vision on 
sustained leftward gaze (not reproducible on later exam)

right side of face (V1 distribution).
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing grossly decreased
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. Mild RT pronation w/o 
drift. Bilateral action tremor worse on LT than RT. Strength ___ 
in bilateral upper extremities with the exception of bilateral 
interosei  ___. RT IP was pain limited, otherwise full. LT IP 
was ___.   
 
-Sensory: Decreased sensation to PP over BLE in a stocking 
pattern consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Also observed 
hyperesthesia over this area. 

-DTRs:
  Bi Tri ___ Pat Ach
L  2  2    2    -   -
R  2  2    2    -   -
