NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented.  Able to relate history without
difficulty.  Language is fluent with normal prosody.  There were
no paraphasic errors.  Pt. was able to name both high and low
frequency objects. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands.  Attentive, able to name ___ backward without
difficulty. There was no evidence of neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 3.5 to 3mm bilaterally.  VFF to confrontation with
finger counting. Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema.
III, IV, VI: EOM were restricted in all directions, with
conjugate gaze, no diplopia, and no nystagmus. Saccades were
hypometric and mildly slow in all directions. Bilateral ptosis 
is
present.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch in all distributions 
VII: Mild, symmetric facial weakness present bilaterally 
VIII: Hearing intact to voice bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically. There is a nasal quality 
to
his voice.
XI: full strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with full ROM right and left 
 
-Motor: Right>left pronation but no drift bilaterally. No tremor
noted.

-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, cold sensation,
vibratory sense throughout. No extinction to DSS. Graphesthesia
intact.

-Coordination: No dysmetria out of proportion to weakness on FNF
bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements with normal and
symmetric cadence and speed. No asymmetry with mirroring. No
rebound. Finger tapping is symmetric bilaterally.

-Gait: non-ambulatory at baseline
