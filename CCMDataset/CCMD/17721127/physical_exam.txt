*In the RLE, the listed above is what she was did on
confrontational testing. However, she was able to keep her right
leg rigid against gravity when getting out of bed and able to
bear weight momentarily when walking. The strength must 
therefore
be more than what she gave on confrontational exam. 
**She was able to stand/walk on this L leg while keeping her
right leg stiff and mostly non weight bearing when walking. The
strength must therefore be more than she gave on confrontational
testing.
