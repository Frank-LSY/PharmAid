ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
-Vitals: T:100.8  BP:139/88  HR:115  RR:20  SaO2:99%
-General: Awake, cooperative. (See HPI for initial impression)
-HEENT: NC/AT. No scleral icterus noted. MMM. No lesions noted 
in
oropharynx.
-Neck: Supple. No nuchal rigidity.
-Cardiac: RRR. Well perfused. 
-Pulmonary: Breathing comfortably on room air.
-Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND. 
-Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema bilaterally. 2+
radial pulses.
-Skin: No rashes or other lesions noted.

NEUROLOGIC EXAM:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 4. Initially had poor memory 
of
events surrounding collapse during race, later able to recall he
was nearing the end of the race and was "pushing hard" and 
"going
all out". Attentive, able to name ___ backward slowly but
accurately. Language is fluent with intact repetition and
comprehension, initially slightly delayed responses and hesitant
speech, ~1hr later more fluid. Normal prosody. There are no
paraphasic errors. Able to name both high and low frequency
objects. Speech is not dysarthric. Able to follow both midline
and appendicular commands. There is no evidence of neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: Pupils R=3.5mm, L=2.5mm, both briskly reactive. (Anisocoria
decreased in degree from that initially reported by ED staff).
VFF to confrontation and no extinction. 
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus. 
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing grossly intact to speech.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline and equal strength bilaterally.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally. Coarse trembling of limbs (as in chills),
exacerbated (larger amplitude and more irregular) with
confrontational testing.

-Coordination: FNF accurate in proportion to tremor. Repetitive
finger tapping symmetric and with good speed.
