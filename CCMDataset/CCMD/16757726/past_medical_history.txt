                       HEMATOPATHOLOGY REPORT - Final
    
    
   PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
    
   BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:
    
   PLASMA CELL MYELOMA, SEE NOTE.
    
   NOTE:  Bone marrow aspirate contains many small sized plasma 
cells and
   plasmacytoid lymphocytes, collectively amounting to 39% of 
marrow
   aspirate differential. By CD138 immunostain, plasma cells 
occupy 90% of
   marrow core cellularity and appear kappa restricted. By 
concurrent flow
   cytometric assessment of marrow aspirate, CD38 gated plasma 
cells
   comprise 12% of total analyzed events and are cytoplasmic
   immunoglobulin light chain kappa light chain restricted. They 
are CD45
   positive, CD56 positive, CD20 positive, CD117 positive 
(subset), and
   CD19 negative.

   Correlation with cytogenetic (___-___), clinical, 
radiographic, and
   other laboratory findings is recommended for exact nosologic
   subclassification.
    
    
   MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION.
    
   PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR: Not received.
    
   ASPIRATE SMEAR:
   The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists 
of
   multiple cellular spicules. The M:E ratio estimate is 1:1.  
Erythroid
   precursors are decreased in ___ and have normoblastic 
maturation.
   Myeloid precursors are decreased in ___ and show normal 
maturation.
   Megakaryocytes  are normal in ___ abnormal forms are seen 
including
   occasional hypolobated cells and micromegakaryocytes. A 300 
cell
   differential shows 1% blasts, 2% promyelocytes, 12% 
myelocytes, 8%
   metamyelocytes, 8% bands/neutrophils, 0% eosinophils, 30% 
erythroids,
   38% lymphocytes (including many that appear 'plasmacytoid), 
1% plasma
   cells.
    
   CLOT SECTION and BIOPSY SLIDES:
   The core biopsy material is adequate for evaluation. It 
consists of a
   1.5 cm long core biopsy of trabecular marrow, cortical bone, 
cartilage
   and periosteum with a cellularity of 80%. There is an 
interstitial
   infiltrate of mononuclear cells, consistent with plasmacytoid
   lymphocytes and plasma cells occupying 90% of overall 
cellularity, by
   CD138 immunostaining. They are immunoreactive for CD20 and 
are
   kappa-restricted by kappa and lambda immunostains. They are 
negative
   for BCL1, CD23, CD10, BCL6. Ki-67 reveals a low proliferation 
index
   (<1%). CD43, CD5 and CD3 stains highlight admixed T cells.
   In the limited remaining cellularity, erythroid precursors 
are
   decreased in ___ and have overall normoblastic maturation. 
Myeloid
   precursors are decreased in ___ and have normal 
maturation.
   Megakaryocytes are decreased in ___.
   Clot displays findings similar to those of the biopsy.
    
   SPECIAL STAINS:
   Iron stain performed on the aspirate material is adequate for
   evaluation.  Storage iron is present.  Sideroblasts are seen 
and
   occasional ring sideroblasts are present (latter comprise 5% 
of
   nucleated erythroid precursors).
   ___ red staining  performed on the core biopsy is negative 
for
   amyloid.
    
   ADDITIONAL STUDIES:
   Flow cytometry:  Not performed.
   Cytogenetics:  See separate report ___.
   Molecular Studies:  Not performed.
