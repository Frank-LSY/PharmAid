PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  
Ms. ___ has had mammograms at ___ since ___. On
___, screening mammogram revealed architectural distortion
in the left breast along with faint grouped microcalcifications
bilaterally.  Patient thereafter reports being very busy and
pushing off further imaging.  On ___, Ms. ___ 
enrolled
in a screening study offered by ___ Breast Radiology.  
Same-day
contrast-enhanced diagnostic mammogram revealed a left breast
mass associated with architectural distortion within the central
to slightly upper inner portion at anterior depth measuring 1.2 
x
1 x 1.2 cm.  Right breast was unremarkable for a dominant mass,
architectural distortion or microcalcifications but on
re-combined images there was a 0.7 x 0.6 focus of enhancement
within the superior right breast at mid depth, seen only in MLO
projection.  Same-day bilateral screening breast MRI again 
showed
an irregular spiculated left breast mass measuring 1 x 1 x 1.2
cm.  No left axillary or internal mammary lymphadenopathy
present.  However, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy within the
right hilum measuring 3.3 x 2.4 cm in left hilum measuring 2.6 x
2.2 cm was noted.  In addition, right breast was notable for an
enhancing mass in upper outer breast at mid depth measuring 0.6 
x
0.7 x 0.8 cm with features suggesting a fibroadenoma.  Inferior
to this was a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm irregular enhancing mass which
was suspicious and not correlated on contrast-enhanced
mammography.  No right axillary or internal intramammary
lymphadenopathy noted.  Same-day ultrasound-guided core needle
biopsy of left breast mass revealed "Invasive ductal carcinoma,
grade 2, measuring 11 mm in this limited sample. ER positive
(>95%, strong), PR positive (90%, medium), HER2 negative by IHC
(___) & FISH (ratio 1.1); Ductal carcinoma in situ, low to
focally intermediate nuclear grade, solid pattern; Lobular
carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia; Rare
calcifications associated with invasive carcinoma and lobules."
On ___, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of right
breast masses at 11:00, 4cm & 6cm from nipple, revealed benign
findings: a) fibroadenoma and b) breast parenchyma with
pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia.
