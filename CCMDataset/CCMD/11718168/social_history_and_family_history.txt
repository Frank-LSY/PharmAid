Pertinent Results:
___: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED NON TARGETED LIVER BIOPSY 
  
INDICATION:  ___ year old man with transaminitis of unclear 
etiology// Liver biopsy to determine etiology of transaminitis 
  
COMPARISON:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ___, ABDOMINAL 
ULTRASOUND ___. 
  
PROCEDURE: Ultrasound-guided non-targeted liver biopsy. 
  
OPERATORS: Dr. ___, radiology resident and Dr. ___, 
___ 
radiologist. Dr. ___ supervised the trainee during 
the key 
components of the procedure and reviewed and agrees with the 
trainee's 
findings. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Limited preprocedure grayscale and Doppler ultrasound imaging of 
the right 
hepatic lobe was performed and a suitable approach for non 
targeted liver 
biopsy was determined.  No other abnormalities were identified 
on the limited imaging. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the 
procedure were 
explained to the patient.  After a detailed discussion, informed 
written 
consent was obtained.  A pre-procedure timeout using three 
patient identifiers was performed per ___ protocol. 
  
Based on the preprocedure imaging, an appropriate skin entry 
site for the 
biopsy was chosen.  The site was marked.  The skin was then 
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 
superficial soft tissues to the liver capsule were anesthetized 
with 10 mL 1% lidocaine.  Under real-time ultrasound guidance, 
an 18 gauge core biopsy needle was then advanced into the right 
lobe of the liver and a single core biopsy sample was obtained 
and placed in formalin.  The skin was then cleaned and a dry 
sterile dressing was applied. 
There was no immediate complications. 
  
SEDATION:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering 
divided doses of 2 mg Versed and 100 mcg fentanyl throughout the 
total intra-service time of 16 minutes during which patient's 
hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an 
independent trained radiology nurse. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
Uncomplicated non-targeted liver biopsy.
