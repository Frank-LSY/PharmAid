Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old Male with severe Left carotid 
stenosis, 80-99%, asymtpomatic, who was admitted to the ___ 
___ on ___. The patient 
was taken to the operating room and underwent a Left carotid 
endarterectomy. Following the procedure, hemostasis was assured 
and the wound was closed in layers. A dry sterile dressing was 
applied. The patient was awakened and extubated and found to
be neurologically intact. For further details of the procedure, 
please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient tolerated 
the procedure well without complications and was brought to the 
post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. He was placed NPO 
on sips and IV fluids and we waited 6 hours to re-assess 
swallowing. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to 
the vascular surgery floor where he remained through the rest of 
the hospitalization. After 6 hours from surgery, swallowing was 
assessed and adequate and the patient was advanced to a regular 
diet, which he tolerated well without difficulties. Given his 
history of CAD s/p DESx2 to mid LAD, he was immediately placed 
back on his aspirin and plavix. The patient was found to have 
some episodes of bradyacardia ranging from 38-54 in PACU but 
mentioned his baseline is approximately 42 as he is a long 
distance swimmer. He was asymptomatic.
