PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
Vitals: 
afebrile, BP 180/80, RR16, 95-100RA

General: Awake, cooperative
HEENT: no lesions noted in oropharynx.
Neck: Supple. Scarring from thyroidectomy, more pronounced along
right side of neck
Pulmonary: Normal work of breathing.
Cardiac: warm, well-perfused.
Abdomen: Soft, non-distended.
Extremities: Bilateral pedal edema, 1+
Skin: No rashes or lesions noted.
 
Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert and oriented to date and year and city.
Attentive to examiner although with tangential and
circumferential thought. She has a plethora of spontaneous 
speech
output with digressions through conversation (at baseline per 
her
son). Follows simple midline, appendicular, cross-body and
two-step commands. Naming is intact to high and low frequency
objects. No neglect. No apraxia.

-Cranial Nerves: Right pupil 3>2. Left 4>3. EOMI with ___ beats
nystagmus on right lateral gaze. She has hypermetric saccades
when looking at target on right but not on left. No skew
deviation. VFF to finger counting. She has right facial numbness
along scar tissue from thyroidectomy in distribution of V3.
Tongue midline. She has dysarthria with guttural sounds but not
labial sounds. 

-Motor: Normal bulk, decreased tone throughout. Right pronator
drift. No adventitious movements, such as tremor or asterixis
noted.

-Sensory: She has diminished sensation to pinprick and
temperature in stocking-glove distribution. She has diminished
JPS in both her toes bilaterally. Romberg deferred secondary to
gait instability.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

-Coordination: She has dysmetria with right FNF. She has
difficulty with rapid alternating movements with her right hand.
HKS testing is limited by body habitus. She has no ataxia when
asked to touch her right heel to my finger.

-Gait: deferred out of concern for gait instability, fall risk
