Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old Male who presented on ___ for 
a planned minimally invasive and possibly open radical distal 
gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric 
carcinoma after chemotherapy. After placement of the Right upper 
quadrant port, insufflation revealed the right upper quadrant 
port to be penetrating the omentum. It appeared to miss the 
transverse mesocolon as well as the colon itself. During the 
surgery, there were visually obvious peritoneal deposits on all 
peritoneal surfaces in all four quadrants, which demonstrated 
undetected carcinomatosis, poorly -differentiated adenocarcinoma 
involving the peritoneum. For this reason, the procedure was 
then aborted. Post-operatively the patient was taken to the PACU 
until stable and then transferred to the wards until stable to 
go home.
