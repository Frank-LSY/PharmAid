and
comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors.
Pt was able to name high but not low frequency objects.  Able to
read without difficulty. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to
follow both midline and appendicular commands. There was no
evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: Pupils very small, 0.5mm and reactive, symmetrically. VFF
unable to be tested due to mental status, but does BTT
bilaterally 
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus. Normal saccades.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Sensorimotor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No adventitious
movements, such as tremor, noted. Unable to test individual
muscle groups due to inattention and mental status deficits.
Grossly, moves all four extremities symmetrically and
antigravity, against resistance.  
-DTRs:
  Bi Tri ___ Pat Ach
L  2  2    2    2   1
R  2  2    2    2   1
