Brief Hospital Course:
This is the complicated case of a ___ year old ___ speaking 
homeless woman from ___ with very unclear 
psychiatric history, apparently at least one prior psychiatric 
hospitalization in ___, who presented to ___ ED on a ___ after seeing her therapist in significant distress, 
requesting admission to an inpatient psychiatric facility.
. 
History from Ms. ___ was significantly limited, as 
she was notably vague throughout her hospital course but 
significant for feeling quite upset after she overheard a group 
of adolescents commenting on rumors of sexual indiscretion. 
Review of systems is quite limited given her poor historic 
nature, but mental status examination is notable for an 
adequately groomed woman who was noted to be smiling oddly 
during serial interviews, reporting depressed mood but with 
incongruent and blunted affect. Thought process appears to be 
concrete but linear. Of note, she did not appear to be 
responding to internal stimuli during her hospitalization. 
Collateral from her outpatient therapist of one year, Dr. ___ 
___ revealed that she had been on psychotropic 
medications in the past with periods of depression and 
preoccupation that others believe she has been sexually 
inappropriate. 
.
Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is unclear to me at 
this point and neuropychological testing as an outpatient would 
be helpful (could not perform during this admission due to the 
language barrier) for diagnostic clarification. Differential 
diagnosis includes underlying neurodevelopmental disorder. Of 
note, although she reported feeling depressed at times, she did 
not appear dysphoric/dysthymic on my examination-- I do not 
believe she was suffering from a depressive episode, nor was 
there any evidence of mania on my examination. In addition, her 
thought process was mostly linear, goal oriented and she did not 
appear to be responding to internal stimuli-- she did not appear 
to be acutely psychotic on my examination, although her history 
does suggest some underlying paranoia. In addition, nothing in 
her history to suggest a history of prior drug or alcohol use-- 
I do not believe substance use was contributing to her current 
presentation. Medical workup was benign other than anemia, I do 
not believe an underlying medical cause was contributing. 
. 
# Safety/Legal: Patient was admitted to ___ on a ___ and signed a conditional voluntary form, which was accepted. 
She maintained her safety throughout her hospitalization on 15 
minute checks and did not require physical or chemical 
restraints during her hospitalization. 
.
# Unspecified Mood Disorder: as noted above 
- Patient maintained good behavioral control in the milieu and 
was compliant in meeting with her treatment team. 
- For reported depression and due to concerns for paranoia, we 
did discuss the risks and benefits of Abilify, which was started 
at 5 mg po qd. Of note, she tolerated this well with no reported 
side effects
- Of note, by time of discharge, patient was consistently 
denying suicidal ideation or thoughts of self harm. She was 
notably linear, goal and future oriented with plan to follow up 
with her outpatient providers.  
.
# Microcytic Anemia - CBC showed MCV of 66 and Hgb of 9.1.
- Fe studies in support of iron deficiency anemia
- provide Fe nutritional supplement
- recommend follow up with PCP for further treatment/improvement
