recall ___ at 5 minutes. No evidence of hemineglect. No 
left-right confusion. Able to follow both midline and 
appendicular commands.

- Cranial Nerves: PERRL 3->2 sluggish. VF full to finger 
movement and no extinction. EOMI, no nystagmus. Right V3 
impaired to light touch (90% normal), but fully intact to 
temperature and pinprick. Mild right nasolabial fold flattening. 
Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally. Palate elevation 
symmetric. SCM/Trapezius strength ___ bilaterally. Tongue 
midline and with good force bilaterally on tongue-in-cheek 
testing. Dysarthria most prominent with labial > dental > 
palatal sounds.

  [___]
L ___ 5 surgical ___ 
R ___ (History of left foot drop)

- Reflexes:
[Bic] [Tri] [___] [Quad] [Gastroc]
L 2+ 2+ 2+ bandaged 2
R2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2 
Plantar response mute bilaterally

- Sensory: Decreased to light touch right V3 as noted above. 
Decreased to all modalities in 10cm diameter area surrounding 
right patella (and reportedly left bandaged patella as well) 
secondary to nerve injury from knee surgeries.

- Coordination: Mild dysmetria on left with finger to nose and 
mirror movements. Good speed and intact cadence with rapid 
finger tapping movements bilaterally.

- Gait: Deferred due to knee surgery.

-Cranial Nerves: Surgical pupils bilaterally. EOMI without 
nystagmus. Facial sensation diminished on right in V2 and V3 
distributions to 90-95% of left side. Face symmetric at rest and

symmetrically. ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally. Tongue 
protrudes in midline.

-Coordination: No intention tremor or dysmetria on FTN 
bilaterally.
