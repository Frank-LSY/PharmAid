CT Chest ___: Diffuse pericardial enhancement + small 
effusion c/w pericarditis- etiology thought to be viral per 
discussion w/ MD. ___ reactive lymph nodes. Scattered 
areas of subpleural scarring/nodularity. Nonspecific hepatic 
hypodensities.  
.  
2d Echo ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function 
is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic 
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral 
valve. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal 
limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.  
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis. Hyperdynamic left 
ventricular function. Normal valvular function. Small 
pericardial effusion. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.  
.  
EKG: T wave inversions noted V1-V5
