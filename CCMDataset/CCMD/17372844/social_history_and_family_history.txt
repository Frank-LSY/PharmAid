PERTINENT STUDIES
=========================
CXR (___)
No acute intrathoracic process.
 
CT HEAD (___)
No acute intracranial process.
 
MRI / MRA BRAIN (___)
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Artifact to the level of the sella.  Degree of narrowing 
right paraclinoid ICA cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, normal MRA 
brain.
 
EXERCISE STRESS EKG (___)
No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Appropriate hemodynamic response to exercise. Good functional 
capacity.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ woman with PMHx notable for 
hypertension, obesity, and prior smoking who presented for 
sudden onset left upper and lower extremity parasthesias and 
weakness, as well as chest pressure.
 
# PARASTHESIAS / WEAKNESS
Initially presented for sudden onset of left leg and left arm 
weakness with associated parasthesias of the left face and left 
limbs. Presented to ED where CT head demonstrated no acute 
intracranial process. Symptoms mostly improved by time of 
arrival to floor however did note residual 4+/5 weakness in left 
arm and leg with flexion and extension. MRI / MRA without 
concerning findings. Overall unclear etiology for symptoms 
though reassuring against CVA/TIA. If symptoms persist then 
consider referral to neurologist.
 
# CHEST PAIN
Upon arrival to ED further described intermittent chest pressure 
with possible exertional component while climbing stairs. EKG 
without ischemic changes. Troponin negative x2. Never with 
hypoxia or abnormalities on continuous telemetry. Underwent ETT 
which demonstrated no anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG 
changes. Appropriate hemodynamic response to exercise with good 
functional capacity. A1c 5.3 with ASCVD risk only 2.1% over ___ 
years, and so was not started on aspirin or statin at this time. 
Pain did not recur while hospitalized. 
 
CHRONIC ISSUES
=================================
 
# HYPERTENSION
Normotensive. Continued home lisinopril.
 
# Hx MIGRAINES
Headache resolved prior to arrival. Unclear if related to acute 
neurological symptoms as discussed above.
 
# ANXIETY 
Stable.
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
=================================
 
[ ] If persistent symptoms of paresthesias then consider 
referral to a neurologist.
