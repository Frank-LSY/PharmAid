Physical Exam:
Day of initial presentation:
Pelvic Exam: Grossly normal external female genitalia
BME:  Slightly enlarged fibroid uterus ___ wks siz, uterus is 
?mid-position (vs ?AV sl dev to R) with the dominant L post 
fibroid extending to LUS crowding post cul-de-sac (difficult to 
r/o RV uterus given post myoma).  There is also a bulge in R ant 
LUS (? AV UT sl dev to R vs ___ R ant IM fibroid).  In addition, 
there is a NT 1.5-2 cm firm nodule palpated along the L anterior 
vaginal fornix at 1:00 (DDX: vag wall nodule vs subserosal 
fibroid in lower pelvis). (note: This lesion is better palpated 
on BME than visualized on SSE).  Overall pelvic exam findings 
are benign, no rebound or guarding, no tenderness throughout.
SSE: Patulous cervix consistent with multiparity.  No unusual 
lesions, discharge, or bleeding.  Again, without BME, vaginal 
lesion is difficult to appreciate on visualization alone.
VAGINAL EXAM: There was no clinically significant prolapse
Musculoskeletal: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. No cords
