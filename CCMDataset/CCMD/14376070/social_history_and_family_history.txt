Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain status 
post a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on ___ at ___ 
with Dr. ___.  Admission labs revealed elevated LFTs 
despite downtrending LFTs at the time of discharge from ___ 
after the lap chole. She was a transfer from an OSH, and had a 
CT scan there showing fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa, 
but repeat read here showed no fluid collections. A discussion 
was begun with the GI service here regarding ERCP; however, GI 
felt an MRCP would be more appropriate for this case, and this 
was obtained on ___. The patient tolerated the procedure 
well, and remained floor in stable condition, with some 
improvement of symptoms but still some RUQ/epigastric abdominal 
discomfort/mild pain. Her symptoms remained mild, with 
downtrending LFTs, but she was kept NPO after midnight for two 
nights in a row in preparation for ERCP the next day due to the 
continued RUQ/epigastric discomfort. MRCP did not demonstrate a 
retained stone, but due to continued symptoms and the low 
sensitivity of MRCP for possible sludge prompted a conversation 
between Dr. ___ the GI attending about whether the 
patient would benefit from ERCP and sphincterotomy. Ultimately, 
the patient was given a PO challenge (with fatty foods) on the 
evening of HD#3, which she tolerated well with no symptoms. On 
HD#4, she remained asymptomatic, and the decision was made for 
discharge with post-operative follow-up as originally scheduled.
