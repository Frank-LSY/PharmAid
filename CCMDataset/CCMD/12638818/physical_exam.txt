NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented.  Able to relate history without
difficulty.  Language is fluent with intact repetition and 
normal
prosody.  There were no paraphasic errors.  Pt. was able to name
both high and low frequency objects on the stroke card.

the cookie jar picture with detail.  Able to read without
difficulty.  Speech was not dysarthric.  Able to follow both
midline and appendicular commands. There was no evidence of
neglect.

finger
counting.

alternating
movements with normal and symmetric cadence and speed.
