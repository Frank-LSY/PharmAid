PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  
Dx'd grade ___ follicular lymphoma involving her cervical nodes
___. Cytogenetics showed 14q32 (IGH rearrangement). She 
noted
some neck pain in late ___ after slipping on the stairs,
following which she developed a left sided sore throat. She was
initially treated with Pen for tonsillar enlargement without
improvement and she was seen by Dr ___ in ENT who
appreciated extensive additional cervical adenopathy, confirmed
by chest and neck CT scans.  Endoscopic exam showed normal
vallecula, epiglottis, piriform sinus, false and true vocal
cords.  Her enlarged tonsillar tissue extends down to the
hypopharynx and slightly longer descent on the left than the
right.  FNA by Dr ___ lymphoma and she then underwent
an excisional bx at the ___ that confirmed a CD10+ B cell
follicular lymphoma.  Ki67 was ___.  She denies any wt loss,
fevers, night sweats or pruritis.  Continues to have discomfort
swallowing although feels a bit better since the largest node 
was
removed.   Mild pain left anterior chest for several weeks
intermittantly.  Wonders about possible chemical exposure 
growing
up near a airport where lots of chemicals were used.

Chest CT scan MEEI: No hilar or mediastinal adenopathy.  Mult
small liver lesions (? Cysts).

Exam notable for enlarged tonsils and bulky cervical and
supraclavicular nodes.

Labs showed normal CBC, LDH, immunoelectrophoresis  and slightly
elevated beta 2 microglobulin (2.7). Negative hep serologies. 
MRI showed multiple liver cysts. 

___: 4 weekly infusions of Rituxan.  Tolerated well. 
Adenopathy decreased but still present.

___: First maintenance Rituxan.

___ maintenance Rituxan deferred due to lesions on
tonsils.  Seen by Dr ___ felt they were tonsillar stones
and not worrisome.

___ maintenance Rituxan.  Small left low cervical nodes
present (2 cm).

___: PET scan at ___ - Massive conglomerate of lymph 
nodes
along the entire left cervical chain with intense FDG avidity
(14.4). No evidence of right sided cervical lymphadenopathy.  
1.5
cm non-FDG avid left breast mass.

___: Core bx of left cervical node showed follicular
lymphoma but with high Ki 67 index (5%-50% focally) and new
cytogenetic changes:

46,XX[7]
INTERPRETATION/COMMENT:  55% of the metaphase lymph node cells
examinedhad an abnormal karyotype with the t(14;18)(q32;q21)
translocation thatFISH has confirmed has resulted in the 
IGH/BCL2
gene rearrangement (seebelow) and several other chromosome
aberrations.  There was no evidenceof rearrangement of the BCL6
and MYC genes.  These findings areconsistent with transformation
of low grade follicular lymphoma to a higher grade.

___: Cycle 1 Rit/CHOP.  Used chlortrimazole troches for
probable thrush.

___: Cycle 2 Rit/CHOP.

___: Cycle 3 Rit/CHOP. Pred tapered at end.

___: PET scan showed marked interval decrease in size and
avidity of left cervical mass. (SUV 3.3 from 14.4).  Mild
residual asymmetric soft tissue fullness.

___: Cycle 4 Rit/CHOP - pred taper.

___ Cycle 5 Rit/CHOP.
