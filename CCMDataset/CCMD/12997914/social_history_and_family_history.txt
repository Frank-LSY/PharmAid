Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted after undergoing an incisional hernia 
repair with polypropylene mesh overlay in the right lower 
quadrant just right of midline. She tolerated the procedure 
well. She did experience some post-operative nausea and one 
episode of emesis; she has had PONV in the past and received a 
scopolamine patch. Her pain was well controlled with oxycodone 
and Tylenol with occasional IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain. 
She made good urine output and voided without difficulty after 
surgery; she did not undergo catheterization during the case or 
afterwards. She passed flatus. She received subcutaneous heparin 
for DVT prophylaxis. Her home medications were continued in the 
hospital. On POD1 she tolerated a regular diet, ambulated 
independently, and expressed her readiness for discharge home.
