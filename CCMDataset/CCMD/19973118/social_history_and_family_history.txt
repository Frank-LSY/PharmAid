Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#Major depressive episode - On admission to the unit, the 
patient endorsed suicidal ideation with plan to jump in front of 
a car or a train, as well as depressed mood, anhedonia, 
decreased sleep, insomnia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue/loss 
of energy, worthlessness/guilt, diminished concentration, 
hopelessness, and recurrent thoughts of death. Upon presentation 
to the unit the patient spent her whole first day in bed, and 
declined to attend groups.
.
The patient's presentation and history appear to be most 
consistent with a major depressive episode. Her suicidal 
ideation and depressive symptoms occurred in the setting of a 
number of significant stressors, namely pressure from her family 
to complete a major she dislikes, pressure from her school/peers 
in the form of group projects she is expected to complete, and 
significant social isolation after moving away from her family 
in ___, and then moving to ___ where she has struggled to 
make friends. The patient's social isolation appears to be 
playing a major role in her depressive symptoms. Since the 
patient moved to ___ over ___ years ago, she has struggled to 
make friends in the area. The patient also lives with her aunt 
and uncle, who she feels disapprove of her behavior and think 
she is "lazy" and "addicted" to video games.
.
While the patient was in the hospital, we re-started her home 
dose of fluoxetine 20 mg, which the patient discontinued four 
days before presenting to the emergency department. We then 
increased her fluoxetine to 30 mg daily. Because social 
isolation appears to be a significant component of the patient's 
distress, we encouraged the patient to engage with other 
patients in the milieu and attend groups.
.
Upon discharge from the unit the patient was seen to be more 
present in the milieu. She attended groups and was seen 
interacting with other patients in the milieu.
.
We also recommend intensive outpatient treatment or partial 
hospitalization to ease her transition back into the community. 
We also recommend that the patient see a therapist once per week 
after discharge. Because social isolation appears to be playing 
a significant role in her depressive symptoms, we have 
encouraged the patient to attend some form of group therapy once 
per week. 
.
#Restricted eating
Upon presentation the patient endorsed a recent 10 pound weight 
loss. She endorsed frequent restriction of her food intake and a 
desire to be thinner. She reported that she saw her depression, 
with concomitant loss of appetite, as an opportunity to lose 
weight. Because the patient endorsed some strange beliefs about 
food which may have represented misinformation, a nutrition 
consult was placed for nutritional education. The nutritionist 
recommended weekly blind weights and nutritional supplements 
with meals, as well as a daily multivitamin which will be 
continued after discharge.
.
3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS
The patient did not endorse any active substance use and her 
utox and serum tox did not reveal the presence of any substances 
in her body.
.
4. MEDICAL
No active medical conditions.
.
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. After 
initially declining the patient attended some groups including 
coping skills. The patient initially spent most of her day in 
bed but was gradually seen more in the milieu interacting 
appropriately with other patients.
.
#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Collateral information was obtained from the patient's cousin, 
who is her closest friend in the area and who lives with her. In 
addition, collateral information was obtained from Dr. ___ 
___, the patient's outpatient psychiatrist.
.
RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based on her intrusive 
suicidal ideation with a plan to jump in from of traffic or in 
front of a moving train. Her static risk factors noted at that 
time include a history of depression, young age, and single 
marital status. The patient's modifiable risk factors included 
suicidal ideation with plan, medication noncompliance, 
hopelessness, social withdrawal, limited coping skills, and lack 
of purpose. These modifiable risk factors were addressed by 
restarting the patient's medication and encouraging her to 
interact in the milieu and attend groups in order to ameliorate 
her feelings of social isolation and build skills for after 
discharge. She is being discharged with protective risk factors 
including a help-seeking nature, sense of responsibility to 
family, positive therapeutic relationship with outpatient 
providers, and lack of suicidal ideation. Overall, at time of 
discharge, patient was no longer at acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm such that she required ongoing inpatient psychiatric 
admission.
