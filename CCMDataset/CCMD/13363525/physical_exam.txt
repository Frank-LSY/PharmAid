impersistent, history is somewhat tangential and
self-contradictory. Partially redirectably. Inattentive, able to
recite ___ backwards slowly and with one error, before freezing
on ___. Language is fluent with intact repetition and
comprehension of midline, appendicular but not cross-body
commands. Naming in tact to high and low frequency objects. 
There
were no paraphasic errors. Speech was not dysarthric.  Able to
follow both midline and appendicular commands. Pt. was able to
register 3 objects and but could not recall any at 5 minutes. 
The pt. had good knowledge of current events ___). 

There was no evidence of apraxia or left-right confusion.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: R pupil 4 to 2mm and brisk. L pupil is post-surgical and
irregular. VFF to confrontation with finger counting. Both eyes
have sufficient acuity to count fingers accurately.
III, IV, VI: EOMI. There is combined rightward horizontal and
rotary nystagmus on rightward gaze. Could not cooperate with HIT
due to attention. No skew. Occasionally hypometric saccades.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch, pinprick in all
distributions.
VII: No consistent asymmetry, excusion is full and strength is
full to confrontation in mouth closure, eye closure and
frontalis.
VIII: Hearing impaired bulaterally, wearing hearing aids.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, and is equal ___ strength
bilaterally as evidenced by tongue-in-cheek testing.
 
-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally. THere is postural and intention tremor noticed in
arms bilaterally, more prominent on the right than on the left.
No asterixis.

bilaterally,
but worse on the right than on the left. Could not reliably
descriminate sharp and dull on body (but could on face). Also
endorsed hyperesthesia in a stocking distribution bilaterally.

tapping is slow and irregular.  No dysmetria on HKS bilaterally.

###Discharge Exam###
Upon discharge, she was awake, alert with fluent speech and at 
times frontal. She was moving all extremities antigravity with 
similar baseline weakness as described above. She has bilateral 
postural and intention tremor R>L.
