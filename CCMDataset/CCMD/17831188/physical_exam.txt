ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM
==========================
Vitals: 
Temperature: 98.5 
Blood pressure: 138/83 
Heart rate: 67 
Respiratory rate: 16 
Oxygen saturation: 100% 

General examination: 
General: Comfortable and in no distress 
Head: No irritation/exudate from eyes, nose, throat 
Neck: Supple with no pain to flexion or extension 
Cardio: Regular rate and rhythm, warm, no peripheral edema 
Lungs: Unlabored breathing 
Abdomen: Soft, non tender, non distended 
Skin: No rashes or lesions
MSK: Hand and feet with significant deformity bilaterally 

Neurologic:
Mental Status:
Patient speaks ___ and per his son and daughter there were
no errors in speech production.  Patient is alert to name,
location, date, and reason as to why he is in hospital.  His 
fund
of knowledge is appropriate.  He answers questions appropriately
and is able to perform months of the year backwards without
mistake.  Naming and repetition intact.  Right, left
differentiation intact.  Calculations intact.  He can follow at
least two step commands.  

Cranial Nerves:
He has mild anisocoria with right pupil smaller than left pupil
by less than 1 mm.  Both are briskly reactive to light. 
Patient's eyes not conjugate.  His right pupil sits downward and
inward.  He buries sclera with abduction bilaterally.  No
nystagmus.  No ptosis.  Cover and uncover with no skew.  He 
could
not understand the HIT, therefore it could not be done.  Left 
lip
droop that corrects with smile.  Hearing of finger rubbing not
heard from right ear, but he hears light finger snapping.  Uvula
midline and palate raises symmetrically.  Shoulders sit
symmetrically.  Tongue to midline with forceful lateral
excursions.  

-Motor: Normal bulk and tone throughout. No pronator drift.

Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, temperature, 
vibration, or proprioception throughout. No extinction to DSS.
Romberg absent. 

Reflexes:
  [Bic] [Tri] [___] [Pat] [Ach]
L   2     2      2      2     1
R   2     2      2      2     1 
Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

Coordination: 
No eye dysmetria. No dysmetria with finger nose finger or heal 
to
shin.  No asymmetric rebound.  No over shoot with mirroring. No
truncal ataxia when patient asked to sit up.  When he stood he
was very unstable and had to keep a wide based gait or he would
certainly fall.  No retropulsion. 

Gait: 
Unable to walk, please see coordination, he is at high risk for
fall.
