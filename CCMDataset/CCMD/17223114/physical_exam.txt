PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION 
GEN - well appearing, well developed
HEENT - NC/AT, MMM
NECK - full ROM, no meningismus
CV - RRR
RESP - normal WOB
ABD - soft, NT, ND
EXTR - atraumatic, WWP

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
MS - Awake, alert, oriented x 3. Attention to examiner easily
attained and maintained. Concentration maintained when recalling
months backwards. Recalls a coherent history, though uses notes
to do so, and does forget to mention a few points that I have to
go back and prompt her for. Structure of speech demonstrates
fluency with full sentences, and normal prosody. No paraphasic
errors. Intact repetition, naming, reading, and comprehension.
Verbal registration ___, recalls ___ spontaneously, and ___ with
MC. No evidence of apraxia or neglect.

CN - [II] PERRL 3->2 brisk. VF full to number counting. [III, 
IV,
VI] EOMI, no nystagmus. [V] V1-V3 without deficits to light 
touch
bilaterally. [VII] No facial movement asymmetry with forced
eyelid closure or volitional smile. [VIII] Hearing intact to
finger rub bilaterally. [IX, X] Palate elevation symmetric. No
dysarthria. [XI] SCM/Trapezius strength ___ bilaterally. [XII]
Tongue midline with full ROM.

MOTOR - Normal bulk and tone. No pronation, no drift. No 
orbiting
with arm roll. No tremor or asterixis.

SENSORY - Reports area of decreased sensation in the distal L
thumb. Denies sensory loss in the R hand ("it's only when I put
my thumb and pointer finger together"). Reports "pins and
needles" parasthesia in bilateral feet; but sensation intact to
LT, PP, and proprioception.

R 2      2      2      2        2
Plantar response flexor bilaterally.

COORD - No dysmetria with finger to nose testing. Good speed and
intact cadence with rapid alternating movements. Negative
Romberg.

GAIT - Normal initiation. Narrow base. Normal stride length and
arm swing. Stable without sway.
