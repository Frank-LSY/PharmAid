nystagmus. Normal saccades. VFF to confrontation. Visual acuity
___ bilaterally. Fundoscopic exam revealed no papilledema,
exudates, or hemorrhages.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.

XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk throughout. Increased tone on the left >
right upper extremity, likely paratonia but possibly some
spasticity on the left side. No pronator drift bilaterally. No
adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. No asterixis
noted.
