Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Poor historian. Attentive,
able to name ___ backward without difficulty. Language is fluent

VII: There is slight asymmetry of the eyelids, with the left
eyelid resting higher on the orbit than the right. Resists eye
opening with full strength. There is no other facial asymmetry.
