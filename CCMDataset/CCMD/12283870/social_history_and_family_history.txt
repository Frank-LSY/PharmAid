Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with recurrent oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma s/p total laryngopharyngectomy with L thigh flap 
with subsequent persistent and progressive disease who presents 
___ after episode of bleeding from back of mouth from 
recurrent 5.2cm R posterior oropharyngeal mass. He was initially

to medicine for continued monitoring of hemodynamic stability.
 
ACUTE ISSUES
===============
#Posterior oropharyngeal cancer
History of left base-of-tongue SCC s/p chemoXRT in ___issection in ___ and recent second primary of 
the posterior oropharynx in ___ s/p total laryngopharyngectomy 
with L thigh flap and a positive margin in the nasopharynx in 
___ at Mass Eye & Ear with subsequent persistent and 
progressive disease who presents ___ after episode of 
bleeding from back of mouth, about ___ cup. He was HDS on 
admission with no hypoxia. On exam, he had a large exophytic 
mass in the posterior oropharynx with spots of blood, no large 
active bleeding, as well as a L neck sub-cm opening with 
purulent drainage, which was chronic. CTA was performed and did 
not demonstrate any actively bleeding vessel, though did 
demonstrate a lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass arising 
from the right posterior oropharynx measuring up to 5.2 cm, 
consistent with known recurrent oral SCC. He was treated with 
Acetaminophen w/Codeine as needed for pain with chewing. He did 
not have any repeat episodes of large-volume bleeding and 
remained HDS with stable H/H. He was discharged with 
instructions for packing which will be done by his supportive 
family. 
 
#L neck flap dehiscence
Sub-cm dehiscence noted with purulent discharge. ENT followed 
and recommended L neck packing for the purulent neck drainage, 
did not recommend any other acute interventions.
 
#Coordination of care
#Goals of care
Patient's oncology care is managed by Dr. ___ 
SCC is not resectable) and Dr. ___. Dr. ___
