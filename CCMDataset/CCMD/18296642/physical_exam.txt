some difficulty remembering when events happened. Attentive. 
Language is fluent with intact repetition and comprehension. 
Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors. Speech was not

commands. Pt was able to register ___ objects on immediate 
repetition. After 5 minutes, he recalled ___ with category

 Plantar response was flexor bilaterally though with a brisk 
withdrawal (attributes to being ticklish).

-Coordination: No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally. Left FNF 
was slower and a mild tremor was present (also at rest). During 
HKS, there was some posturing of the right hand in a flexed
