Reports/Imaging:
======================
CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of 
pneumoperitoneum. 
.
Colonoscopy ___:
Findings: 
Contents: Bright red blood and clots were seen in the colon from 
the rectum to the ascending colon.  
.
Excavated Lesions: A single ulcer was found at the site of 
recent polypectomy at approximately 15cm. There was active 
extravasation of bright red blood on one aspect of the site. 
Three endoclips were successfully applied to the polypectomy 
site for the purpose of hemostasis. 8 cc.Epinephrine ___ 
injection was applied for hemostasis with success.  
.
Other: Giving findings and intervention at the site of 
polypectomy, as well as the fact that the other interventions 
were biopsies and not polypectomies, the decision was made to 
end the procedure once hemostasis had been confirmed t the 15 cm 
polypectomy site. The most proximal area examined was the 
ascending colon at approximately 35cm.  
.
Impression: Ulcer in the colon (endoclip, injection)
Blood in the colon
Giving findings and intervention at the site of polypectomy, as

The most proximal area examined was the ascending colon at 
approximately 35cm.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to ascending colon

overnight with flexeril and tylenol. No further episodes of 
bleeding occurred aside from directly after the procedure.
