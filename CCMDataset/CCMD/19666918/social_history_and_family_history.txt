>> Pertinent Imaging: 
CT Head: 
1. Acute extensive right cerebral hemispheric subdural hematoma 
causing subfalcine herniation to the left, probable 
transtentorial herniation, causing brainstem edema. 
2. Left sided obstructive hydrocephalus is seen.
3. No evidence of skull fracture is seen
4. No evidence of space occupying lesion could be found
5. The current plain CT scan of the brain shows no diagnostic 
evidence of acute cerebral infarction. 
6. Left Occipital scalp acute hematoma is also present. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male, with past history of

hemorrhage, with imaging evidence of sub-falcine herniation, 
transtentorial herniation and concern for an obstructive 
hydrocephalus. For this, patient was intubated, sedated, and 
transferred to ___ for neurosurgical evaluation. Patient was 
evaluated in the ED and given grave prognosis and irreversible
