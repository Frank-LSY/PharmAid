evidence of apraxia or neglect. Registers ___ objects, gets ___
with categories, unable to get last one even with options. 

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI full with right
beating end gaze nystagmus when looking to the right that
extinguishes, left beating torsional nystagmus when looking to
the left, no nystagmus with up or down gaze, worsening dizziness
with left gaze, Fundoscopic exam showed right optic disc with
hyperpigmentation around disc, left with mild nasal blurring but
no overt papilledema, no hyperpigmentation on left.  Left
homonymous hemianopia, worse in upper quadrant
V: facial sensation on initial examination intact to light touch
V1-V3, repeat exam patient noted "subtle" difference on left
V1-V3 to LT, decreased pinprick left V1-V3, decreased temp left
V1-V2, V3 was symmetric.  
VII: left facial asymmetry (per friends is always asymmetric but
looks worse today), dissociation with emotional smile 
VIII: Hearing intact to conversation
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with good excursions. Strength
full with tongue-in-cheek testing.

-Motor: Normal bulk, mildly increased tone in left lower
extremity, with pronator drift testing left arm starts to bounce
up and down slightly with some pseudoathethoid movements of
fingers, left upper with mild pronation and cupping without
drift, left leg does the same bouncing without drift 
 No asterixis noted.

** for all left side patient would have brief moments of full
strength but examiner could break consistently, unclear if
actually weak or due to ataxia and difficulty coordinating
movements 

-Sensory: decreased sensation to pinprick in left arm and leg
(10% compared to right), decreased sensation to temperature on
the left arm and leg compared to the right. 
 patient is unable to perceive vibration in bilateral toes,
intact in ankles bilaterally, intact in bilateral upper
extremities, proprioception was absent on left big toe, patient
was unable to get many of the movements at the ankle as well on
the left, said "I am just guessing", proprioception intact and
right big toe to large movements, per perception decrease in
bilateral upper extremities as well with ___ out of 5 mistakes 
in
bilateral fingers.  Similar to the face patient initially tells
me that light touch is symmetric and intact in upper and lower
extremity but later says that there is a very subtle difference
in left side just feels off compared to the right
No extinction to DSS.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.
*Cross adductors and suprapatella on the left 

-Coordination: With arms outstretched patient has rebound in the
left upper extremity to light tap, he has bilateral intention
tremor with finger to nose, left side he also has some mild
overshoot with finger to nose, heel to shin on the left is very
slow and uncoordinated, finger tapping on the left is slow and
uncoordinated rate is fast and smooth, he is unable to do
sequential finger tapping on the left, able to do on the right,
no truncal ataxia while sitting on the side of the bed with his
arms crossed

-Gait: Able to stand up from the bed unassisted, gait very wide
based,  gait is very slow and mildly unsteady.  He is able to
walk without holding onto me they gets very dizzy and feels very
unsteady when turning.  Unable to do tandem or Romberg due to
unsteadiness with regular gait
