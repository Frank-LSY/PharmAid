Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology 
service after undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy and 
bilateral salpingectomy. Please see the operative report for 
full details.
Intra-operative urine output was low (~10 cc/hr) due to 
obstruction by the uterus on the ureters. Urine output returned 
to adequate levels post-operatively and her post-operative 
course was uncomplicated. Immediately post-op, her pain was 
controlled with a transversus abdominus plane block, 
hydromorphone PCA, and ketorolac.
On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her 
foley was removed and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to oral 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and oxycodone. 
By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She remained under observation 
in the hospital until post-operative day 2 for further 
monitoring and pain control. She was then discharged home in 
stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.
