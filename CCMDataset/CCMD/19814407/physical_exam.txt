left, no dysmetria on FnF.

Discharge Physical Exam:
Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Her speech is somewhat 
hesitant, takes many pauses before speaking. She tends to repeat 
herself, and perseverates. Attentive, able to name ___ backward 
without difficulty. She has trouble with repetition, though this 
may have been limited by hearing (says ___ is the one to help 
today" instead of "I only know that ___ is the one to help 
today", and "the cat hit under the couch" instead of "the cat 
always hid under the couch when the dog was in the room". 
Comprehension is impaired as well, also possibly limited by 
hearing. For example, when asked to touch her finger to her nose 
(finger specified by examiner) she says "which finger" and it 
takes repetition of command several times for her to understand, 
despite the fact she has been asked to do this every day for the 
past 12 days. Her speech is halting, but normal prosody. There 
were no paraphasic errors. Able to name both high and low 
frequency objects. Able to read with difficulty very large text. 
Trouble with drawing a cube and clock on MOCA testing. No 
dysarthria. Able to register ___ objects and recall ___ at 5 
minutes without cues. There was no evidence of apraxia or 
neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:

II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk, post surgical, 
narrow palpebral fissure on left (chronic). EOMI without 
nystagmus. Eyes are orthotropic in primary position. Right 
homonymous hemianopia with finger counting, cannot count fingers 
until directly in her field of vision on the right, the left 
upper quadrant also is restricted to finger count, less so than 
the left lower quadrant. 
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: Left NLFF but strong eye closure and lip closure, scar on
philtrum from prior surgery 
VIII: Decreased hearing bilaterally, which is chronic but 
worsened over the past month. Hearing aids in place. 
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with good excursions. Strength
full with tongue-in-cheek testing.

-Motor: Normal bulk and tone throughout. No pronation or drift 
bilaterally.

-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick throughout. No

-Reflexes:
reflexes slightly more brisk on left, with suprapatellar on the 
left but not on the right. Toes mute bilaterally. 

-Coordination: No dysmetria on FNF. Slight intention tremor 
bilaterally. Slowed finger tapping bilaterally. 

-Gait: Good initiation. Ambulating independently around the 
halls with narrow-based, normal stride and arm swing but slight 
stoop to right. Turns very quickly and almost appears off 
balance.
