IMAGING
==================
CXR (___):  
No comparison. Normal lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly with 
enlargement of the left atrium. Moderate elongation of the 
descending aorta. The presence of a small left pleural effusion 
cannot be excluded. No overt pulmonary edema. Minimal 
retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumonia. Status post left 
axillary lymph node dissection.  
--------------- 
CTA (___):  
1. Bilateral lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary 
emboli, and right upper lobe segmental pulmonary emboli. No CT 
evidence of right heart strain.  
2. Dense consolidations at the bilateral lung bases may 
represent atelectasis, however a component of pulmonary 
infarction cannot be excluded.  
3. Trace left pleural effusion.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH breast cancer s/p lobectomy, radiation, and 
chemotherapy who presented with pleuritic upper back pain, cough 
and was found to have pulmonary embolisms. Based on history this 
is unprovoked. She has no history to suggest travel, immobility, 
or surgery. She does have a history of breast cancer in 
remission last seen by heme/onc on ___. CT scan showed 
bilateral lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary 
emboli, and right upper lobe segmental pulmonary emboli. She was 
started on heparin gtt and was transitioned to apixaban. 
Initially metoprolol was held to allow physiologic tachycardia, 
but was restarted on discharge. On day of discharge, she 
ambulated without hypoxia or symptoms.
