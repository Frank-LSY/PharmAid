Pulmonary: Normal work of breathing
Cardiac: RRR, warm, well-perfused

___ maneuver was attempted, but she had a difficult 
time
cooperating due to symptoms of nausea, not clearly provoked by
maneuver.
 
Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history
without difficulty. Attentive, able to name ___ backward without

comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors.
Pt was able to name both high and low frequency objects.  Able 
to
read without difficulty. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to
follow both midline and appendicular commands. There was no
evidence of apraxia or neglect.
-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI without
nystagmus. Normal saccades. VFF to confrontation. 
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with good excursions. Strength
full with tongue-in-cheek testing.

vibratory sense, proprioception throughout. No extinction to 
DSS.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.  Pectoralis jerk 
present
bilaterally

-Coordination: No intention tremor. Normal finger-tap
bilaterally. No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.  No
overshoot with mirror testing.  When sitting at the edge of the
bed, there is significant truncal ataxia, and she wobbles and
nearly falls.

-Gait: Slow initiation due to unsteadiness.  Stance is narrow,
however her gait is very unsteady/ataxic and she nearly fell
after a few short steps

Cardiac: warm, well-perfused
Abdomen: soft, non-distended
Extremities: No ___ edema.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
 
Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history 
without difficulty. Language is fluent with intact 
comprehension. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to
follow both midline and appendicular commands.

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm ___. EOMI without nystagmus. 
Normal saccades.  
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Negative head impulse test bilaterally; Weber localized to 
AD with BC > AC on ___. Deviated slightly to right on 
Unterberger.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with good excursions.

-Motor: Increased tone in BLE. No pronator drift bilaterally. No 
adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. Full power 
throughout.

-Sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout with normal 
vibration at distal BLE; decreased JPS noted, however, in distal 
LLE > RLE at MCP joints. No extinction to DSS. Very mild wobble 
on Romberg, but she was distractable. When writing a number on 
her forehead for her to identify while she was closing her eyes, 
she had less of a wobble. She was able to do the ___ 
test without any problems and she did not turn or deviate.

significant truncal ataxia. Gait: Hesitant though narrow-based 
and steady.
