Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o F presented to the ___ with N/V/D and abdominal 
pain, with RLQ>LLQ tenderness to palpation after having a recent 
episode of similar pain within the past month with CT scan 
concerning for possible inflammatory bowel disease, She was 
transferred for GI consultation and expedited workup, including 
MRE and possibly colonoscopy. Confounding the picture, she had 
recently returned from ___, thus making infectious 
gastroenteritis a concern prompting stool studies which were 
positive for C. diff. GI saw the patient and remained concerned 
about underlying IBD and were suspicious that this episode was 
unrelated and due to an infectious cause. Regardless, because 
she was positive for C. diff, the MRE had to be postponed to a 
later date due to having an active infection. At the time of 
discharge, her symptoms had improved and she was tolerating a 
regular diet. She was discharged on metronidazole to complete a 
14-day course. She will follow-up with GI as an outpatient to 
reschedule her MRE.
