Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented self, ___ ED, ___. Able 
to
relate history without difficulty. Attentive, able to name ___
backward though a little slow. Language is fluent with intact
repetition and comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no
paraphasic errors. Able to name both high and low frequency
objects. Sometimes would need to pause for word-finding to be
able to express himself. Able to read without difficulty. No
dysarthria. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands. There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves: 
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI; R beating
nystagmus 5 beats on R lateral endgaze. L horizontal diplopia on
L lateral endgaze. Normal saccades. VFF to confrontation.  
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with good excursions.  R 
appears
slightly weaker on tongue in cheek testing. 

-Motor: Normal bulk and tone throughout. No pronator drift. No
adventitious movements, such as tremor or asterixis noted.

Plantar response was equivocal bilaterally.

-Coordination: No intention tremor. L hand subtly clumsier on
finger tapping, slower sequential finger tapping as well. Pt
left-handed. Dysmetria on LUE on FNF a couple times. HKS more
difficult/effortful to perform with L leg, but not clearly
dysmetric. 

-Gait: Good initiation. Slightly wide-based, normal stride and
arm swing.  Unsteady tandem gait.
