PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
This patient was seen by PCP with an elevated creatinine in 
___
and was referred to Dr. ___ from ___ here at
___. The patient had a new diagnosis of kidney disease
with an elevated creatinine from ___ in ___. Initial
Ptn/Creat ratio was as high as 2.4. The patient also had a renal
ultrasound done on ___ that showed that both kidneys
appeared normal.   UPEP and urine IFE showed MULTIPLE PROTEIN
BANDS SEEN, WITH ALBUMIN ___ KAPPA 
DETECTED
REPRESENTED ROUGHLY 15% OF URINARY PROTEIN BASED ON THIS 
SAMPLE'S
PROTEIN/CREATININE RATIO AND ASSUMING DAILY CREATININE EXCRETION
OF 1000 MG THIS PATIENT'S ___ EXCRETION wAS estimated at
15% * 1.6 * 1000 = 240 MG/DAY. Based on this pt was referred to
us to r.o MM. We did not have prior lab data to compare. Serum
IFE demonstrated IgG Kappa M ptn with 0.7gm/dl of protein. He 
had
a negative skeletal survey on ___.  His free kappa lambda
ratio was 12.82 with a ___ microglobulin of 4.49. The patient
was not anemic, did not show any evidence of hypercalcemia.
- BM biopsy performed on ___ demonstrated hyperellular
marrow with kappa restricted lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with pos
MYD88 mutation detection. No plasma cell dyscrasia seen.
- ___: CT scans of the chest/abd/pelvis did not demonstrate 
and
adenopathy. Mild splenomegaly 13.2 cm was noted. Renal biopsy 
was
recommended by us to the nephrology team.
- ___: Underwent renal biopsy that demonstrated  acute on
chronic tubular injury, likely from the patient's known
___ proteinuria. Case was reviewed by hemepath who saw
evidence of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in the biopsy specimen 
but
this was felt to be a fragment of an inadvertently sampled LN
rather than actual renal involvement with lymphoma. Case
discussed with Dr ___ recommended treatment of the 
lymphoma
that was causing the ptnuria from acute on chronic tubular
injury. This was reflective of the nephrology team consensus.
- Given absence of symptomatic systemic lymphoma, it was decide
to start treatment with single agent Rituximab.
- ___ and ___ rcd 4 weekly doses of Rituxan.
- ___: PET demonstrated no e.o lymphoma or lytic lesions.  
- ___: Evaluated by Nephrology and felt to have improvement in
ptnuria which was lower at 1.3 compared to ___ previously.
Additionally the percent/amount of ___ proteinuria was
less than previous values, but not completely negative. However
continued to have glycosuria, hypouricemia, and hypophosphatemia
indicating continued proximal tubule wasting. With so little
___ protein in the urine, it was unclear if there is
ongoing injury with this small amount. 
- ___: Case discussed again and felt that we should add Velcade
and Dex to the regimen.  
- ___: Started on BDR regimen (Velcade/Dex and Rituximab) for
treatment of ongoing light chain proximal tubulopathy. Ptn/Creat
ratio was 1.6 gm/day before starting Velcade.
- Rcd Velcade at 1.3 mg/m2 IV on days 1,___ and ___. Tolerated
cycle 1 very well with no complications.  
- ___: Ptn/creat ration decreased to 1gm/day after cycle 1 of
Velcade. Rcd cycle 2 of BDR in which rcd Velcade given at 1.6
mg/m2 and Dex ___ mg along with Rituxan on days 1,___ and ___.
LFT's were elevated during course of Tx. Lipitor held. 
- Course complicated by brief episodes of dizziness and diarrhea
after Velcade doses for a few hours that resolved by itself.
- ___: Ptn/Creat ratio improved to 0.7 gm/day. Given episodes 
of
hypotension/dizziness post Velcade administration and concern 
for
autonomic neuropathy sec to Velcade , dose of Velcade was 
reduced
to 1.3 mg/m2 and cycle 3 administered. Tolerated well with
reduction in dose. 
- ___: Ptn/Creat ratio improved to 0.7 gm/day. Given
neuropathy,dose of Velcade was reduced further to 0.7 mg/m2 and
cycle 4 administered. Tolerated it well with reduction in dose.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Small colonic benign adenomatous polyp for which he will have
a repeat colonoscopy in ___ years.

last
