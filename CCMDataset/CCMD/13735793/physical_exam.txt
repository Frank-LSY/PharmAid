ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM
Physical Exam:
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: CTAB, no increased work of breathing
Cardiac: RRR, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or
organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history
without difficulty. Language is fluent with intact repetition 
and
comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors.
Pt was able to name both high and low frequency objects.  Able 
to
read without difficulty. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to
follow both midline and appendicular commands. There was no
evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. VFF to confrontation. 
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus. Normal saccades.
V: Decreased sensation to light touch in left V3 chronic.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

- Motor - Normal bulk and tone. No drift.
