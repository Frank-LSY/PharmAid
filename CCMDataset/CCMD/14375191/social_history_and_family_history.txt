WITH CONTRAST 
  
INDICATION:   ___ with chest pressure, new O2 requirement, and 
tachy// eval PE 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images were obtained through 
the thorax 
after the uneventful administration of intravenous contrast.  
Reformatted 
coronal, sagittal, thin slice axial images, and oblique maximal 
intensity 
projection images were submitted to PACS and reviewed. 
  
DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 
   1) Stationary Acquisition 1.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 9.1 mGy 
(Body) DLP = 4.6 
mGy-cm. 
   2) Spiral Acquisition 3.5 s, 27.3 cm; CTDIvol = 16.0 mGy 
(Body) DLP = 435.7 
mGy-cm. 
 Total DLP (Body) = 440 mGy-cm. 
  
COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
HEART AND VASCULATURE: Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified 
to the 
segmental level without filling defect to indicate a pulmonary 
embolus.  The 
pulmonary vasculature is prominent in bilateral lower lobes.  
The thoracic 
aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection or 
intramural 
hematoma.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within 
normal limits. 
No pericardial effusion is seen. 
  
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: No axillary, mediastinal, or 
hilar 
lymphadenopathy is present.  No mediastinal mass. 
  
PLEURAL SPACES: There are trace bilateral pleural effusions with 
adjacent 
atelectasis. 
  
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  A stable 6 
mm nodule seen 
in the left lower lobe (3; 69).  Small perifissural nodules in 
the right upper 
lobe are unchanged (3; 92).  There is mild predominantly lower 
lobe bronchial 
wall thickening.  The airways are patent to the level of the 
segmental bronchi 
bilaterally. 
  
BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no abnormality. 
  
ABDOMEN:  Included portion of the upper abdomen show a 3.5 x 2.8 
cm left lobe 
hepatic cyst.  Multiple additional subcentimeter hypodensities 
are seen 
throughout the liver which are too small to characterize but 
likely represent 
additional hepatic cysts. 
  
BONES: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no 
acute fracture. 
  
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. 
3. Lower lobe predominant bronchial wall thickening suggestive 
of bronchitis 
or related to mild interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation is 
recommended. 
4. Stable bilateral pulmonary nodules. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with a history of nephrolithiasis and
testicular cancer in remission ___ years who presents with
tachycardia and hypotension in the setting of recent colonoscopy
prep, likely dehydration with triggered AFib.
   
# Hypotension
# Tachycardia
# Acidosis 
___ labs with lactate of 2.6 which downtrended and now with
non-gap acidosis likely secondary to 6L IVFs he was given 
between
___ and ___. Likely tachycardia and hypotension related to
severe dehydration from ___ prep with resulting vomiting and
NPO. Additionally severity of dehydration likely triggered AFib
which compounded the hypotension. Vitals now normalized with 
mild
sinus tachycardia and without orthostasis. He was on a regular 
diet and had no other significant events on telemetry.  His 
orthostatic vital signs were normal and he did not require any 
antibiotics. 
  
#  AFib
New onset and temporary and already resolved by arrival to ___
ED. Likely acute trigger in setting of severe dehydration. Given
acute event, not likely to have AFib chronically and CHADS2 = 0
anyway so no need for AC. I spoke to patient about AC and risk 
of
stroke long term with AFib and he is aware and will speak to PCP
___ DC. ___ Metoprolol 25mg PO BID; He cannot have dilaitzem 
while on
statin; changed to 50mg XL on discharge. No AC needed but 
communicate to PCP on discharge to monitor for AFib long term, 
he will have a low risk of stroke for a while but need to 
consider down the line or if he develops new comorbidities
 
# Hyperbilirubinemia
Indirect, likely ___ from NPO and prep
 
# Pulmonary nodule
Chronic and stable, patient knows about them, apparently first
seen during chemo for testicular cancer ___ years ago, stable
since.
  
# HLD
- Continue Simvastatin
 
# ?Urinary retention: 
Foley placed in ED for high PVRs, but patient has no prior
history. Foley removed on ___ without any complications.  He 
had normal UOP post foley removal.
