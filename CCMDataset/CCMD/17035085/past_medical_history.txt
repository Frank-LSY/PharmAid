Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:  
Pt. initially presented last ___ with flank pain.  In ___, pt developed lymphadenopathy.  In ___, pt. discovered to 
have enlarged paraaortic LN, enlarged ovary.  In ___, TAH BSO 
and partial omentectomy performed.
Pathology noted the following: The omental biopsy revealed a 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type, arising in a 
background of follicular lymphoma. Right fallopian tube revealed 
the same and the right ovary revealed the same and this involved 
the myometrium, right fallopian tube and left ovary. The 
atypical lymphoid infiltrate involved the omentum, right ovary, 
right fallopian tube, and myometrium, as well as focally in the 
left ovary. These were LCA positive, CD20 positive with 
coexpression of bcl-2 and bcl-6 and CD10, which is consistent 
with a follicular derivation and mib-1 fraction was 20%. There 
were admixed CD3 and CD5 T- cells, both kappa and lambda 
positive cells were noted, but on flow cytometry, a monoclonal 
lambda B-cell proliferative disorder was appreciated. Overall, 
this was felt to be consistent with diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma with indications of follicular derivation. 
Pt. has been treated with R-CHOP and high-dose MTX for CNS ppx. 
Has also rec'ed rituxan. Course has been c/b inc. flank pain and 
TLS.
A restaging PET was performed during cycle 2 and revealed that 
most of the previously identified abnormal uptake in the 
cervical, mediastinal, retroperitoneal and inguinal adenopathy 
has resolved completely. Other lymph nodes have decreased in 
avidity. In the chest, there is an ill-defined opacity in the 
medial right lower lobe with an SUV of 4.2 and two tiny foci of 
increased uptake in the hilar region bilaterally, which are new 
in the interval without clearly identifiable nodules on the CT 
scans. A single lesion within the L4 vertebral body has 
increased FDG avidity.
