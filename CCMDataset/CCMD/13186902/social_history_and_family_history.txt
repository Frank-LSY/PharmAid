MICROBIOLOGY DATA: 
___ Blood cultures (x 2) - pending
___ Urine culture - no growth
.
IMAGING: 
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Lung volumes are low, with 
crowding of bronchovascular markings. There is no focal 
consolidation. Heart size is normal. There are no significant 
pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
.
___ CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON - There is no main, branch, 
lobar, or proximal segmental pulmonary embolus. Main pulmonary 
artery is enlarged to 3.4 cm, suggestive of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. The left and right branch arteries are also 
dilated, and there is pruning of the distal vasculature. Mild 
irregular central bronchial wall thickening is present, 
compatible with small airways disease. Mild bibasilar 
atelectasis is present, left greater than right. There is no 
evidence of mucus plugging or consolidation. No pleural 
effusions are present. Heart size is at the upper limits of 
normal, without pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is 
normal in caliber throughout. Axillary, mediastinal, and hilar 
lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged. Note is made of a 
moderate sliding hiatal hernia. There is bilateral pectoralis 
muscle hypertrophy.
.
___ 2D-ECHO / TTE - The left atrium and right atrium are 
normal in cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular 
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF > 75%). The estimated cardiac index is high 
(>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is no valvular 
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely 
related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and hyperdynamic 
global left ventricular systolic function.

aspergillosis, and post-streptococcal glomerlonephritis who 
presents with several days of URI symptoms and one day of fever, 
chills, cough, myalgias, tachypnea, and chest pain.
.
# ASTHMA EXACERBATION - The patient presented with a defined 
history of asthma which sounds mild-to-moderate and persistent 
based on symptom frequency, with poor preventative medication 
compliance. He has been prescribed long acting B2-agonist 
medication with inhaled corticosteroid and a leukotriene 
inhibitor which he only uses when he expects symptom 
exacerbation, periodically. He has no record of PFTs in our 
system. On admission, give his symptoms, we suspected a 
component of asthma exacerbation triggered by URI symptoms. His 
CXR showed no consolidation or effusion and a CTA chest was 
performed in the ED which showed concern for pulmonary HTN with 
mild left greater than right sided atelectasis without pulmonary 
embolism or consolidation concerning for pneumonia. He was 
placed on supplemental oxygen initially and quickly weaned to 
room air without issues; his oxygen saturations remained > 95% 
on room air the entire admission. His ambulatory saturation was 
94% prior to discharge. He did receive Methylprednisolone 125 mg 
IV x 1 in the ED; and was continued on Prednisone 60 mg PO x 
5-days (start date ___ for asthma exacerbation treatment with 
supplemental Albuterol, ipatropium nebulizers Q4-6H PRN 
wheezing. There were no indications for antibiotics this 
admission and remained afebrile with only a steroid-induced 
leukocytosis without bandemia. His PEF values remained at 
baseline. Given his poor medication compliance regarding asthma 
treatment, we restarted Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus (250/50) 1 
puff INH BID and Montelukast Sodium 10 mg PO daily without 
issue. We had our pharmacist discuss treatment compliance with 
him and demonstrate correct MDI device use. He will need 
outpatient monitoring for regimen compliance, possibly PFTs, and 
PEF monitoring. He also had a reassuring infectious work-up 
prior to discharge with a negative U/A, negative CXR as noted 
above and negative blood cultures. 
.
# (?) SUSPECTED PULMONARY HYPERTENSION - The patient presented 
with no history of pulmonary HTN, but his presentation is 
significant for progressive exertional dyspnea with minimal 
activity, associated with fatigue. This has been previously 
attributed to asthma, but we suspect a component of pulmonary 
HTN contributing to symptoms given he was without wheezing on 
exam and asthma would be unusual in this setting. He had no 
prior 2D-Echo studies. Given pulmonary hypertension was 
considered, we pondered possibly etiologies, including: 
connective tissue disorders (scleroderma vs. MCTD - will need 
outpatient lab screening), prior cocaine or substance use (not 
supported by his history), coronary disease (no history of such 
and no left ventricular systolic dysfunction on 2D-Echo) and he 
has no evidence of chronic thromboembolic disease on CT chest 
imaging. We performed a 2D-Echo this admission which was unable 
to evaluate his pulmonary artery pressure, but did note some 
symmetric LV hypertrophy with preserved regional and 
hyperdynamic global LV systolic function and no right 
ventricular dilatation. He will be scheduled for outpatient 
follow-up with Pulmonology to continue this work-up. He may 
require PFTs, polysomnography (to evaluate for OSA given a 
strong clinical story of sleep-disordered breathin). He had a 
negative CTA for thromboembolic disease. Pulmonology may also 
consider HIV screening, ___, ANCA, RF marker screening and may 
consider repeating the 2D-Echo. His oxygen saturations, at rest 
and with ambulation, remained above 94% prior to discharge.
.
# TRANSAMINITIS - The patient presented with unknown baseline 
LFTs, but this admission his AST was 97 and ALT was 117 with 
normal T-bili 0.5 and albumin 3.7, INR 1.1 (overall preserved 
synthetic function of the liver with no sequelae of liver 
disease noted). Possible etiologies included: alcohol abuse 
(AST/ALT ratio not suggestive) vs. hepatitis (serologies sent 
and pending upon discharge) vs. hemochromatosis (iron studies 
reassuring) vs. NASH (HbA1c 5.7% without hyperglycemia or 
evidence of insulin resistance) vs. medication effect. We 
encouraged him to follow-up with his primary care physician 
regarding further evaluation and monitoring.
.  
# CHEST PAIN - He presented with substernal chest discomfort 
that minimally improved with reactive airway disease treatment. 
His initial Troponin was < 0.01 times 2-sets with a flat CK-MB. 
Serial EKGs showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific 
ST-changes and normal sinus rhythm without concern for ischemia, 
respectively. Possible etiologies included: ACS/MI (negative 
cardiac biomarkers and reassuring EKGs) vs. PE (ruled out on CTA 
chest imaging) vs. PTX (no evidence on CXR) vs. musculoskeletal 
(some point tenderness on exam, reproducible) vs. asthma 
(possible component) or pleuritis vs. pericarditis (no EKG 
evidence of such) vs. anxiety. A CXR and chest CTA was negative 
for pulmonary embolus or consolidation, PTX or rib fracture. His 
pain improved with asthma treatment. He also has no prior 
cardiac history of cardiac catheterization procedures and his 
2D-Echo was not suggestive of ischemic cardiomyopathy - he had 
preserved global left ventricular systolic function. He did 
receive Aspirin 324 mg PO x 1 in the ED and his electrolytes 
were optimized. He was monitored via telemetry. He was stable 
prior to discharge.
.  
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY - The patient presented with a known, 
remote history of PSGN requiring short term dialysis (at ___), 
but with good recovery of his renal function. His creatinine was 
1.4 on initial labs with unknown baseline, but this likely 
represented mild ___ from volume depletion given his tachycardia 
and elevated lactate 3.0 on arrival. He received 3L NS in the 
ED. U/A showed concentrated urine, but was otherwise 
unremarkable. FeNa 0.4% on admission consistent with pre-renal 
etiology (UNa < 30). We encouraged PO hydration and trended his 
creatinine from 1.4 to 1.1 on discharge. We monitored his urine 
output, electrolytes and avoided nephrotoxins as well as renally 
dosed all his medications.
.  
# LEFT HIP PAIN - He apparently has severe enough left hip pain 
that he has started using a cane over the last few months, but 
this has apparently not been worked-up. It seems to be 
intermittent and localized to the lateral hip in the area of the 
iliac crest without radiation to the groin or tenderness over 
the trochanteric bursa. He has good ROM of the hip without pain 
with active motion. We deferred hip imaging this admission and 
encourage outpatient work-up with possible imaging and ___ 
evaluation.
.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
1. Patient dischared with evidence of left greater than right 
lung base atelectasis without consolidation on CT chest imaging. 
Continued palpable chest tightness with negative cardiac work-up 
and reassuring EKGs. Exertional dyspnea improved. Afebrile and 
WBC due to steroid leukocytosis. Low clinical threshold to treat 
with short-course of community-acquired pneumonia treatment if 
clinically declines.
2. At the time of discharge, blood cultures from admission were 
pending.
3. At the time of discharge, hepatitis serologies (including A, 
B and C) were pending and should be followed given his mild 
transaminitis. Iron studies reassuring overall; likely some 
component of iron deficiency anemia.
4. Bedside teaching of metered dose inhalers was provided this 
hospitalization and teaching regarding use of asthma medications 
was provided.
5. Has established follow-up with primary care physician and 
will need outpatient Pulmonology follow-up scheduled. 
Pulmonology will need to pursue further work-up, as needed.
6. Left hip pain stable with cane use to supplement ambulation - 
consider outpatient imaging studies vs. physical therapy 
evaluation.
7. Discharged on 5-day course of oral Prednisone 60 mg PO daily 
with no taper, for asthma exacerbation treatment.
