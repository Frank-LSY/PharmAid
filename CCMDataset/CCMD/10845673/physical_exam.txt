ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
General:  NAD
HEENT: NCAT,  no oropharyngeal lesions, neck supple
___: RRR
Pulmonary: breathing comfortably on RA
Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND
Extremities: Warm, no edema

Neurologic Examination:
- Mental status: Awake, alert, oriented to self, ___ ED, 
___. Able to relate history without difficulty. Attentive, 
able to name ___ backward without difficulty. Speech is fluent 
with full sentences, intact repetition, and intact verbal 
comprehension. Naming intact.  No paraphasias.  No dysarthria. 
Normal prosody. No evidence of hemineglect. No left-right 
confusion. Able to follow both midline and appendicular 
commands.

- Cranial Nerves: L pupil 4mm->3mm, R pupil 3->2, VF full to 
number counting, optic discs crisp bilaterally. EOMI but pt 
reports diplopia on far left gaze that does not improve with 
distance. Inside image disappears when he looks to the left with 
left eye closed. No nystagmus. V1-V3 without deficits to light 
touch, pin, or temperature bilaterally. No facial movement 
asymmetry. Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.  Palate 
elevation symmetric. SCM/Trapezius strength ___ bilaterally.

- Sensory: Decreased sensation to light touch and pin over left 
ear and just behind the left ear, spares neck. Decreased light 
touch and pin in entire left upper extremity circumferentially 
to over the shoulder. Medial forearm seems to have more 
sensation than lateral forearm but upper arm is entirely the 
same decreased sensation. No finger proprioception in left pinky 
all the way to the wrist, makes many mistakes when 
proprioception tested in left index finger but is better than 
left pinky finger. Sensation intact to LT, pin, temperature, and 
proprioception elsewhere. There is no spinal level.

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing 
bilaterally. Decreased speed with rapid alternating movements in 
LUE, LUE clumsy with trouble touching each individual finger to 
thumb.

- Gait: deferred

Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or 
organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No ___ edema.

Neurologic:

appendicular commands. No evidence of apraxia or neglect.

- Cranial Nerves: Slight anisocoria w/ L 4mm->3mm, R 3mm->2mm, 
VF full to number counting. EOMI, reports horizontal diplopia in 
primary gaze and both R and L gaze, binocular with inside image 
improving with L eye closed, improved with distance. V1-V3 
without deficits to light touch, pin, or temperature 
bilaterally. No facial movement asymmetry. Hearing intact to 
finger rub bilaterally.  Palate elevation symmetric. 
SCM/Trapezius strength ___ bilaterally. Tongue midline.

- Sensory: Decreased sensation to light touch and pin over left 
ear and LUE, more prominent in medial hand near ___ digit. Lack 
of proprioception throughout LUE, more prominent medially. 
Otherwise, sensation intact to LT, PP and proprioception 
throughout other extremities.
