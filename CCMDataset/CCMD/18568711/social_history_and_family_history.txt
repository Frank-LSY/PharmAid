Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service 
after undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral 
salpingectomy for pelvic pain and endometriosis. Please see the 
operative report for full details.
Her post-operative course was as follows:  Immediately post-op, 
her pain was controlled with PO oxycodone, tylenol, and 
acetaminophen.  Her urine output in the PACU was on the lower 
side, thought to be secondary to under-resuscitation, and 
improved with maintenance IV fluids.  Labs were notable for a 
hematocrit of 34 (stable from 32 pre-operatively) and a 
creatinine of 0.8.  She was restarted on maintenance IV fluids, 
and her oliguria improved.  On post-operative day 1, her urine 
output was adequate so her foley was removed and she passed a 
voiding trial (was back filled 300 cc's, and was bladder scanned 
for 0 cc's after voiding). Her diet was advanced without 
difficulty.
By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with instructions for outpatient follow-up.
