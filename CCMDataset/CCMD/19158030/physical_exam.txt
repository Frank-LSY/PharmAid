-Mental Status: Alert, oriented, attentive. Language is fluent
with intact repetition and comprehension. She is inattentive
during exam, requiring repeated redirection to keep her eyes
closed during various maneuvers. Normal prosody. There
were no paraphasic errors. Pt. was able to name both high and 
low
frequency objects. Able to read without difficulty.Speech was
mildly dysarthric, most prominently with guttural sounds. Able 
to
follow both midline and appendicular
commands, albeit with some hesitation and cueing required. When
asked to demonstrate common movements, she had some difficulty
showing me how she would brush her teeth or hammer a nail. When
asked to demonstrate these activities in more detail (putting
toothpaste on tooth brush etc) she was unable todo this. She was
not neglecting either side. She did seem rather blasÃ© about the
fact that she might have a stroke.
