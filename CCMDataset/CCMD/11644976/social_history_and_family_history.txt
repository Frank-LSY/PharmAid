PERTINENT STUDIES
============================
X-RAY KNEE (___)
No acute fracture or dislocation.
 
CT RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY (___)
Skin thickening and superficial soft tissue swelling throughout 
the right lower extremity extending from the level of the knee 
through the foot, suggestive of cellulitis.  No discrete fluid 
collection or bony abnormality.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ history of asthma admitted for right lower extremity 
cellulitis with purulent abscess in setting of recent MVC, now 
s/p drainage and subsequent improvement on vancomycin. Details 
as follows:
 
# COMPLICATED SKIN/SOFT TISSUE INFECTION OF RIGHT LOWER 
EXTREMITY
Initially presented for worsening erythema, swelling, and severe 
pain of the right lower leg after recent motor vehicle collision 
with abrasion to the area. He was initially treated with 
outpatient Keflex however symptoms continued to progress despite 
PO antibiotics. CT of the limb and clinical exam was reassuring 
against fasciitis or other surgical emergency. He underwent 
bedside drainage of the abscess and started on IV vancomycin 
with steady improvement in symptoms over subsequent days. 
Abscess was cultured however with no growth, therefore continued 
on empiric coverage for MRSA. At time of discharge he was 
planned to complete 7-day course of antibiotics from when 
therapeutic on vancomycin (Bactrim + Keflex for possible though 
lower suspicion of Strep infection). He will have ___ services 
to assist with abscess wick changes on a daily basis until wound 
resolved. 
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=============================
[ ] Plan to complete 7-day course Bactrim + Keflex from when 
vancomycin was therapeutic (last day ___.
[ ] Noted to have A1c 5.7 c/w pre-diabetes. Recommend ongoing 
discussion and counseling.
[ ] Noted to have mildly elevated ALT 54 without other LFT 
abnormalities. Given history of obesity is most likely due to 
fatty liver disease - recommend further discussion as 
outpatient.
[ ] Noted to be hepatitis B non-immune. Recommend outpatient 
vaccination series.
