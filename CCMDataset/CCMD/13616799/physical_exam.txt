- Cranial Nerves: PERRL 3->2 brisk. VF full to number counting.
+horizontal diplopia on L gaze and when covering the R eye, the
inside image disappears. L eye does not seem to fully abduct
(subtle). On sustained upgaze, pen turns very blurry and

movement asymmetry. Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
Palate elevation symmetric. SCM/Trapezius strength ___

Plantar response extensor bilaterally (vs withdrawal as pt is
very ticklish), no jaw jerk, +bilateral pectoralis jerk but no
cross adductors, no clonus 

- Sensory: Decreased sensation to pin prick on the R hand
compared to L hand (80% of normal), stops at the wrist.
Otherwise, no deficit to light touch or pin elsewhere. Decreased
sensation to proprioception in bilateral toes to large movements
(cannot move toe joint, must move entire toe), mild difficulties
in proprioception in bilateral index fingers to tiny movements

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing
bilaterally. 

- Gait: Needs help getting up from bed. Normal initiation. 
Narrow
base. Needs to hold on to people to walk, sways in place even
with feet apart. Seems to stumble while walking to the bathroom,
does not place feet on the ground entirely at times. Deferred
