**ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION**
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, MMM
Neck: Supple. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally 
Cardiac: RRR, nl. S1S2
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND.
Extremities: WWP.

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history 
without difficulty. Attentive, able to name ___ backward without 
difficulty. Language is fluent with intact repetition and 
comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors. 
Pt was able to name both high and low frequency objects.  Speech 
was not dysarthric. Able to follow both midline and appendicular 
commands. Pt was able to register 3 objects and recall ___ at 5 
minutes. There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI without 
nystagmus. Normal saccades. VFF to confrontation. 
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch and pinprick.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Mild decrease to hearing finger rub on right.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift 
bilaterally, but arms coarsely tremor during extension 2( due to 
fatigue).

Motor exam is difficult.  There appears to be true weakness, but 
there is a frequency component of ratcheting and possible 
give-away.  For example, during exam I am able to move his 
___, but ___ is later able to toe walk without significant 
difficulty.  

  Delt Bic Tri WrE FFl FE IO IP Quad Ham TA ___
L  5-    5-  ___-  5    4+ 4     5-*   4   5-
R  5 -   5-  ___-  5    4+ 4+    5-*   4+  5-

Hip Abduction appears full strength, perhaps weakness versus 
give away with Adduction.  

-Sensory: Complex exam.  In the RUE, three is essentially 
decreased sensartion to light touch and pinprick to 80% of 
normal throughout the limb, including the hand.  In the LUE, 
there is decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick roughly 
70% of normal throughout.

In the lower extremities, it is similar.  There is a general 
decrease in sensation proximally, with reported gradation 
distally to roughly 50% of normal sensation to lightouch and 
pinprick.  This sensory symptom is worse laterally.

Proprioception in intact at his great toes.  Graphesthesia 
intact at his b/l palms.

There is no sensory change in trunk or face.

-DTRs:
  Bi Tri ___ Pat Ach
L  2  2    2    3   2
R  2  2    2    3   2
Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.
+ Cross at b/l Knees

-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted. 
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.  There is a symmetric 
slowing of hand opening-closing without dysrhythmia.

-Gait: Good initiation. Narrow-based, steppage gait.  Can walk 
on toes.  Able to raise up on heels, but difficult.  Able to 
walk in tandem without difficulty. Romberg absent.

***DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION**
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, glasses in place, no conjunctival injection, MMM
Neck: Supple. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: No increased WOB 
Cardiac: No cyanosis
Abdomen: No distension
Extremities: Well-perfused

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, conversant. Able to relate history 
without difficulty. Attentive. Language is fluent with intact 
comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors. 
Speech was not dysarthric. Able to follow both midline and 
appendicular commands. There was no evidence of apraxia or

VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing grossly intact to voice
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout.

Strength is intact throughout with mild (but improved from 
prior) shaking give-away, more appreciable throughout on the 
left as compared to the right.    

  Delt Bic Tri WrE FFl FE IO IP Quad Ham TA ___
