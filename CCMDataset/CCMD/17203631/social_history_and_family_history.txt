IMAGING
================
NCHCT ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. Paranasal sinus disease. 
.
.
TEE ___:
Conclusions   
--The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the 
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection 
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. The ascending, transverse and descending 
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of 
atherosclerotic plaque to 30 cm from the incisors. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 
--IMPRESSION: No spontenous echo contrast or thrombus in the 
___. Mild mitral regurgitation.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx of afib on eliquis, HTN, HLD who presents with 
syncope.
.
# Syncope - ddx always broad and includes cardiogenic, neuro, 
neurocardiogenic and often based on hx and many cases never 
resolved. This patient's hx concerning for cardiogenic syncopy 
as he had apparent drop attack without prodrome. It is possible 
that patient had side effect from flecainide which in rare cases 
can cause VT/arrythmia. It can also prolong PR interval and PR 
was prolonged on initial EKG and reduced on repeat EKG later in 
ED. Low suspicion for seizure as witnessed and no rhythmic 
shaking or BBI. Also hx inconsistent with vasovagal or 
orthostasis as was sitting when event occurred and no 
premonition. Home flecainide was discontinued, he was monitored 
on telemetry while admitted and remained in sinus rhythm, normal 
rate without any symptoms. He is being discharged with plan for 
event monitor both for syncopal history as well afib (see 
below).
.
# Afib - Patient currently in NSR but per hx sounds that he 
often jumps in and out of afib and is symptomatic with 
palpitations and chest pain when those occur. He was scheduled 
for cardiac MRI on ___ with plan for ablation in ___ with 
Dr. ___. Given syncopal episode PVI/ablation was expedited. He 
underwent uncomplicated PVI. No arrhythmias were evoked so no 
further areas were ablated and etiology of syncope is still 
unknown. His home metoprolol XL 200 was initially fractionated 
to metop tart 50mg Q6H pre-procedure and reduced to 50mg BID 
post-procedure. Home apixiban 5mg BID was continued during 
hospitalization and afterward.

# HLD - cont home Rosuvastatin 5mg qOD
