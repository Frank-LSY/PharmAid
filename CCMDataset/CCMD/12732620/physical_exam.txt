she said "'clear' the table in the dining room" and "'I' heard
him speak on the radial last night".  Speech was not noticeably
dysarthric.  Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands.  She has no extinction to DSS but appears inattentive
to her left hemibody.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 3 to 2mm bilaterally.  Suspect a partial left lower
quadrant visual field cut (versus neglect) since she
intermittently makes mistakes seeing items in this area.
