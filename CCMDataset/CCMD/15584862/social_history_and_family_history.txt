Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old homeless man with a psychiatric 
history of bipolar disorder and substance use disorder (per 
BEST) who was brought to ___ ___ by ambulance with ___ 
Police Department for agitation and disorganized behavior. 
___ EMS reported to scene where patient was found with 
___ Police Department, reportedly yelling at 
people, walking into traffic, appearing manic, and rambling 
about being on a layover in ___ on his way to ___ from 
___. 
.
Diagnostically, patient appeared to have a history consistent 
with a manic episode as he was positive for grandiosity (people 
being jealous of him for his fame), flight of ideas, increased 
goal-directed activity (trying to find a place to live, going 
from ___ to ___ and planning on going to ___, and 
excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential 
for significant consequences (traveling as mentioned, helping 
people get across national borders). However, as patient was an 
unreliable historian, it was difficult to verify whether these 
claims made by patient were accurate and needed follow-up with 
collateral information (however, patient did not permit contact 
with family during his stay). While patient denied having 
periods of depression in the past and was also negative for 
other notable signs of mania such as decreased need for sleep or 
pressured speech (although this may have been masked as patient 
was very somnolent during admission), per BEST  he was 
previously diagnosed with BPAD and substance use disorder, and 
thus a high suspicion for mania was maintained. As patient had 
delusions, disorganized speech (frequent derailment and 
incoherence), and reported VH, a primary psychotic 
disorder/substance-induced psychotic disorder remained on the 
differential, especially since patient self-reported 
intermittent use of cannabis and hospital records from ___ 
___ showed positive urine toxicology for cocaine during an 
admission there in the last 6 months. As patient had a quick 
turn-around in symptoms with antipsychotic/mood stabilizers with 
being on the inpatient unit, a primary psychotic disorder is 
less likely and etiology is more likely an affective mood 
disorder with psychotic features and/or substance-induced 
psychotic disorder.
.
DSM 5 DIAGNOSES:  
- Bipolar I disorder, current or most recent episode manic, with 
mood-congruent psychotic features and/or substance-induced 
psychotic disorder
- Cannabis use disorder, cocaine use disorder, by history
.
#. Legal/Safety: In the ___, patient was agitated and paranoid, 
requiring Ativan 2 mg IM with security presence and physical 
restraints. Patient tried to leave despite being on ___ 
and security had to stop and escort him back to his room. 
Required ___ limb restraints and was given Haldol 5 mg IM 
with Ativan 2 mg IM and remained on CO. Patient was admitted to 
___ Inpatient Psychiatric Unit on a Section 12b; a CV 
was offered and patient signed but was rejected by admitting 
physician as patient was deemed not to have capacity to make an 
informed decision as he was extremely somnolent, denying that he 
needed admission to the unit (stated he was going to leave after 
getting sleep), denying that he has a mental health condition 
requiring acute stabilization, refused medical evaluation and 
workup (blood draw with admission labs that are necessary for 
discerning organic vs. psychiatric etiology of presentation, as 
well as an ECG) and denying/refusing that he needs to take 
psychiatric medications. Section 12b expired on ___ and a 
petition for ___ was filed on the same day. A court hearing 
was held on ___ and was not upheld by the court; the patient 
was subsequently discharged to the community on ___ per court 
order. He was placed on 15 minute checks while on the unit and 
had monitored access to sharps. He remained restricted to the 
unit as he displayed uncooperative behavior, paranoia and 
impulsivity which posed a risk of elopement. 
.
#. Bipolar I disorder, current or most recent episode manic, 
with mood-congruent psychotic features and/or substance-induced 
psychotic disorder: Patient was started on Risperidone 2 mg PO 
BID which was titrated to 5 mg PO BID and Lorazepam 1 mg PO qHS 
to initiate treatment for manic symptoms and to encourage sleep. 
Divalproex (extended release) was started at 1000 mg PO qHS on 
___ after notes/labs were obtained from ___ 
which showed LFTs that were within normal limits. Cogentin 0.5 
mg PO BID was given to prevent side effects of the 
antipsychotic. PRN medications offered included Lorazepam 1 mg 
PO q6H (anxiety, agitation) and Risperidone 2 mg PO TID 
(agitation). Medications were tolerated well without notable 
side effects. Admission labs for B12, folate, RPR, LFTs, lipid 
panel, A1c, TSH and ECG were continuously offered but refused.
.
By time of discharge, patient appeared to be more organized and 
showed linear, goal-directed and future-oriented thought process 
and denied any audiovisual hallucinations. He showed euthymic 
affect with a normal range and was less irritable/labile when 
compared to admission. He denied any suicidal or homicidal 
thoughts, or any desires/ideas/plans of self-harm. He was noted 
attending to his ADLs independently and appropriate. He remained 
having impaired insight into his mental health condition as he 
continued to state that he does not believe he has a mental 
health condition. He was offered but refused a release of 
information form (for faxing hospitalization information to a 
follow-up outside provider), a PCP/outpatient psychiatrist 
referral, a phone-call to arrange an appointment with an 
outpatient psychiatrist referred for him from his previous 
hospitalization at ___, and faxing of his 
discharge medication scripts to a pharmacy of his choice. Per 
his request, he was given medication scripts directly (he was 
discharged for Risperidone 5 mg BID and Divalproex ___ qHS). 
Patient was provided with paperwork with a list of 
hospitals/services he could receive help from if he were to 
need/seek both outpatient and acute mental health, housing, and 
substance use issues.
.
#. Alcohol Use: While patient reported having 1 to 3 beers a 
day, as he was an unclear historian and due to his status of 
homelessness and likely unavailability of consistent alcohol for 
consumption, more information was needed to confirm a diagnosis 
of alcohol use disorder. Regardless, patient was given folic 
acid 1 mg PO daily, thiamine 100 mg PO daily, and multivitamin 
with minerals 1 tab PO daily to prevent negative effects of 
___ alcohol use. During his stay on the inpatient unit, he 
did exhibit any signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
.
#. Cannabis Use: While patient's frequency/amount of use was 
unclear as per reasons stated above for alcohol use, he was 
offered education and counseling regarding the negative short 
and ___ effects of cannabis use and was encouraged that he 
follow-up for counseling with outpatient providers.
