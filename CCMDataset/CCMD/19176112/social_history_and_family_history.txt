Echo - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. LV systolic function appears depressed 
(moderate-to-severe) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior 
septum, and akinesis of the inferior free wall and posterior 
wall. The basal segments of the inferior and posterior walls are 
somewhat aneurysmal but not frankly dyskinetic. The overall left 
ventricular ejection fraction is approximately 30 percent. There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired 
relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  
.
Cardiac perfusion persantine - INTERPRETATION:  The image 
quality is adequate. Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged 
(EDV 186 ml), but does not worsen with stress. Rest and stress 
perfusion images reveal uniform a moderate severe fixed defect 
in the inferior wall at the base.  
Gated images reveal a dilated left ventricle with severe 
hypokinesis of the inferior wall and overall global hypokinesis. 
 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 37 %.  No 
priors. 
.  
IMPRESSION: 1) Moderate severe fixed defect in basal inferior 
wall. 2) Global hypokinesis, most severe in affected segment. 3) 
Dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 37%.

Stress portion of test - This is a ___ y.o. man with a history of 
prior MI and a recent history of worsening exertional angina. He 
The patient was referred to the exercise lab for a functional 
assessment of his CAD, however due to resting hypertension he 
was converted to a pharmacologic study. He was infused with 
0.142mg/kg/min of dipyramidole over 4 minutes. There were no 
reports of chest, arm, back, or neck discomfort throughout the 
study. There were no ST segment changes noted. The rhythm was 
sinus with a single isolated VPB noted during recovery. The 
patient was hypertensive at baseline with an appropriate 
response to the infusion. At ~8 minutes into recovery, the 
patient reported some vague chest discomfort with no ST segment 
changes or hemodynamic pertubations noted. The discomfort abated 
spontaneously. He was given 125mg of aminophylline during 
recovery without complication. 
IMPRESSION: Vague chest discomfort late in post-perfusion period 
without ischemic ECG changes noted. Nuclear report sent 
separately.
