Unexplained neutropenia with atypical lymphocytosis (followed by
oncology, S/P bone marrow biopsy), atrial fibrillation on 
Xarelto
and Tikosyn, HTN, remote drug-induced lupus (procainamide), and
relatively recent history of upper respiratory tract
infection/pharyngitis

Regarding his hematologic history, he had neutropenia and
atypical lymphocytosis in ___.  He underwent workup at that 
time
including bone marrow biopsy, peripheral flow cytometry, CT
torso.  He had an expanded population of double negative T cells
with polyclonal TCR gene, thought related to procainamide. 
Lymphocytosis resolved but neutropenia and leukopenia persisted. 

In ___ he had a 30 pound weight loss and underwent CT torso 
with
borderline splenomegaly, but no adenopathy.  He had a strep
negative pharyngitis requiring 2 courses of antibiotics.  He
underwent bone marrow biopsy in ___, but the findings were
nonspecific (slightly hypocellular marrow with increased CD8 T
cells).  An extensive workup was undertaken in late ___ 
with
consideration given to LGL, autoimmune lymphoproliferative
syndrome, autoimmune neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, and
inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.  His diagnosis remains
unclear.
