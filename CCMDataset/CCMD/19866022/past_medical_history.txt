Aside from the previous melanoma, ___ is otherwise quite 
healthy.
She has hypercholesterolemia, osteopenia, and a history of
constipation occurring over the past several months.  However,
she states that she underwent colonoscopy at an outside facility
one month ago without any specific findings.  She had a history
of transient hypothyroidism attributed to her earlier interferon
therapy, which has now resolved.  She has a history of
incontinence and underwent a bladder sling procedure with good
results.  She states that she had a recent echocardiogram
performed for perhaps a "long QT interval."  She has no known
cardiac history.  I did not have the results available.
