to read without difficulty. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to 
follow both midline and appendicular commands. Pt was able to 
register 3 objects and recall ___ at 5 minutes ___ with categ,

pin). Visual acuity ___ bilaterally with glasses on. 
Fundoscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or 
hemorrhages.
V: Decreased sensation to LT and temp in left V1-3 (V1/2 60% of 
normal to LT and temp; V3 30% of normal to LT and 60% of normal 
to temp); splits midline when tested across forehead and also 
with tuning fork
