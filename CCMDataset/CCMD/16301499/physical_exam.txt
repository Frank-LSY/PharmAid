General examination: 
General: Comfortable and in no distress 
Head: No irritation/exudate from eyes, nose, throat 
Neck: Supple with no pain to flexion or extension 
Cardio: Regular rate and rhythm, warm, no peripheral edema 
Lungs: Unlabored breathing 
Abdomen: Soft, non tender, non distended

Mental status:  
She is awake, alert, and cooperative with the exam.  She is
attentive, able to say months of the year backwards.  Fund of
knowledge is intact.  She is oriented to place and date. 
Language is fluent.  Memory for recent and remote history is
intact.  
Cranial nerves:  
Fundoscopic exam reveals sharp disc margins bilaterally.  Pupils
are equal and reactive.  Extraocular movements are full.  Facial
sensation and movement are intact and symmetric.  Hearing is
intact to finger rub bilaterally.  Palate elevates 
symmetrically.
SCM and trapezius are full strength bilaterally.  Tongue is
midline.  
Motor:  
Strength is full.  Tone is normal.  She has no pronator drift or
orbiting.  
Sensation:  
Crude touch is appreciated symmetrically throughout.  Position
sense is intact in the toes bilaterally.  
Coordination:  
Finger-nose-finger and finger-to-nose are intact without
dysmetria bilaterally.  
Reflexes:  
2 and symmetric.  Toes are downgoing bilaterally.  
Gait:  Narrow based with normal step height, stride length, arm 
swing,
and turns.  She is able to walk in tandem.
