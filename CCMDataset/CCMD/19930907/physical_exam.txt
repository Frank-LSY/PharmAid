ADMISSION EXAMINATION:

Vitals: 98.0 73 139/89 16 96% RA 
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in 
oropharynx
Neck: Supple. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally
Cardiac: RRR, nl. S1S2
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND.
Extremities: WWP.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented to person place and date. Able 
to
relate history regarding car crash without difficulty.  He is 
not
aware of his left sided weakness or sensory deficits and
excluding a headache reports he otherwise feels well.  Attentive
to examiner and tasks.  In the setting of the left hemisensory
neglect as below, he does acknowledge providers on both sides.
Language is fluent with intact repetition and comprehension.
Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors. Pt was able to
name both high and low frequency objects.  Speech was mildly
dysarthric but easily understandable. Able to follow both 
midline
and appendicular commands.  

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI without
nystagmus. Normal saccades. Visual fields with likely left
neglect versus left hemianopsia, but difficult to clarfiy. 
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch, but with intermittent
left neglect.
VII: Clear left UMN pattern facial droop.
VIII: Hearing intact room voice.
IX, X: Palate midline.
XI: Turns head side to side w/o difficulty.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. Left pronator drift
present. No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.  
Limited
strength assessment.  RUE and RLE appear grossly full to
contfronational strength testing.  LUE was perhaps subtly weak 
at
left deltoid and triceps.  LLE with mild weakness of IP, perhaps
hamstring.  unfortunately, due to urgency of intervention, full
exam unable to be performed.

-Sensory: Has left hemibody sensory extinction to DSS. 
Inconsistent neglect to left hemisensory light touch.  Otherwise
grossly intact to light touch and tickle.

-DTRs:
  Bi Tri ___ Pat Ach
L  2  2    2    3   1
R  2+ 2    2    3   1
- Pec jerk present on left, not present on right
- Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

-Coordination: No intention tremor.  Limited assessment of RAM. 
Mild LUE ataxia in proportion to weakness. 

-Gait: Unable to assess.
