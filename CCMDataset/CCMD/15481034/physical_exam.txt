Admission Exam:

Vitals:98.1F, HR 72, 125/80, RR 16, 96% on RA
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W
Cardiac: RRR, nl. 
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND
Extremities: No ___ edema.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history
without difficulty. Attentive, able to name ___ backward without
difficulty. Language is fluent slightly slowed with intact
repetition and comprehension - however, he does at time appear 
to
have trouble finding certain words when giving a history. Normal
prosody. There were no paraphasic errors. Pt is unable to name
low frequency word but this is complicated by ___ being a
second language.  Able to read without difficulty. Speech was 
not
dysarthric. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands. There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI: PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOMI without
nystagmus. VFF to confrontation.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: R facial droop - delayed activation.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. No asterixis
noted.
*Subtle weakness in R arm/hand - Slowed RAM on the R despite
being R handed. +Orbiting around R arm.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally - FNF on the right is
slower than the left.

-Gait: Good initiation. Narrow-based, normal stride and arm
swing. Feels subjectively that he is leaning to the right. 
Unable
to tandem. Romberg absent.
