Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old homeless man with unclear psychiatric 
diagnosis, previously diagnosed with mood disorder, PTSD, s/p 
numerous psychiatric hospitalizations with recent discharge from 
___ who presented to ___ ED after making suicidal 
statements at his homeless shelter. 
. 
History and presentation concerning for reported history of 
depressive symptoms beginning approximately ___ years ago in the 
setting of losing his mother to cancer with subsequent 
disappointment that his family did "not come together." In the 
setting of ongoing homelessness, unemployment and loneliness, 
patient initially reported worsening depression, SI, with 
reported NVS. Collateral from BEST concerning for possible 
underlying character pathology. 
. 
My interview with patient was limited secondary to uncooperative 
nature of patient, demonstrating help seeking and help rejecting 
behaviors. Patient admitted to repetitive nature of presenting 
to hospitals and stated that nothing has helped him in the past, 
refusing to elaborate on his experience or symptoms with this 
clinician. Notably, does not appear dysthymic or dysphoric on my 
examination, and  patient did state that he will state he is 
suicidal "because saying I'm in distress isn't enough to get you 
help." Nothing in his history or mental status examination to
suggest a history of mania and he is certainly not manic on my 
examination. No evidence to suggest a history of psychosis and 
he is not psychotic on my examination. Most likely etiology 
presentation is secondary to decompensated cluster B traits, 
although I cannot rule out an underlying MDD episode given his 
uncooperative nature nor can I rule out PTSD/complex trauma. 
Given young age and good health, an underlying medical condition 
is unlikely to be contributing to this presentation. Patient 
denies history of drug or alcohol abuse and tox screen was
negative. 
. 
#. Legal/Safety: patient admitted to ___ on a ___, upon admission he refused to sign a CV. Patient maintained 
his safety on 15 minute checks and did not require physical or 
chemical restraints.  
. 
#. Depression: as noted above
- Patient declined to participate in his care during this 
hospitalization, refusing groups, physical examination, 
laboratory work and to discuss the circumstances that led to his 
hospitalization. He was noted to be significantly help seeking 
and help rejecting as noted above, irritable at times. Reported 
to this clinician that he is alone because "no one can handle 
how I am because I tell it like it is." Given lack of evidence 
of major depressive episode, mania, psychosis, on my 
examination, again, I feel presentation is likely secondary to 
character pathology. Attempted to obtain collateral, but patient 
refused. 
- Of note, patient also declined all psychotropic medications 
during this admission. He denied suicidal ideation and thoughts 
of self harm and was in adequate behavioral control during his 
hospitalization. Given this and his desire to not be in the 
hospital with refusal of all psychiatric care, I did not feel he 
met ___ criteria at this time and thus he was discharged 
prior to expiration of his ___. 
- Of note, although I do believe Mr. ___ is at chronically 
elevated risk of suicide given male sex, homelessness, history 
of depression, poor psychosocial functioning, and limited 
supports, he does have a number of strengths: he is intelligent, 
has demonstrated the ability to seek help when distressed, and 
is educated. Given his denial of SI and thought process that is 
notably linear, logical, goal and future oriented, he is not at 
acutely elevated risk for suicide at this time. 
. 
#. Medical: no active medical issues during this hospitalization
