Brief Hospital Course:
#) Chest pain - EKG without ischemic changes suggestive of ACS. 
3 sets CEs negative. Has musculoskeletal component on exam. 
Exercise Stress Test: ___
INTERPRETATION: The patient exercised for 5.75 minutes of a 
modified ___ protocol (~ ___ METS). This represents a limited 
functional capacity for her age. The test was terminated due to 
a drop in systolic blood pressure. During exercise, the patient 
stated the discomfort was worse but continued to rate it at ___ 
on pain scale. There were no significant ST segment changes 
during exercise or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with no 
ectopy throughout the study. There was a drop in systolic blood 
pressure at peak exercise from 132/68 to 100/60 associated with 
mild dizziness. In the presence of beta blockade therapy, the 
peak exercise heart rate was blunted. 
IMPRESSION: Symptomatic drop in systolic blood pressure at peak 
exercise. Atypical anginal type symptoms in the absence of 
ischemic EKG changes. 
.
Pharmacologic Stress Test ___: 
No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes. 
Persantine MIBI (___)
INTERPRETATION: The image quality is adequate. Left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Rest and stress perfusion images reveal 
uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular 
myocardium.  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 63%.  
IMPRESSION: Normal persantine myocardial perfusion study; LVEF = 
63%.   
.
Likely costochondritis is etiology of chest pain.
