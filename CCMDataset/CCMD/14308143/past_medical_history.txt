metastatic breast cancer (see onc history
below) 
HTN 
HLD 
s/p bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 
s/p CCY 

Onc history: 
___- normal screening mammogram
___ right breast imaging was performed as the
patient noted pain and swelling of the right breast for ___
weeks; imaging showed new skin thickening with increased breast
tissue density with underlying subtle but hypoechoic masses in
the right breast; at the 8 o'clock position 8-9 cm from the
nipple there was an irregular subtle hypoechoic area measuring
1.7 x 1.9 x 1.1 cm; ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed
presumably of the same mass; this showed invasive ductal
carcinoma with apocrine differentiation, grade 2, measuring at
least 0.8 cm; -DCIS; -LVI; ER and PR were both weakly positive
(5% of tumor cells) with weak staining intensity; her2neu
negative (0)
___- CT C/A/P and bone scan showed evidence of extensive
metastatic disease. She has partial right lower lobe collapse
secondary to narrowing from a soft tissue mass, innumerable 
small
metastases throughout all lung segments, multiple right-sided
lower lung zone masses with additional masses in the right upper
lobe and lingula; enlarged mediastinal and hilar nodes, large
partially loculated right pleural effusion, right breast
thickening and enlarged right retropectoral and axillary
adenopathy, numerous osseous metastases with a destructive mass
involving the T1 vertebrae which should be further evaluated 
with
MRI to evaluate for presence of epidural component, extensive
peritoneal carcinomatosis, possible small left adrenal
metastasis; specifically on the bone scan she was noted to have
metastatic disease involving the spine and left iliac bone as
well as left acetabular/pubic bone
