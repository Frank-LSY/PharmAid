Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for 
elective incisional hernia repair. On ___, the patient 
underwent open incisional hernia repair with mesh, which went 
well without complication (please see the Operative Note for 
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the 
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, 
with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and epidural 
catheter for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically 
stable.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with epidural 
analgesia, which was converted to oral pain medication when 
tolerating clear liquids. The patient was started on sips of 
clears on POD# 1. Diet was progressively advanced as tolerated 
to a regular diet by POD# 2. The foley catheter was discontinued 
on POD 2 after epidural was discontinued to prevent urinary 
retention. The patient subsequently voided without problem. 
Patient was discharged home with JP drain in place to continue 
drainage.
