Physical Exam:
- General: sleepy, but cooperative 
- HEENT: NC/AT
- Neck: Supple
- Pulmonary: no increased WOB
- Cardiac: well perfused 
- Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended
- Extremities: no edema, pulses palpated
- Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Appears sleepy, needs frequent stimulation but
oriented x 3. Able to relate at least some of his hx. Attentive,
able to name ___ backward. Language is fluent with intact
repetition and comprehension. Pt was able to name both high and
low frequency objects. Speech was mildly dysarthric, when tired,
but with stimulation it appeared to improve. Able to follow both
midline and appendicular commands. There was no evidence of
neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 5 to 2mm and brisk. VFF to confrontation. 
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally. No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. 
Appeared full in BUE, 4+ throughout in BLE, but this appeared
very effort dependent 

-DTRs:  
       [Bic] [Tri] [___] [Quad] 
     L  2+    2+     2+      2+       
     R  2+    2+     2+      2+         
toes down on right and mute on left 

-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick throughout. No
extinction to DSS.

-Coordination: No intention tremor. Grossly no dysmetria on FNF
bilaterally.

-Gait: Deferred
