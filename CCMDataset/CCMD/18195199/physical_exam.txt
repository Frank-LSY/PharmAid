Radiologic Data:

Non-Contrast CT of Head ___:
Microvascular leukoencephalopathy with multiple small old
cerebral infarcts, left greater than right no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift.

CTA head and neck ___: 
1.  Occluded left ICA.
2.  Short segment 50-60% stenosis of the proximal right ICA.
3.  Patent anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries.

Chest x-ray ___:
Low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vasculature is accentuated due to
the degree of inspiration.  No focal infiltrates or visible
pleural effusions.

***************
ASSESSMENT:
Ms. ___ is a ___ old right-handed woman with a history of
hypertension, hypothyroidism and current smoking as prior left
MCA stroke in the setting of left ICA occlusion with near full
return to baseline now presents with sudden onset right-sided
plegia concerning for recurrent left MCA stroke. Her exam is
notable for intact language, cranial nerves, right arm plegia 
and
right leg paresis. CTA confirms a left ICA occlusion with distal
patency. Etiology of her repeat stroke may be secondary to
hypoperfusion event given the either extremely low flow or lack
of flow to the left ICA with an admit blood pressure of systolic
100. Given her intracranial atherosclerosis and now two strokes
on aspirin, will likely need to add an additional agent for
further protection. Will consider Plavix pending MRI without
microhemorrhages. Will admit to the neuro intermediate unit 
given
her pressure dependent findings. 

PLAN:
- Admit to Neurology Stroke Service, Attending Dr. ___  
 
# Neuro:  
- MRI head   
- Check risk factors: fasting lipid panel and HBA1c  
- Consider increasing/transitioning aspirin  
- Allow BP to autoregulate  
- activity: bedrest
- continuous IVFs
- ___ consults
 
# CV:  
- R/o MI with CE  
- Monitor by telemetry  
- Allow BP to autoregulate with goal SBP < 180 (goal SBP
140-180s)  
- Hydralazine 10 mg IV q6h prn SBP > 180  
- Hold home antihypertensives / halve dose of beta-blocker  
- no need to repeat trans-thoracic echo  

# Pulm:
- monitor sats
- screening CXR

# GI/Nutrition:
- NPO until passes dysphagia screen
- cardiac heart healthy diet once passess
- Bowel regimen with Senna, Colace 

# Renal: 
- baseline Cr normal
- continue to trend
- mIVFs @ 75

# Endo:
- TSH, A1C
- Finger sticks QID
- insulin sliding scale  

# Tox/Metabolic:  
- Check LFTs  
- Check urine and serum tox screens 

# ID:  
- Check UA  
- Check CXR

Prophylaxis and Hospital issues:  
- DVT: SQ heparin/pneumoboots  
- Precautions: fall

others.

CT brain: multiple chronic cerebral infarcts more prominent in
the left hemisphere than right hemisphere. No bleed. 

CTA brain/neck: occlusion of the left proximal ICA with
reconstitution at the level of the ophthalmic artery. 
50-60% stenosis of the right ICA. 

A/P: ___ year old woman who presents with recurrent left MCA
infarcts. Etiology is most probably due to embolic from left ICA
stump or watershed strokes.
