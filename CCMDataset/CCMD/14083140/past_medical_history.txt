PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
___ presented for her one-year follow-up mammogram for left
breast calcifications at which time she also reported a 2 week
history of a left breast lump. On ___, bilateral
diagnostic mammogram showed prior calcifications on the left 
that
were not significantly changed along with a new developing
asymmetry in that area of calcifications. Unclear if right
mammogram was completed. Same-day left breast ultrasound at
11:00, 3 cm from the nipple showed an irregular, hypoechoic mass
measuring 1.5 x 1.6 cm.  Possible extension was also noted from
dominant mass measuring 4 x 1.6 x 3.4 cm.  Left axilla was 
within
normal limits.  Same-day left breast ultrasound-guided core
needle biopsy with percutaneous clip placement revealed
infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 2, ER positive (greater 
than
95%) disease, PR negative (0%) disease, HER-2 equivocal by IHC
(2+), FISH positive, ratio (12.2).

We therefore recommended TCHP regimen: Taxotere, Cytoxan,
Herceptin & Perjeta. S/p 4 cycles c/b grade ___ fatigue, nausea 
&
diarrhea (most with ___ cycle, none with ___. Taxotere dose
reduced from cycle 1. After ___ cycle reported sleeping close 
50%
if not more of the day for the majority of her 3 weeks. ECOG was
borderline 2. Since ___ has had an excellent clinical
response to therapy, with no detectable mass on exam after ___
cycle we decided to stop ___ chemo after 4 cycles and
proceed with surgery.. Given overall toxicity, clinical 
response,
___ age and prior history of other regimens such as AC and
TC having relatively equivalent outcomes in 4 vs 6 cycle,  We
explained to ___, there is no randomized data supporting
this plan for this regimen as the original study BCIRG 006 study
by ___ et al ___ in NEJM was for 6 cycles of TCHP. She
understood and agreed with plan as presented.

On ___, had partial mastectomy with SLNB revealing evidence
of RCB class 1 residual disease. Has a foci of 11mm, 5mm, 3mm 
and
1.5mm, invasive cellularity is 5%. We reviewed the option of
completing an additional 2 cycles of chemo. Weekly paclitaxel +
HP x6 was offered instead of TCHP due to difficulty with prior
cycles.
