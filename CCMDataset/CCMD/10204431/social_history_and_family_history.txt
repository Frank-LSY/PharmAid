RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
.
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself due to expressed suicidal 
ideation. Her static factors noted at that time include chronic 
medical illness (diabetes) and history of suicidal ideation. The 
modifiable risk factors were also addressed at that time and 
noted to be lack of outpatient providers, limited social 
supports, recent substance use, and recent change in 
environment. During this admission, patient was referred to 
additional counseling services by liaising with school, parents 
were involved in her treatment and will be available/present for 
the next several days for support, and she was provided 
additional information about diabetes support counseling. 
.
Finally, the patient is being discharged with many protective 
risk factors, including her absent history of suicide attempts 
or self-injurious behavior, supportive parents, intelligence, 
optimism, and future oriented mindset. On discharge she 
demonstrated to have the preserved capacity to engage in a 
meaningful discussion about safety planning in the event that 
thoughts of suicide or self-harm arise in the future (e.g. call 
campus police, 911, or go to the emergency room). 
Based on the totality of our assessment at this time, the 
patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others.
