Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old F with a PMHx significant for anxiety 
and depression with multiple prior suicide attempts and one 
psychiatric hospitalization who presented with escalating 
anxiety, urges to engage in self-injurious behavior, and 
overdose with trazodone with intention of self-harm not 
lethality. Upon interview, patient endorsed worsening auditory 
hallucinations making derogatory statements and encouraging her 
to engage in self-injurious behavior and not to seek help. She 
reported depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep and appetite 
disturbances, feelings of hopelessness, and feelings of guilt. 
On exam, patient was cooperative and engaged, euthymic with 
reactive affect. Thought process was organized, logical and 
linear. She was not observed to be responding to internal 
stimuli. 
.
Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is likely 
multifactorial with likely primary mood disorder (high suspicion 
of major depressive disorder +/- psychotic features given 
description of ego dystonic auditory hallucinations) as well as 
underlying cluster B traits. Primary psychotic disorder seems 
less likely given thought organizations, intact cognition, and 
reactive affect. In a patient of this age would be hesitant to 
label this as a true personality disorder, however, would 
definitely keep character pathology on the differential. Patient 
also reported restrictive eating behaviors consistent with 
possible eating disorder. Patient also endorsed symptoms of 
worrying frequently about school, her social life, and her 
future as well as symptoms of panic including periods of 
tremulousness consistent with generalized anxiety disorder +/- 
panic disorder. Regardless of diagnosis, given her numerous risk 
factors that placed her at acutely elevated risk including 
single status, history of suicide attempts, recent overdose, 
history of psychiatric hospitalization, and age she certainly 
met inpatient level of care for diagnostic clarification, 
medication management, discharge and safety planning. 
.
#Legal/Safety
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout her admission. She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. Patient did 
not require any physical or chemical restraints during this 
admission. 
.
#Psychiatric: Unspecified Mood Disorder/Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder: with etiology as above with concern for depressive 
episode with underlying cluster B traits contributing
-Patient was noted to attend some group sessions during which 
she was engaged and talkative
-After discussion of the risks and benefits of several second 
generation antipsychotics including Risperidone and Zyprexa, 
decided to start Risperidone for treatment of auditory 
hallucinations and affective instability. Started Risperdal 0.5 
mg QD and 0.5 mg TID PRN. 
-Patient noted positive effect in terms of decreased anxiety and 
voices that were not as interfering, but noted feeling sleepy 
and cognitive slowing. Therefore, Risperdal dose was decreased 
to 0.25 mg QD and 0.25 mg TID PRN. She tolerated this well with 
no further complaints of side effects and with significant 
relief in anxiety and feeling overwhelmed. 
.
#Medical: No acute medical issues
.
#Risk Assessment
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
recent overdose, suicidal ideation and urges for self-harm.  Her 
static factors noted at that time include history of suicide 
attempts, history of abuse, history of chronic mental illness, 
Caucasian race, age, single marital status, and lack of local 
social support (family in ___. However, the patient has a 
number of strengths--she was engaged with her treaters, has 
motivation for treatment and demonstrated help-seeking behaviors 
by presenting to the emergency room. Of note, by the time of 
discharge, patient was noted to have a "good" mood, euthymic and 
reactive affect, denied suicidal ideation and her thought 
process was linear and goal-oriented and patient was future 
oriented reporting motivation for treatment. Patient's mother 
had flown in from ___ to over support for an indefinite 
amount of time. Patient withdrew from school for this semester 
with plan to lighten courseload when she does return to school. 
Patient and patient's mother felt comfortable with plan for 
discharge and follow-up with ___ Program scheduled for the 
day after discharge.
