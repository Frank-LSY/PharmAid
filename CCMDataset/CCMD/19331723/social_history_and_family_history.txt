Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. She was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Unspecified Depressive disorder 
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with no formal 
psychiatric history who was BIBA after witnessed near-syncopal 
event on ___ campus, subsequently endorsed depression, 
anxiety, and recent overdose on Ibuprofen. 
.
On admission interview, Ms. ___ endorsed isolative symptoms 
with suicidal thoughts, with recent (4 days prior) attempt to 
overdose on ibuprofen. Patient endorsed that depressive symptoms 
have been longstanding since childhood, and that her symptoms 
seemed to have started after hx of sexual assault when patient 
was ___ years old. Patient states that she has had longstanding 
social difficulties and does identify with the diagnosis of 
autism spectrum disorder, which was a diagnosis suggested by her 
therapist. On mental status exam patient maintains poor eye 
contact, appeared to have a reactive affect though initially 
flat and restrictive.
She appears to be minimizing her symptoms, though she did note 
that she is frustrated at herself for "always waiting until it 
gets really bad" to get help, which suggests that patient does 
have limited insight into her psychiatric condition. 
.
Diagnostically, Ms. ___ presentation is concerning for an 
unspecified depressive disorder with anxious features in the 
context of likely autism spectrum disorder. It is also possible, 
that given patient's trauma history, that her presentation could 
be best understood as part of a PTSD diagnosis. Throughout 
admission, patient demonstrated remarkable difficulty with 
verbalizing her emotional experience, and often seemed unaware 
of appropriate social cues. Regardless of final diagnosis, for 
the patient's depressive and anxious symptoms, she was started 
on Sertraline 25 mg PO daily. The patient tolerated the 
medication well without any reported side effects. The patient 
was also provided with individual and group therapies focused on 
coping skills for her symptoms. With these interventions, that 
patient reported an improvement in her mood, sleep, and 
appetite, with observed brightening of her affect and increased 
visibility in milieu with increased amounts of socialization 
with peers. Throughout admission, the patient denied continued 
suicidal ideation. On discharge, MSE was notable for improved 
mood, linear and future-oriented thought process, denial of 
suicidal ideation and brighter affect.

4. MEDICAL
None

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. At first, 
the patient was reluctant to attend group therapies, but after 
encouragement, the patient often attended these groups that 
focused on teaching patients various coping skills. Upon 
beginning of admission, patient was quite isolative and remained 
in bed for majority of day, but as admission progressed, the 
patient became increasingly social and was often visible in the 
milieu interacting with peers. The patient never required 
physical nor chemical restraint. 
.
#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Patient was quite resistant to the involvement of family in her 
treatment, and could only identify her ___ year old sister as 
possible source of support, but contact with sister was quite 
difficult and limited secondary to the patient being unable to 
provide contact information for her sister. Patient was 
eventually able to allow the treatment team access to her father 
for collateral information, but the patient self-identified her 
father as unreliable and uninvolved. Ultimately, the treatment 
team was able to speak with the patient's father in a family 
meeting on day of discharge. In this meeting, the patient and 
her father were given the chance to ask any questions they had 
about the treatment and discharge plan. The patient and her 
father were also provided with safety planning recommendation, 
and patient and father expressed understanding of ability to 
contact police if the patient's safety becomes a concern.
