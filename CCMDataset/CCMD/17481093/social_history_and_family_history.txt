Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to us as a transfer with the following 
documented injuries: R C7 pedicle fracture, L posterior ___ 
rib fracture, L clavicle fracture and L scaphoid fractures. No 
new injuries were discovered upon further examination. She was 
admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service for pain management 
and consultations were placed with Orthopedics and Neurosurgery. 
Given her focal paresthesias on her right arm there was concern 
for spinal cord compression. An MRI of her C spine was done on 
HOD1 and did not reveal any spinal cord compression. 
Neurosurgery recommended a C-collar to be worn at all times 
until a follow up appointment with them in 2 weeks. Orthopedics 
also evaluated this patient for her minimally displaced oblique 
middle third left clavicle fracture. They recommended 
non-operative treatment with sling immobilization and non-weight 
bearing. Follow up was scheduled with them in 2 weeks. No other 
acute interventions were recommended. OT was also consulted and 
evaluated the patient on HOD1. They recommended discharge to 
home with outpatient OT. On HOD2 the patient's pain was well 
controlled on oral pain medications. She was tolerating a 
regular diet and was passing gas. A tertiary survey was 
completed with no new findings. She was deemed ready for 
discharge by the main acute care surgery teams. All follow ups 
were scheduled per recommendations of consulting teams. The 
patient was sent home in stable condition.
