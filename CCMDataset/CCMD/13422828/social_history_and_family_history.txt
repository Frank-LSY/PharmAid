Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was was admitted to urology for right 
obstructing ureteral stone with
acute kidney failure and underwent cystoscopy, right retrograde 
pyelogram, right placement of double-J stent. She tolerated the 
procedure well and recovered in the PACU before transfer to the 
general surgical floor. See the dictated operative note for full 
details. Overnight, the patient was hydrated with intravenous 
fluids and received appropriate perioperative prophylactic 
antibiotics. On POD1, catheter was removed and CT scan for 
residual stone burden was obtained. She had acute kidney injury 
without improvement in her creatinine on POD1 so she was kept 
overnight for observation and consultation with our colleagues 
in nephrology. With gradual improvement she was discharged on 
POD2 tolerating regular diet, ambulating without assistance, and 
voiding without difficulty. She was explicitly advised to follow 
up as directed as the indwelling ureteral stent must be removed 
and or exchanged and to have repeat lab work done.
