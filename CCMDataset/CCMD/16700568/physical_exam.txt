-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history
without difficulty. Attentive, able to name days of the week

notable for less than full abduction bilaterally, with rightward
beating nystagmus when looking to the right and then leftward
beating nystagmus looking to the left.  Consequently he has
horizontal diplopia, mild on the left with only blurring of
objects but on rightward gaze, he sees nearly 2 complete 
objects.
Head impulse test attempted however with inconsistent results,
