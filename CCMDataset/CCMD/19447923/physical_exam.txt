Physical examination:

General: The patient is well-appearing with normal affect.  No 
apparent distress.

HEENT: Neck is supple with full range of motion.

Cardiac: Regular rate.

Respiratory: Breathing audibly on room air.  Regular rate.

Vascular: The left hand is well-perfused with capillary refill 
less than 2 seconds in all 5 digits.
  
Neurologic: Sensation is intact in the radial ulnar and median 
nerve distribution, to include the ulnar and radial digital 
nerve of the left third digit, distal to the laceration site.

Musculoskeletal: Focused examination of the left third digit 
demonstrates a transverse laceration which went 
circumferentially along the ulnar border.  The laceration is 
well approximated and closed with nylon suture.  There is no 
erythema or drainage. Slight increased warmth starting at the 
dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joint extending distally 
throughout the digit. There is tenderness with palpation about 
the proximal phalanx and extending proximally along the radial 
border of the digit and about the dorsum of the in MP joint.  
Pain cannot be localized about the MP joint. There is 2+ edema 
at the dorsum of the MP joint.  There is no evidence of 
advancing erythema up the extremity to include lymphatic 
streaking.  FDP and FDS tendon are intact.  No worsening 
tenderness of flexor tendons.
