sensation and movement are intact and symmetric.  Hearing is
intact to finger rub bilaterally.  Palate elevates 
symmetrically.
SCM and trapezius are full strength bilaterally.  Tongue is
midline.  
Motor:  
Tone is normal.  She has no pronator drift.  Strength is full,
except for at ___ extension which is ___ on left and 4+/5 on the

tibialis
anterior, gastrocnemius, an toe flexion/extension. 
Sensation:  
Patient reports hyperesthesia to crude touch and pinprick in
L5-distribution on the dorsum of both feet. Patient can
appreciate large upward and downward excursion of giant toe, but
not small one. 
Coordination:  
Finger-nose-finger and finger-to-nose are intact without
dysmetria bilaterally.  
Reflexes:  
Patient does not have ankle reflexes, but other reflexes are
intact and symmetric. Plantar reflexes are flexor.
