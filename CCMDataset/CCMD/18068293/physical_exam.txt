 Neck: Supple.
 Pulmonary: CTA on the left 
 Cardiac: RRR though mildly tachycardic, no murmurs
 Abdomen: soft, nondistended
 Extremities: Warm and well perfused
 Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
  
 Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert and inattentive, makes mistakes with 
naming
the ___ backward.  Able to relate history though has some

Pt. was able to name both high and low frequency objects on the
stroke card.  Able to read a sentence.  Described the cookie jar
picture accurately.  Speech was not dysarthric.  Able to follow
both midline and appendicular commands. 
 

-Cranial Nerves:
 I: Olfaction not tested.
 II: PERRL 3 to 2mm; brisk bilaterally.  VFF to confrontation
with no extinction to double simultaneous stimulation.
 III, IV, VI: EOMI. no ptosis is seen.  There is subtle gaze
evoked nystagmus -right beating with rightward gaze and left
beating with a clockwise torsional component on leftward gaze;
this does not extinguish.
 V: Facial sensation intact to light touch in all distributions
 VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric 
 VIII: Hard of hearing at baseline.  Hearing absent to finger 
rub
bilaterally, present leaning forward vibration bilaterally.  The
Weber test lateralizes to the right ear.  
 IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
 XI: Shoulder shrug is symmetric.
 XII: Tongue protrudes in midline with full range of motion left
and right.

 -Motor: No pronator drift bilaterally.  Mild left-sided 
postural
tremor noted.

without retropulsion though stumbles to the right soon after
standing up.  She sways when she puts her feet together with
