Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was transferred to the ___ ED from 
___ with heavy vaginal bleeding. On ___, she was 
admitted to the inpatient gynecology service for observation of 
her heavy vaginal bleeding and acute blood loss anemia. While in 
the ED, she received tranexamic acid, fluid resuscitation, and 
was started on progesterone. She did not require blood products 
and her bleeding stabilized. Her laboratory work up was notable 
for an isolated elevation of her PTT. For this, hematology was 
consulted and recommended further work up. Given the stability 
of the patient's bleeding, vital signs, and symptoms, they 
recommended this work up be completed as an outpatient.
