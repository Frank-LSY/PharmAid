ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VS T:98.5 HR:65 BP:144/72 RR:19 SaO2:96RA
GEN - well appearing, well developed
HEENT - NC/AT, MMM
NECK - full ROM, no meningismus
CV - RRR
RESP - normal WOB
ABD - soft, NT, ND
EXTR - atraumatic, WWP

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
MS - Awake, alert, oriented x 3. Attention to examiner easily
attained and maintained. Concentration maintained when recalling
months backwards. Recalls a coherent if vague history. Structure
of speech demonstrates fluency with full sentences, and normal
prosody. No paraphasic errors. Intact repetition, naming, and
comprehension. Unable to check reading due to poor visual 
acuity.

CN - [II] PERRL 1.5 and sluggishly reactive. Poor visual acuity
secondary to macular degeneration. [III, IV, VI] EOMI. [V]
Reports decrement of L V1-V3 to LT and PP, ~50% of normal. [VII]
Does not activate well with volitional smile, requires 
persistent
coaching. Will intermittently activate the left corner of the
mouth, and then smile with only the right side. [VIII] Hearing
intact to voice. [IX, X] Palate elevation symmetric. No
dysarthria. [XI] SCM/Trapezius strength ___ bilaterally. [XII]
Tongue midline with full ROM.

MOTOR - Requires a great deal of encouragement to move left 
side.
When checking for pronator drift, she actively resists me when I
attempt to elevate the LUE. She is able to hold the LUE
antigravity, though quickly drifts downward without pronation.
There is give-way weakness throughout the left side making
accurate strength assessment very difficult.

SENSORY - Reports decrement to LT and PP over the LUE (50% of
normal) and LLE (25% of normal).

Plantar response extensor on the L, down on the R.
*S/p L knee surgery.

COORD - No dysmetria on FNF w RUE, fair RAM with R hand. 
Performs
FNF very slowly with LUE and consistently misses target (aims
just below my finger every time, despite persistent correction).
Performs tapping of each finger to thumb correctly and 
accurately
with L hand x1, then on subsequent trials taps at the base of
each finger with the L thumb.

GAIT - Deferred.
