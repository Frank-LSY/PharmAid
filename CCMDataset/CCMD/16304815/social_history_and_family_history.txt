Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service for 
further management of his pain and observation of his injuries. 
He continued to recover well on the floor without issues. His 
pain was well controlled and he was able to pull volumes of 
1000-1500mL with his incentive spirometer consistently through 
his stay. Further history revealed possible presyncope before 
his fall. An echocardiogram was ordered which revealed no 
structure cause of possible syncope. He was assessed by Physical 
Therapy and Occupational Therapy and deemed appropriate for 
discharge home with home physical therapy. A repeat chest x ray 
revealed a stable to improved right pneumothorax. The patient's 
pain from his rib fractures was easily controlled with oral 
medications.
