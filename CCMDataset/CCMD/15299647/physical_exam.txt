Neurologic:

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history
without difficulty. Attentive, able to name ___ backward without
difficulty. Language is fluent with intact repetition and
comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors.
Pt was able to name both high and low frequency objects.  Able 
to
read without difficulty. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to
follow both midline and appendicular commands. There was no
evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
II, III, IV, VI:  PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. EOM appear full with
b/l end gaze nystagmus. Vertical diplopia on primary gaze,
worsened when looking up as well as upwards to the right and to
the left. When his left eye is covered the upper image
disappears. When his right eye is covered the lower image
disappears. There is no clear misalignment/skew on light reflex.
No ptosis. No clear refixation with cover/uncover test with each
eye. However, when doing alternate cover test, there does appear
to be refixation in the vertical plane. VFF to confrontation. 
Red desaturation with right eye compared to left when testing
with red ID. Blurry vision in his right eye when isolated
compared to his left eye. 
There may be blurring of the right optic disc margin on
evaluation of optic discs. 
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. No asterixis
noted.

=====================================================
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
Unchanged except:

Vertical diplopia on primary gaze, worsened with midline 
downgaze, improved with midline upgaze. Worse with leftgaze. 
When right eye is covered the lower image disappears. No 
refixation visible with cover/uncover testing. No  
misalignment/skew on light reflex. Equivocal induced ptosis on R 
with 30 sec of upgaze. VFF to confrontation. No red 
desaturation.
