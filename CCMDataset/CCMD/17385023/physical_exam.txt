appears to be an inferior altitudinal defect to finger wiggle. 
Right eye roughly ___, left eye roughly ___ to bedside
testing.
 III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus.  Normal saccades.  No
fatigability with prolonged upgaze.
 V: Facial sensation intact to light touch, pinprick in all
distributions
 VII: There is clear left ptosis (chronic since eye surgeries). 
Otherwise, No facial asymmetry and ___ strength in upper and
lower distributions, bilaterally 
 VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
 IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
 XI: ___ strength in trapezii bilaterally.
 XII: Tongue protrudes in midline and deviates side to side w/o
difficulty.

Adductors
are present bilaterally.

throughout. No extinction to DSS.

-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.

DISCHARGE EXAM

II: ___ OD, ___ OS. Prominent L ptosis is chronici.  
PERRL 3 to 2mm in right eye. Left pupil 3mm, surgical fixed .  
VF full in right eye.  Left eye VF poor chronic, able to detect 
light, no finger wiggle III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus.   
No fatigability with prolonged upgaze. L ptosis interferes with 
sustained upgaze and she intermittently endorses 2 vertical 
objects that go away when she refixes.  There is no diplopia in 
any other direction of gaze.
