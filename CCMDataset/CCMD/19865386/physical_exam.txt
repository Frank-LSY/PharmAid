Plantar response flexor bilaterally

- Sensory: No deficits to light touch.

- Coordination: Very mild dysmetria on FNF that actually 
appeared
worse on left (although with O2 sat on left finger). Possible
mild overshoot on mirroring, again possibly worse on the left.

bilaterally. No truncal ataxia.
