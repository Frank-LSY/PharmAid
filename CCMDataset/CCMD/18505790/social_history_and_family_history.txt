Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to pre-op on ___. Patient was 
evaluated by anaesthesia.  
The patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic 
sleeve gastrectomy for obesity. There were no adverse events in 
the operating room; please see the operative note for details. 
Pt was extubated, taken to the PACU until stable, then 
transferred to the ward for observation. 
 
 Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a PCA. Pain was 
very well controlled. The patient was then transitioned to 
crushed oral pain medication once tolerating a stage 3 diet. She 
did not require any pain medication on the day of discharge. 
 CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.  
 Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.  
 GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO. Afterwards, the 
patient was started on a stage 1 bariatric diet, which the 
patient tolerated well. Subsequently, the patient was advanced 
to stage 2, and then stage 3 diet. She had issues with nausea 
and small volume emesis and as such her diet was slowed down 
slightly. She also received Zofran and Phenergan to help with 
her nausea. She was eventually advanced to a normal stage 3 diet 
which the patient was tolerating on day of discharge without any 
discharge. 
 ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs 
of infection, of which there were none.  
 HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding. She had a HCT drop from 37.9 on POD0 to 29.7 on 
POD1. Repeat HCT in the afternoon on POD1 was stable at 29.8. 
Repeat HCT on POD2 was stable at 29.8. Repeat HCT on POD3 was 
stable at 29.2. Given her stable HCT there was no concern for 
active bleeding.   
 Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay, but HSQ was held after 
HCT drop on POD1. Patient was encouraged to get up and ambulate 
as early as possible and she actively walked several times a day 
throughout her stay. 
 At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating a 
bariatric stage 3 diet without nausea/vomiting, ambulating, 
voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The 
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions 
with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge 
plan.
