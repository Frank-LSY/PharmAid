ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
============================
Vitals: T 97.7  P 78  BP 167/74  RR 19  97% RA 
General:  NAD, obese
HEENT: posterior occiput tenderness to palpation, no
oropharyngeal lesions, neck supple
___: RRR, no M/R/G
Pulmonary: CTAB, no crackles or wheezes. Can count to 31 on
single exhaled breath.
Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no guarding
Extremities: Warm, bilateral edema R>L up to knees. Mildly
increased arch size on the right, likely more due to atrophic
changes.

Neurologic Examination:
- Mental status: She is alert, oriented.  She is attentive, able
to name months of the year backwards without hesitation.  Has
intact recent memory, knows that the ___ Sox are playing their
fourth game today.  Language is fluent.

- Cranial nerves: Pupils are equally reactive, 4-3 mm
bilaterally. Smooth pursuit is preserved.  On saccadic testing,
she has occasional hypometric saccades but no limitations in  
eye
movements.  Her face is symmetric.  Facial sensation is intact 
to
pinprick bilaterally.  Palate elevates symmetrically.  There are
no tongue fasciculations or atrophy.  There is no dysarthria.

- Motor: Grossly, there is no significant muscle wasting.  No
fasciculations were observed.  No tremor at rest, however, there
is a coarse, right slightly greater than left but present in
bilateral hands ___ Hz tremor which is most prominent on
finger-nose-finger as well as with posture.  Rapid alternating
movements are intact with no evidence of bradykinesia.  She
develops mild rigidity with augmentation maneuvers in her left
greater than right arm.  There is occasional vocal tremor.  Tone
is normal to slightly decreased at the ankles.
There was no fatigability after 40 deltoid pumps.
Neck flexion 4, neck extension 4-

R   4     5    5    5    ___-   5     4+  3    5    2
In addition to above, thigh ABductors were full, ADductors were
slightly weak. Ankle inversion notable for 3 on the right, 2 on
the left. Ankle eversion 4 on the right and 3 on the left. There
was atrophy of the EDB bilaterally.
 
- Reflexes: 
   [Bic] [Tri] [___] [Quad] [Gastroc]

 R  3+    2+     3+      3+       1  
Plantar response flexor bilaterally, no ankle clonus. Positive
crossed adductors bilaterally, negative ___ sign. 

- Sensory: Distal pinprick testing revealed reduction with left
worse than the right, involving the fingers up to her palms.  
The
right side was described as about 80% of normal, the left side
with describes about 50% of normal.  Proprioception of the thumb
bilaterally was intact.  In the lower extremities, there was
right greater than left distal decrease to pinprick to about 70%
of normal, up to upper shin on the right and ankle on the left. 
Proprioception was preserved bilaterally.  However, vibration 
was
markedly asymmetric, with the right at 14 seconds and left at 4
seconds.

- Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose testing
bilaterally. Intention tremor as above. Good speed and intact
cadence with rapid alternating movements.

- Gait: Has mild difficulty climbing out of bed but is able to 
do
so without assistance.  Walks with a cane with a slightly high
steppage gait.
