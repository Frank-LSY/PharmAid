History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a hx of HTN, HLD, 
Grave's disease, discoid lupus (in remission x ___ years) who 
presents with pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology 
now s/p pericardiocentesis. She was in her usual state of health 
until 3 weeks ago when she experienced 2 days of fever/chills, 
feeling generally unwell after getting a flu shot. She felt 
better on the third day and was doing well until this weekend 
when she experienced similar symptoms, which she took Tylenol 
for. She was also experiencing intermittent palpitations and 
worsening shortness of breath but no chest pain. She expected 
her symptoms to resolve but they did not so she presented to her 
PCP office on ___ and they told her to seek evaluation at 
___ on ___. 

In the ___ she was found to be tachycardic with an irregular 
rhythm, although there was some uncertainty whether this was 
sinus with ectopy vs afib. SBPs were initially 130s-140s. CXR 
showed large cardiac sillhouette and small ___ effusions. CT 
obtained to r/o PE showed 2.2-2.7 cm pericardial effusion. 
Pulsus pardoxus was measured by ___ at 15. Dr ___ 
thoracic surgery was consulted in the ___ and did not feel that 
the patient required emergent pericardiocentesis. The patient 
stayed in the ___ overnight as no tertiary care beds were 
available. O/n the patient received 5 mg IV lopressor her HRs 
trended down slightly and her dyspnea improved somewhat. Stable 
this am on RA.  Bedside ECHO done with 2.1 cm effusion with some 
fibrin noted, EF 70%, PASP 36, some collapse of RA/RV and resp 
variation across the TV.

She was transferred to ___ and underwent successful 
pericardiocentesis with 230cc of fluid drained, pericardial 
drain placed and then transferred to the CCU for further 
management.

On arrival to the CCU, patient states that she is feeling much 
better than before but is having some soreness at the site of 
the drain placement. Otherwise she denies chest pain, current 
shortness of breath, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
leg swelling, dysuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
Positive per HPI.  

On further review of systems, denies fevers or chills. Denies 
any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, 
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. 
Denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review 
of systems were negative.

sudden cardiac death.  
Both of her parents died of strokes in their ___.

STUDIES: 
===================
CTPA ___
IMPRESSION:
1. New pericardial effusion.
2. New left pleural effusion and tiny right pleural effusion.
3. New bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
4. No change in subtle left upper lobe parenchymal infiltrate.
5. Old right rib fractures.

+ TTE ___: Per report  ECHO done with 2.1 cm effusion with 
some fibrin noted, EF 70%, PASP 36, some collapse of RA/RV and 
resp variation across the TV.

TTE ___:
Conclusions   
 Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a very 
small circumferential pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo 
dense anteriorly, consistent with blood, inflammation or other 
cellular elements. Neither tamponade physiology or constriction 
are suggested, though transmitral/transtricuspid flows could not 
be assessed due to the tachycardia. Small right pleural 
effusion.

 IMPRESSION: Very small circumferential pericardial effusion 
without definite evidence for tamponade or constrictive 
physiology.   

CXR ___:
Comparison to ___.  Removal of the pulmonary artery 
catheter.  
Stable mild left pleural effusion with subsequent retrocardiac 
atelectasis.  
Stable appearance of the lung parenchyma.  No pulmonary edema.  
No pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a hx of HTN, HLD, 
Grave's disease, discoid lupus (in remission x ___ years) who 
presented with pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology 
now s/p successful pericardiocentesis with persistent mild sinus 
tachycardia thought secondary to pericardial inflammation. Her 
home losartan was held in the setting of low blood pressure but 
was normotensive at the time of discharge, this should be held 
until recheck at PCP follow up.

#Pericardial effusion now s/p pericardiocentesis - Etiology of 
effusion unclear at this point, multiple studies pending from ___ 
___ as well as ___ at time of discharge. DDx included 
post-viral, which seemed most likely given recent viral symptoms 
but could also be related to other infectious etiologies vs. 
rheumatologic process vs. thyroid dysfunction (although TSH nl) 
given history vs. malignancy. Patient was placed on NC O2 for 
comfort but ambulated with SPO2 92% at discharge.

#Sinus tachycardia - persistent after pericardiocentesis, likely 
due to residual pericardial fluid vs. potentially hypovolemia, 
no other clear signs of infection prior to discharge, improved 
with 500cc of normal saline, but was still persistent at 
discharge.

#Hyponatremia, resolved - mild hyponatremia to 133 at ___ 
___, resolved prior to discharge

#Acute kidney injury, resolved - Cr up to 1.2 at ___ from 
baseline of 1.0, was thought to be pre-renal in the setting of 
near-tamponade and resolved prior to discharge with discharge Cr 
0.6.

#HTN - Held losartan 20mg QD given soft pressures

#HLD -Continued atorvastatin 20mg QHS

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
-Please order transthoracic echo to follow up pericardial 
effusion within 1 week of discharge.
-Follow up RF, ___, EBV, VZV, HIV, ___, ESR from ___.
-Follow up pending pericardial fluid studies.
-Losartan was held at discharge given normotension. Please 
restart at followup if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were experiencing 
palpitations and shortness of breath. You were found to have 
fluid built up around your heart (pericardial effusion), which 
was drained. You were monitored afterwards and did not have 
fluid build up again. You felt much better after the fluid was 
drained and we felt it was safe for you to leave the hospital.

Please continue to take your medications as directed. Your 
losartan was held because your blood pressures were on the low 
side. You should discuss restarting this medication with your 
doctor. You will also have a follow up appointment with 
Cardiology as below.

Please see your doctors as directed.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your ___ Care Team
