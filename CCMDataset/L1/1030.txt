Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ came to the hospital because of headache and high blood

cluster of blood vessels which ___ were probably born with. ___ 
had a special procedure which showed ___ did not have an 
aneurysm. 

We are changing your medications as follows:
- We are increasing your losartan from 100 mg daily to 150 mg 
daily to better control your blood pressure. This is important 
to prevent further bleeding. 
- We also stopped your aspirin as it can increase your risk of 
bleeding. 

Now that ___ are leaving the hospital we recommend the 
following:
- Please follow-up with your doctors as listed below

We wish ___ the best,
