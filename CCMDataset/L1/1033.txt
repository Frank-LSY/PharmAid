traverse. There was some nodularity at the GJ junction. No ulcer 
noted. The blind limb appeared normal. (biopsy)

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with a history of 
roux-en-Y gastric bypass with history of a marginal ulcer 
admitted to the hospital on ___ due to new onset 
epigastric pain in setting of known smoking.  Upon arrival, she 
was placed on bowel rest with intravenous fluids and antiacids.  
Po's were trialed on HD2 due to resolution of pain, however, the 
patient's pain returned.  She subsequently underwent an EGD on 
HD3, which did not show a marginal ulcer, therefore, her pain 
was attributed to a possible ulcer in the remnant stomach.  
Post-procedure, as she remained hemodynamically stable with 
improved pain and tolerance to a stage 3 diet, she was 
discharged to home on omeprazole.  She will follow-up with Dr. 
___ in clinic within the next few weeks.
